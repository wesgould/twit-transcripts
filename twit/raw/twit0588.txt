[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.520]   So much to talk about this week.
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.200]   Of course, the election was at Facebook's fault.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.360]   Mark Zuckerberg says, no, our panel says, yeah,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.440]   what's happening to Twitter?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.640]   We think they should just give it away.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.920]   And a bunch of DDoS attacks and the new emoji are here.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.480]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.480]   On Twit.

[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.920]   This is Twit.

[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.000]   Episode 588, recorded Sunday, November 13, 2016.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.920]   New phone, who this?
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.720]   This week in Tech is brought to you by GoToMeeting.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.480]   Why just phone conference when you can go high tech?

[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.240]   Don't phone it in.

[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.760]   the show where we cover the latest Tech News.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.320]   What a great panel I like having the young people on.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.280]   Do you really--
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.080]   No.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.120]   I hate you millennials.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.320]   No, I love it.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.040]   Alex Wilhelm is here from Mattermark.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.920]   Everyone, give it back.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.080]   Great to see you.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.920]   And you brought another young person with you.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.320]   I did.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   My dear, dear friend, Lauren Hockinson.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.120]   Love Lauren.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.960]   And we actually missed you a little bit
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.720]   because you dropped out of the Tech journalism scene.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.360]   I did.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.860]   Yes.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.360]   How's that say?
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.520]   It's a society, really.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.320]   We're all wanting to do that now.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.160]   To be honest with you, it's been very relaxing.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.840]   I got on a fitness journey.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.720]   It was really good.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.160]   Oh, good.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.840]   Good for me.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.200]   Oh, good.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.000]   You know the smallest journey begins with a single Big Mac.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.280]   So you're doing a podcast, though, called Nothing Matters.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.800]   Correct.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.560]   It's called Nothing Matters.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.920]   I bet your numbers are going to go through the roof this week.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.640]   I hope so.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.000]   You talk about the--
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.920]   would you say the tire fire of the internet?
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.600]   Yeah, the internet's garbage.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.120]   We talk about the garbage on the internet.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.000]   So mostly Twitter, everything, though, politics, music, pop
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.440]   culture, the Kardashians, the--
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.800]   That's why you're here this week.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.600]   Because that's the topic of the week.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.200]   Oh, well, and also tech.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.680]   Oh, OK.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   But everything.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.040]   I mean, everything.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.360]   Who's on that show with you and how can we find it?
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.160]   My friend and co-host Ben Timmons is also on the show with me.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.880]   And you can find it on SoundCloud.com/NothingMatter'sCast.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.120]   And we also talk about, I mean, everything.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.000]   Reality, television, lots of politics, though, and lots of tech.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.240]   So if you're into those two things, then you'll probably
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.520]   find something good.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.360]   The Nihilists Podcast.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.520]   Yes.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.120]   Is that a millennial?
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.240]   There it is.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.160]   Look at that.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.840]   Nice emoji headline there.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.400]   You're very million.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.440]   Hey, let's talk emojis.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.600]   Also, here Mike Elgin.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.440]   He is our digital nomad who seems to not be nomadic these days.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.880]   Nope, not for a little while.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.680]   His website, Becoming Nomad, is all about the lifestyle.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.480]   That's right.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.880]   And I can't wait to adopt your lifestyle.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.240]   We would love to have you.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.520]   Well, I mean, while I just have to watch from a distance,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.000]   I'm kind of chained to this chair.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.960]   I mean, literally.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.720]   He takes it home with him every single night.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.560]   It's really kind of weird.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.120]   The car, the Tesla, the road, the chair.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.400]   Bring the chair.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.360]   We'd love to have you out there.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.160]   Drag it along.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.240]   It's scoot slowing.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.000]   Elgin.calgain.com.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.560]   That is correct.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.120]   So OK, we could start the show in two ways.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.800]   We could start by talking about the election this week.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.520]   Or we could start by talking about the new emojis this week.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.880]   Broccoli before chocolate.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.680]   Yeah, I'm all about ripping the bandaid off.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.040]   OK, let's do it.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040]   OK, let's rip the bandaid off.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.000]   And we'll just tell people, though, because I have to say,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.480]   I think I would bet almost all of us on whatever side of the aisle
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.520]   we are are kind of tired of this.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.560]   And we would like to take a break.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.960]   And I loved Garrison Keeler.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.520]   I quoted this when you were here on Wednesday on the twig to go out.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.280]   You know, what do you say?
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.640]   It was very funny.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.440]   Take some yoga classes.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.040]   Tense to oil, something like that.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.120]   Yeah, tend to our marigolds and relax a little bit.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.440]   But we will rip the bandaid off for this first segment.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.040]   So I reassure you, in fact, if you want to fast forward through the first segment,
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.880]   I wouldn't blame you.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.680]   But yet, I think we have to talk about a number of things,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.560]   including social media's impact on the election.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.640]   Yes.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.160]   And let's do this in a non-partisan manner.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.440]   One of the things that is kind of disheartening to me
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.120]   is all the blame that's being thrown around now by the losing side,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.760]   which happens, I guess, every four years.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.240]   And also the winning side, Adlina.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.800]   Yeah, there's a lot of blame.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.440]   There's a decline in civility, I think we're all seeing.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.840]   Maybe that's it.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.920]   But some of the blame rubbed off on Facebook.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.080]   And I actually have very mixed feelings about this.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.320]   Facebook, of course, is the source for most people,
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.840]   especially you young folks, you millennials.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.520]   Actually, I don't know.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.920]   Do young people use Facebook anymore?
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.440]   No, it's all such a--
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.240]   I have disabled my Facebook newsfeed
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.320]   for, I think, a year and a half now.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   I cannot read it.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.760]   So I cannot say you're a boring life.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.280]   Sorry.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.760]   I feel like young people are not using Facebook
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.480]   because mom and dad are on Facebook.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.680]   And so it's really more the middle-aged folks.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.040]   I don't know.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.680]   Is that true?
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.360]   I think that young people as in a generation younger
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.840]   than Alex and I are--
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.800]   College kids, let's say.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.960]   Yes.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.520]   Both Alex and I have aged out of the 18 to 25 demographics.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.360]   Sorry to say.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.240]   Even though I was recently asked what grade I was in high school.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.800]   Like two weeks ago.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.280]   Do the guy have a van and offer you some candy?
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.080]   No, thank God.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   OK.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.560]   Well, that was bad.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.080]   I have two kids in college.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.160]   And they both use Facebook a lot.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.600]   I mean, they actually are on Facebook.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.200]   And that's how I pretty much keep track
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.320]   of what's going on with them.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.080]   I do think, though, that the kids are really into Snapchat
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.000]   and Instagram.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   They use Snapchat and Instagram a lot, too.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.560]   I think almost nobody uses just one social network.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.360]   I think a lot of younger people use Facebook
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.440]   and also Snapchat.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.280]   Do the kids use Twitter?
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.880]   Yes.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   This kid does?
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.760]   Yeah, it's big in the West.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.680]   But importantly, it's big in the Midwest?
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.680]   Yes.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.920]   Oracard is big in Brazil.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.320]   That's in the Trump back.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.760]   Twitter's big in the Midwest.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.280]   Huge.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.480]   I have a Trump belt.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.000]   Yes.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.480]   That's what it is now.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.080]   It was the rest belt.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.200]   It's now the Trump belt.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.800]   There's a belt that includes--
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.480]   Now, see, that's not nonpartisan.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.000]   Let's say.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.280]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.280]   I broke the thing.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.200]   I apologize for it.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.160]   I restricted hashtag something.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.680]   I don't know.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.960]   Anyway.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.240]   Traction has to hashtag.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.640]   So the argument about Facebook is that Facebook
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.160]   became a conduit for fake news.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.520]   Fake news being trumped up stories--
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   Not intended.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.360]   Well, about either side, but mostly about Hillary Clinton
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.920]   saying things like, oh, she's already been indicted,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.000]   all sorts of stuff that was demonstrably not true.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.360]   And yet, because people get their news from Facebook
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.560]   and Reddit more than once over and over and over again
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.800]   on Facebook, it started to get the weight of truth.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.720]   And the accusation, which I'm not sure I buy,
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.080]   is that Facebook has some culpability for this,
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.960]   that they should have done something about this.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.160]   So that's a two-part point.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.000]   The first thing I'll say is for a lot of people,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.600]   Facebook is the internet.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.400]   It's where they start.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.600]   It's where they go from.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.360]   And so for many people, they presume
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.920]   that what they see there has some sort of vetting,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.080]   I think, behind it.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.520]   They don't look at it.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.200]   Do they think there's vetting?
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.480]   No, no, not vetting per se, but there is something there
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.600]   that gives it some credibility.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.960]   It is not from the blue.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.560]   It's not just some random website.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.360]   Exactly.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.400]   Except that it is.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.920]   In fact, it's Macedonian random websites.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.320]   Yes.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.400]   Random websites.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.520]   But, because they saw there's a lot of money to be made
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.880]   and clickbait, by the way, they're not partisan.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.480]   But then clickbait articles that they promote on Facebook
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.320]   that drive traffic to their sites, which have ads,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.160]   and they make money on this.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.480]   So I was reading an interview with a Macedonian 16-year-old
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.640]   who created a political site for this very reason.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.920]   Which will be brilliant if it doesn't
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.520]   bring down Western democracy.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.960]   But the reason why--
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.720]   I mean, that might my contention didn't.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:51.360]   And by the way, Zuckerberg's also contention is that's crazy.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.600]   But how could that--
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.400]   We'll get to Zuck.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   OK.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.160]   I wanted to get to Zuck.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.120]   I mean, he's had a couple of obnoxious things
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.920]   to say about all this.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.960]   The first of which is that it's crazy to say that Facebook
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.720]   swayed the election.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.640]   And then when people like me started tweeting,
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.280]   so you mean you're telling your advertisers that Facebook
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.800]   is not influential in any way?
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.760]   Exactly.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.840]   And so he backed off that and said, well, no, 99%
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.560]   of the news on Facebook is legitimate news.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.920]   So you're saying 1% of it is false, first of all,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.400]   second of all, you said you couldn't identify what's fake
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:23.960]   and what's real.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.360]   That's a very difficult problem.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.400]   So that's what you told me now.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:26.920]   Exactly.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.840]   Either you know what percentage is fake, or you can't tell.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.320]   It doesn't-- you can't have it both ways.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.240]   You either can't tell, or you know that 99% of it is real.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.680]   So he's scrambling.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.360]   Because he doesn't want--
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.120]   let's look at it this way.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.720]   If you want to blame Zuck, think of this as a business problem.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.040]   If he was losing 30 million users a month,
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.240]   his shareholders would say, you have to fix this.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.760]   And he wouldn't say, well, there's nothing we can do.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.160]   When it comes to making money, he never says, oh, we're not
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.880]   really doing anything about this.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.280]   Now, in fairness, he did say that he's
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.400]   going to do something about the fake news problem they're
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.840]   going to do as much as they can.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.760]   But wait a-- all right.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.560]   Well, no.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.400]   So here's the thing.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.280]   We can look back in terms of history
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.840]   when it comes to the way that Facebook has dealt
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.760]   with news before, which is that they have, as a platform,
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.720]   traditionally affected the way that news has been
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.560]   seen on the news feed.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.000]   Point blank, period.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.160]   There was a time in which when I was on Facebook,
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.360]   I could see nothing but up worthy posts.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.520]   I could see nothing but--
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.020]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.020]   --10--
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.800]   --and they fixed that.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.720]   --10 ways that'll blow your mind.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.200]   Mass potatoes better.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.560]   And we hated it, and they fixed it.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.480]   Yes, and they fixed it.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.760]   And so the issue that comes down to
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.440]   is if you've interfered in the way
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.640]   that news is presented before on your platform,
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.840]   what makes it-- what makes this different now?
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.280]   And what about this time?
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.080]   What about the way that this news or this non-news
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.040]   is being disseminated through your platform?
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.560]   What about it makes it an exception to the rule
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.800]   that you've already set for your space books?
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.640]   OK.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.720]   But I've been getting fake news on the internet
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.240]   since the internet began.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.440]   I've been getting foolish emails.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.000]   I've been seeing on every social medium up to this point
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.760]   stupidity.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   Why is fake--
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.200]   hey, why should Facebook be held responsible for how
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.960]   people use it?
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.520]   They use Facebook.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.160]   Facebook is a tool.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.720]   OK.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.040]   And I don't think Facebook needs to be any more responsible
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.920]   for the content than the phone covers.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.160]   That sounds reasonable until you realize two things.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.680]   The news feed algorithm that sorts and shows you stuff
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.800]   of its own volition is an editorial product.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.200]   And trending topics is also an editorial product.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.080]   Facebook has dumped--
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.640]   I agree with you.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.480]   They should dump trending.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.840]   I don't care about it if they're jumping or not.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.800]   But as long as they're going to be making editorial choices
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.680]   with what content they show, individual people,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.600]   especially in a political nature,
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   they're making a stand as a media company.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.640]   Just so everybody's clear on exactly what's happening,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.520]   Facebook is not showing you.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.240]   They're blocking.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.880]   They're preventing.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.360]   They're censoring.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.520]   Whatever you want to call it, something like 80 plus percent
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.240]   of what the people you follow post.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.760]   So many--
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.480]   On average, generally speaking.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.720]   So what is the criteria?
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.160]   What should it be the criteria?
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.080]   Right now, the criteria is whatever's viral.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.640]   Well, these false memes are designed to be viral.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.080]   So this is easy to fix.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.580]   OK.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.080]   I think so too.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.320]   Dump trending topics and make the news feed
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.240]   be most recent, which by the way, you
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.080]   can do it for yourself.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.200]   Temporally sorted.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.560]   Temporally sorted no algorithm.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.720]   What if Zuckerberg did that?
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.760]   Would everybody say, oh, that solves it?
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.720]   It makes less money.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.600]   It's a two steps forward, two steps back.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.880]   You know why it makes less money?
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.080]   Why?
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.440]   Because you don't enjoy it as much.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.760]   You don't spend as much time on the page.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.560]   It's not as sticky as it is.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.080]   I know that eating carbs is bad for me.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080]   The fries are delicious.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.560]   So all Facebook is doing is what it should do
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.160]   as its responsibility to its stakeholders,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.640]   which is maximizing profits by making
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.240]   you spend more time on the feed.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.720]   It's created a computer.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.600]   Computer is nonpartisan that doesn't have an opinion.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.760]   It's merely crafting the feed with one goal in mind.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.720]   You feed into the computer.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.240]   OK, your only job is to make somebody
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.360]   to stay on that page as long as possible.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.120]   OK, got it.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.640]   I'll take it from here.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.720]   I too am a capitalist.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   But I do think they have a higher, more responsibility
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.160]   to the people because they have 1.7--
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.200]   I think that way lies trouble.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.040]   Not at all.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:58.480]   Not at all.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.360]   Because essentially fact checking exists.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.920]   It's a tradition that's been around for decades.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.360]   Organizations are really good at it.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.040]   If you're a news organization--
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.200]   They are a news organization because--
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.480]   They're a social media site.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.760]   They are determining what we see and what we don't see.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.200]   Period.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   Edit sources.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.760]   Editing what's out there so that we see a minority
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.440]   of what is posed.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.440]   They're giving you more of what you want.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.680]   But here's the thing.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.320]   People don't know that out of this also.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.040]   Right, people don't want lies.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.480]   They think--
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.960]   When upworthy hurt them, they stopped it.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.840]   OK.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.520]   Well, no.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.760]   So up where they still exist and they still do the same thing
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.040]   that all that linking to link bait, clickbait articles
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.760]   made people dislike Facebook.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.200]   I remember.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.760]   It was like, ew.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.040]   And so they got rid of it.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.520]   I think that what it comes out to--
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.560]   That's not a political thing.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.240]   They just got rid of it because you didn't like it.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.360]   Make Trump unprofitable again.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.040]   Also, I think that--
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   Is that what you want?
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.240]   The problem with the evolution of moving it back
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.760]   to the most recent timeline feed
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.760]   is the fact that they censor that stuff
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.920]   and they limit that stuff because if you saw a raw feed
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.200]   of what everybody you were friends with posted
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.240]   or friends of friends posted on Facebook,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.240]   it would look like the most insane waterfall timeline.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.800]   You would choose to follow fewer people.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   No, like two years ago.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.560]   You would choose to follow fewer people.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.240]   No, I do that.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.160]   I always look at most recent.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.120]   It's on most recent--
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.280]   I look at both.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.520]   I look at the filtered and the--
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.680]   I wish I could make it--
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.520]   I wish it would remember that setting.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.840]   Guys, let's start talking about small points,
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.200]   talking about the impacts of this.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.640]   So my dad currently lives in Alabama of all places.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.560]   And he works down there.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.600]   And so we talk on the phone more often than I think most
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.120]   people do, but he was telling me about voters down there
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.960]   that he hangs out with.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.000]   And just people from the South, very kind of
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.040]   standard people down there.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.560]   And the things they actually believed
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.400]   were true about Clinton.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.560]   He brought this up unbidden, by the way.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.960]   I didn't bait him into this.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.400]   And he was like, I was really confused
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.880]   at what they thought was true, that they claimed
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.160]   they had read on the internet.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.480]   And he said it's from Facebook.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.320]   If I were about to--
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.680]   But I want to point out that people voting
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.560]   in geographic proximity have similar opinions.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.040]   Even if they never went online, you
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.720]   hear from your friends, you hear at the corner store,
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.880]   you hear from everybody, that's the story you hear, you buy it.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.920]   I respect that entirely.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.840]   What do you want to do?
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.920]   Do you want to have some sort of magic headphones that
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.560]   balance the information?
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.720]   No, you don't bounce it politically.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.400]   You have fact checkers, just like every news publication
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.760]   ever had-- We have fact checkers.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:18.920]   OK, but--
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.120]   I should Facebook.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.680]   Facebook needs to-- look, the things you see
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.520]   are based on criteria.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.640]   One of those criteria should be, is it
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.360]   patently false, or is it not patently false?
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.760]   Who's going to decide that by the way?
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.600]   The fact checkers.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.840]   And also technically, is there a agreement among the fact checkers?
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.120]   If there's a news story that says Donald Trump is Jack the Ripper--
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.640]   No, there's some.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.320]   --because that is small.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.360]   There's some legitimately wrong stuff.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.840]   But then there's a lot of stuff in the--
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.520]   OK, everything ranks.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.440]   This problem has been solved long ago.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.520]   You can rank things as the fact checking sites do,
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.960]   of which there are more than 100.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.640]   And most of them are really good.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.560]   Something is either more or less true.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.120]   It's factually true, or it's patently false.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.880]   The patently false stuff should get at least a ding against it,
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.320]   as if nobody clicked that way.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.080]   What do you see a big red thumbs down?
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.920]   What do you do?
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.520]   So what happens is actually users already
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.600]   can report false news.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.880]   It actually exists already within the Facebook UI.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.920]   There's a good solution.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.840]   It already exists.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.360]   It is about three layers deep.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.080]   I'll tell you that.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   So maybe if we--
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.680]   I don't like this, and then you have to say it's false,
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.440]   and then why is it false, and then you have to say it's a false news story.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.600]   It's the same abuse process for everything else.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.240]   It exists, but if you're going to have a reporting system,
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.160]   you can do two things.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.480]   One, you can make it not so buried in the UI
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.160]   to make it easy for people to report.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.320]   And two, you can follow up with it.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.960]   And if that's the case, you follow up.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.120]   And just like when people do DCMA takedowns,
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.120]   or when they do copyright takedowns, they can look at it,
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.280]   and they could say, OK, well, what is this?
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.240]   Is it true or false?
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.040]   And then they can adjust the algorithm accordingly.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.320]   That's kind of in a perfect world how the workflow should be.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.720]   But at the same time, I think the difficulty is--
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.000]   and you said this before, which is truthiness exists.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.400]   And there's always going to be a level of people who
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.960]   believe that certain things are true, certain things are false,
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.680]   and then certain people who also believe that Snopes is
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.640]   a liberal mind control organization.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   So--
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.140]   Dang.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.160]   Well, my question is--
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.040]   That according to Snopes.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.720]   Why are we having this discussion now?
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.680]   Had we won the election?
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.480]   Had we had the Democrats won the election?
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.080]   Would we be having this discussion?
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.560]   I would hope that we would still be having this discussion.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.320]   We didn't have this discussion before the election.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.160]   Well, who writes the script?
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:29.840]   It seems to me as if this is another one of those blame
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.360]   game things.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.160]   Oh, well, we lost so it's Facebook's fault.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.520]   Let's forget about the outcome of the election then.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.360]   I'm on Twitter a lot.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   I'm on social media a lot.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.200]   Should Twitter do the same thing?
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.360]   And you could never get an--
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.160]   I remember I've been around for a long time arguing online
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.760]   about politics for several elections now.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.960]   And this is the first election where
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.160]   you couldn't have an argument about policy or politics.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.680]   You'd start to have an argument.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.840]   And what was coming back at you was like,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.720]   you were trying to disprove weird things.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.200]   Like you never get to a political argument.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.560]   How about we teach people to have more critical judgment
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.160]   and to understand what's true and not true
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.240]   and do their own fact check?
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   I feel like putting the responsibility on Facebook
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.520]   to do this is completely the wrong thing to do.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.800]   No one is saying that Facebook has the responsibility
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.760]   to educate the American election.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   But all we're saying is if they're
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.840]   going to make editorial choices, like the newsfeed
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.960]   and trending topics, they should accept
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.720]   the full responsibility of that choice
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.560]   or do nothing that is editorial.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.040]   Yes.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.400]   We're pointing our point is they can't have their cake
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:26.920]   and eat it too.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   That's all we're trying to say.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.880]   I don't want Facebook to become the supreme arbiter
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.120]   of all things true because they'd be horrible at it.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.840]   But right now what they're doing is bad.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.480]   What Wikipedia does is you come across a page sometimes
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.960]   and it kind of tells you a lot of the information
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.840]   on this page may is coming under suspicion or whatever.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.800]   It gives you some doubt about it.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.320]   That's Wikipedia has by the way a fabulous system
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.480]   that seems to work quite well at aiming towards the truth.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.360]   There are obviously many inaccuracies
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.320]   and falsehoods on Wikipedia, but it seems to self-correct
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.520]   very well.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.120]   That's a non-profit site.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.880]   I mean, it's almost the antithesis of Facebook.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.000]   It also has some of the longest standing information wars
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.480]   that exist and it's by the power of the user.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.400]   As they should.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   So if, for example, Facebook allowed the intake
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.760]   and easier intake of false news reports
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.320]   and they were able to use that as a guideline
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.680]   in order to create a better system
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.320]   for how they manage the algorithm,
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.200]   especially when it's related to news,
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.240]   then it's exactly like what they were doing before,
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.200]   what they've always been doing.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.000]   And it's also in line with their policy.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.600]   The issue is they don't, Facebook doesn't want
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.840]   to appear political.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.120]   They can't afford it, but also take this one step further
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:45.960]   to put this in.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.640]   - Well, as they shouldn't, they shouldn't be partisan.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.440]   They should just be a conduit.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.600]   This is what bothers me.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.600]   - Well, then we'll talk about Twitter for a second.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.600]   - So let's talk about Twitter.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.440]   - Let's talk about Twitter.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.280]   Does Twitter a problem?
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.920]   - Well, let's take one specific fact.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.000]   The number of bots that were tweeting information
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.560]   about the election, right?
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.760]   They were seven to one, I believe it was.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.000]   Trump information, pro-Trump information
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.080]   for every one of Clinton information.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.840]   So is by doing nothing, is Twitter being neutral
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   or is by getting rid of all the bots, Twitter being neutral?
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.000]   What would neutrality look like for Twitter?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.960]   Right now they're favoring one side
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.480]   because one side is doing more of this particular
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.640]   specific activity.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.080]   So I'm saying, well, what does it,
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.080]   well, what should Twitter do?
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.880]   Let's say Twitter kill bots.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.040]   - No. - I mean.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.520]   There's a lot of really funny bots out there.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.920]   We're gonna make a joke in this for a second,
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.600]   but like, I can't talk about that bot
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.080]   on the Shooks' family friendly.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.440]   There are a bunch of humorous bots out there
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.640]   you can follow that are actually a lot of fun.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.200]   In fact, my friend is making a Twitter bot
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.800]   of all my tweets to make a thing about me.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.640]   It's kind of funny.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.800]   - I would submit that Twitter's biggest contribution
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.480]   was giving us an unedited, unexforgated feed
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.520]   to Donald Trump's mind.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.840]   That was, I mean, however you feel about him,
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.000]   that was a huge, valuable thing that Twitter did.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.320]   - I think Twitter's an incredible tool.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.080]   - By the way, he continues to use it.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.120]   - You have a whole, can I tell him what I saw
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.560]   on your tweet deck?
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.920]   - He has a real Donald Trump column in his tweet deck.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.760]   Of course I do. - Of course I do.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.560]   - Just Trump tweets. - He's the president elect.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.520]   - I know, but I never wanna know what he says.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.360]   - Not really.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.920]   - He said the New York Times is declining in circulation.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.360]   - They clap back, you see that?
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.200]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.360]   - Even though they're on the rise.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.040]   - Well, fine.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.200]   And you use some brains, and so as a result,
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.440]   you look at this with discrimination.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.680]   I wouldn't want an automated system doing that.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.920]   I think that that's my job.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.640]   - You also misspelled speech this morning.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.080]   - Well, do you want Twitter to go sick?
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.560]   Do you want Twitter to say, there's a typo on your own?
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.200]   - No, no one here is advocating
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.080]   that all of a sudden Twitter go through everyone's tweets.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.280]   One of my ones told them what they can,
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.120]   I cannot say.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.720]   All we're saying is a Facebook is gonna be a media company.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.040]   They need to act like a mature one.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.520]   - Is Twitter a media company?
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.080]   - Twitter? - Yes.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.920]   - Less so in this responsibility.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.760]   - So in this responsibility is Facebook.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.080]   - I would say less so in this sense than Facebook.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.880]   - This is the logical consistency what you guys are saying.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.480]   Because if you say this about Facebook,
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.840]   you have to apply it to Twitter.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.680]   - Yeah.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.520]   - And are you?
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.080]   - Well, some of them have branches of media,
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.360]   aspects of media that are involved directly on their platform.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.720]   Twitter curates news.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.360]   You can go to the beautiful little news lighting bolt,
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.840]   and you can see exactly what's going on.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.280]   - No, well, I agree on that on the moments page.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.360]   I agree. - Moments.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.200]   - Twitter has responsibility because they've decided,
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.680]   they've taken it upon themselves.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.280]   So this goes back to it actually an age old conversation
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.200]   on the internet that comes down
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.120]   the Telecommunications Act of 1996, actually of 1938.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.800]   Are you a common carrier like the phone company?
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.160]   The phone company has no responsibility
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.040]   for the content of phone calls because it's a common carrier.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.280]   - Under a title two. - Under a title two.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.640]   I would submit that social media is that,
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.320]   but I understand what you're saying is
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.120]   when they take on a larger role, is this slippery slope?
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.080]   And in fact, I think that's why I would advocate
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.080]   they take on no role, they stay a common carrier.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.320]   The minute they take on a role,
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.760]   then they have a higher responsibility.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.160]   - That's the entire crux of it right there.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.120]   - So when they're not a common carrier,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.120]   they're what's the opposite of media company?
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.800]   - Well, they're a hybrid tech media company,
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.320]   but they don't want to be called a media company
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.840]   because they have much lower revenue multiples
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.320]   than tech companies do.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.840]   So if you call Facebook and media companies,
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.680]   whatever they do, they want to say we're not a media counter.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.280]   - The big encounters care about that sort of thing.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.360]   - It's also wonderfully dovetails into the fact
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.200]   that all of this, especially in relation to the way
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.000]   that tech companies are seeing,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.320]   especially the internet as a common carrier,
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.640]   could be radically affected within the next four years.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.840]   - Are you talking about neutrality?
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.160]   - Oh my gosh. - Oh my gosh.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.240]   - Oh, net neutrality. - Tom, we were saying.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.200]   - All right, stop, because this is a second conversation
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   we can't have, which is what a Trump administration
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.160]   will look like to tech.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.720]   My reluctance to get into that is it's an unknown.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.160]   And we can say what he said in the campaign.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.680]   I think he's already backpedaling on some things.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.600]   In many cases, he said inconsistent things
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.720]   about a lot of things, H1B visas.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.560]   I'm not sure what his policy is
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.040]   'cause it's not written on his website
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.800]   and his public statements have been inconsistent.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.560]   I mean, the guy was a Democrat three years ago.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.560]   We don't really know what is gonna happen.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.600]   Of course, one hopes that the most misogynistic
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.640]   racist things that he said and encouraged were
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.600]   inappropriate rhetoric that he will abandon,
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.440]   but we don't know.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.360]   So what I'd like to do, and maybe that's wrong,
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.960]   but what I'd like to do is defer judgment
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.680]   until such time as he says what his policy is.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.960]   - I think that's reasonable, but given the people
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   that he's bringing into his--
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.040]   - Oh, it's a straight conversation.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.800]   - It just gets people ginned up over something
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.840]   that hasn't happened yet.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.920]   - Okay, but can we frame it like this then?
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.360]   Given that Trump is now the head of the GOP,
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.920]   he's their actual leader.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.240]   - Well, he's actually, I would argue with it.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.160]   - Paul Ryan.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.080]   - I don't know who the head of,
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.520]   I don't even know what the GOP is in.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.880]   - The standard GOP would just make you--
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.840]   - The standard bearer is--
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.000]   - He's the president elect.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.840]   - He wins.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.720]   - It's not a parliamentary system
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.480]   where the head of the party is now the prime minister.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.840]   - The nominee of the party is generally regarded
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.280]   as the head of the party.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.120]   - Yeah.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.400]   - And I think you're right, and I think this is a new era,
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.720]   and I don't know if we can say that.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.400]   - All I'm trying to say is, if we--
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.440]   - I think it's very likely that mainstream Republicans
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.480]   will reject what he does in office.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.160]   - That's a possibility, but I do think when he comes
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.400]   to policy things that have been on the books of GOP
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.200]   dictates for a long time, we can look to them
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.480]   as a preamble of what he may do.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.320]   - I think that's--
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.000]   - I don't think you can, I don't think you know.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.840]   - Kids, was I--
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.760]   - Was I-- - Was I too far?
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.680]   - No, I think that's too far.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.240]   I think it's a complete mystery.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.520]   I can guarantee you the Republican establishment is going.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.360]   - Okay, so--
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.200]   - But-- - Okay.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.360]   - What's he gonna do?
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   - Let me try it one more time.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.480]   There was a story that came out about two days ago
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.680]   reporting on the first meeting between technology
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.160]   and business leaders in the tech sector
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.400]   and the Trump transition team,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.000]   and they discussed how the approach policy
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   in the Trump administration,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.040]   is that close enough to be an accurate talk about?
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:57.880]   - Yeah, but that won't--
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.920]   - Okay. - No, because that's a discussion.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.040]   I would like to see actual actions,
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.880]   and then I believe me, I'll take to the streets.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.400]   I don't have a problem with protesting actual actions.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.240]   - Okay. - I have a little bit
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.080]   of a problem with protesting something
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.320]   that hasn't happened yet.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.080]   - I think Ajit Pai is probably next in line
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:14.920]   to be terminally FCC.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.800]   - That probably doesn't matter, we don't know.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.400]   Wait 'til that happens, will ya?
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.560]   - No, 'cause I wanna gear up now.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.400]   - Easy for you to say--
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.920]   - Yeah, not 59.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.760]   - You're gonna be on this show and that happens.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.600]   He might not--
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.440]   - But you're back in there.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.960]   - But you're saying you're giving yourself
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   an ulcer over something that might happen.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.360]   - Absolutely, and I will take an ulcer,
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.200]   I'll take it twice.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.640]   - Allow me to step into the batting cage for a minute.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.560]   Sorry, I'm gonna tag in here.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.840]   And I think that this is something that we can discuss,
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.920]   which is, are you ready?
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.760]   - Yes.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.760]   - Which is the idea.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.080]   - No. (laughs)
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:45.920]   - Let's stop it.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.200]   - So, Trump has gone on record to say
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.960]   that he opposes the FCC's Open Internet Order.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.360]   This is something that he said, but he just--
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.000]   - He said, okay, wait a minute.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.680]   He said it in a tweet.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.520]   - And he said it.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.200]   - In which he said it compared it to the equal,
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.120]   what was it, the FCC rule for equal media access.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.960]   Fairness doctrine.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.040]   - Yes, the fairness doctrine.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.880]   - That was in a tweet two years ago.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   I don't know if he still thinks that,
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.080]   if that's what he's gonna do.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.960]   And I think debating Donald Trump's tweet
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.720]   is an exercise in fertility.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.240]   - What I was going to say is,
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.000]   what I was going to say is, however,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.400]   he seems to also feel sympathetic towards net neutrality
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.960]   in the sense that his interpretation
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.320]   of the Open Internet Order was actually a knock
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.840]   against net neutrality.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.680]   - It's confusing. - I know.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.760]   - However, now-- - He's also said
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   he wants to end the Time Warner acquisition by AT&T.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.600]   - Yeah.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.480]   - So, what do we got?
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.320]   We don't know.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.440]   Let's wait and see.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.120]   I'll bet you.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.160]   Well, I'll bet you, but it doesn't,
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.080]   you can't debate something he might do.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.240]   That's, you can't.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.200]   There's nothing to debate.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.040]   Well, I mean, we can tell you--
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.520]   - I think it would be a good thing
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.000]   if he stopped AT&T Time Warner.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.400]   I think it would be a bad thing
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.760]   if he over-appointed somebody in the FCC
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.240]   who would overturn the net neutrality.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.680]   We can say that, but we don't know.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.520]   He hasn't done it yet.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.880]   - Let's talk about what has happened.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.840]   This is a complete shift,
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.160]   and I hope you don't mind about this.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.080]   In 2008, eight years ago,
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.600]   I wrote a column that flatly,
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.120]   I had come to the conclusion
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.040]   that social media determines elections.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.400]   At that time, President Obama's running for office,
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.840]   and I said, he's got more juice on social media.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.760]   He's going to win in who won.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.080]   And then every major election since then,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.360]   I've looked at the social media,
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.840]   number of followers, the amount of engagement, et cetera.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.880]   And in 100% of the cases in major elections,
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.800]   whoever has the most juice on social media wins.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.640]   - And clearly--
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.480]   - This one wasn't even close.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.320]   - Wasn't even close.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.880]   - This one, Donald Trump is--
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.720]   - Master of the media.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.320]   - A master of the media.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.120]   - And so here's the question,
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.000]   is the social media simply determined,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.240]   is success on social media how you get elected?
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.240]   - I think it's simplistic to say it's that thing
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.120]   or another thing.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.720]   You can also say he was very good
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.960]   at getting mainstream media to cover him
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.400]   because he was so good for ratings
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.720]   and they got billions of dollars in free television coverage.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.720]   You could also say, you could say a lot of things.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.560]   - reality TV.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.280]   - Yeah, I don't think we should oversimplify.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.440]   I'd see a lot of this.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.400]   Well, it's all Comey's fault or it's all Bernie's fault.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.240]   - Right.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.840]   - And you know what, it's a lot of things.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.880]   And I don't know if anybody will ever know what was the reason.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.200]   It could well be that Hillary Clinton was just not likable
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.480]   and it could well be that,
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.920]   well, we've had eight years of a Democrat,
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.960]   it's time for a Republican,
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.520]   which by the way happens with regularity.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.840]   I don't know what it is.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.400]   - But we can agree that CNN shouldn't have played
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.880]   so many Trump rallies in prime time,
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.720]   unencumbered by commercial.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.640]   - Certainly helped.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   - Him.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.480]   - Certainly helped.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.520]   And it helped them by the way.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.760]   And Les Moonves, chairman of CBS.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.360]   - No, but Zuckers said that they should have done that.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.160]   - So Zuckers only won contrition following the election was that.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.160]   And I think that's kind of a telling lock of self-awareness.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.880]   - Les Moonves, chairman of CBS says,
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.920]   "It may not be good for America,
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.960]   but it's damn good for CBS."
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.160]   - Actually buy some stock.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.080]   Can I sell my citizenship for stock?
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.280]   - So-- - Don CBS, please.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.360]   - Anyway, we're in a different media environment
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.480]   and it was the Sittifney network, right?
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.960]   Edward Armuro's Tiffany network.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.040]   You could trust CBS when Walter Cronkite said,
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.600]   "We're gonna lose Vietnam."
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.280]   That was it, Nixon, sorry, Johnson knew that he had,
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.120]   that he was no longer be able to take us to Vietnam,
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.920]   continue to be in Vietnam.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.240]   The New York Times used to be the paper of record.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.080]   - Still is.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.640]   - So by the way, there's on both sides
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.120]   some unhappiness with the--
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.440]   - Oh, no, sure.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.840]   - Yeah, yeah, that doesn't change the fact
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.680]   that there's still the best.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.280]   - Actually, you know who I think is rapidly taking the mantle
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.920]   New York Times is Jeff Bezos over at the Washington Post.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.920]   - Yes, he's taken--
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.240]   - I think it's very interesting.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.960]   Here's it, we talked about this on Wednesday,
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.760]   is this is the new model for journalism.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.720]   Journalism, you can't pay for itself.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.560]   - Right.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.040]   - So what you need is patronage.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:54.880]   - Sugar daddy.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.720]   - Sugar daddy.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.960]   - Yeah, patronage.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.440]   Call up your local feudal lord, kids,
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.280]   that's what I've said.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.680]   It's like the metachies, right?
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.520]   - Right, yeah.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.320]   - It's an assisting ceiling, we get the Washington Post.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.960]   - I'll take the Post over to the ceiling.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.520]   - Ah, take the ceiling over the Post.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.360]   - Well, I know.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.280]   - But I'm a Post subscriber now, I give my name scribe.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.120]   - Yeah, yeah, they're fantastic.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.680]   - I give them, I'm giving them 10 bucks a month.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.840]   - I read so much Post.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.680]   It's kind of incredible to me.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.520]   - More so than time ago.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.120]   - So they're still at a deficit though, right?
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.080]   I mean Bezos is losing, Jeff Bezos,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.200]   we should explain of course,
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.440]   the founder and chairman of Amazon bought the Washington Post
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.480]   for not much, a pittance, a couple hundred million dollars.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.560]   - 250.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.720]   - And has been I think running in a deficit ever since,
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.720]   but bought him a nice new headquarters,
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.760]   a new digital strategy,
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.720]   and has doubled down on things like coverage of the election.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.800]   - You want to reinvent how newspapers operate.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.120]   - With an aim to making money or just not to lose some.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.720]   - So Trump says that he's using the Post
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.320]   to save millions of Amazon's taxes.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.040]   - Oh, and by the way, that's another--
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.280]   - So that's another thing that Donald Trump said,
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.480]   which is that he is going to do
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.920]   an antitrust investigation into Amazon,
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.200]   and one thinks, oh now this is now Jeff Bezos,
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.280]   according to Recode, extending an olive branch to Donald Trump.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.600]   Meanwhile, the stock market thinks Amazon's in trouble
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.880]   because the new president.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.200]   - There was also a Easter egg in that.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.360]   - Real related question.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.920]   - He said, I for one.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.760]   - For one.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.160]   - He essentially said, I for one,
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.640]   welcome our new insect overlords.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.480]   - Did he say that really?
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.800]   - He didn't say the insect overlords probably
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.120]   started with I for one.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.600]   - Oh, okay, that is, that's a dog whistle.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.440]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.000]   - Holy cow.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.400]   - So, one of the interesting things,
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.600]   and I keep harping on this,
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.680]   and I don't think we've realized we impacted this yet,
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.960]   but Donald Trump as president is going to be,
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.080]   is going to have a massive reach
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.040]   and going to be able to totally bypass the media.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.480]   Here's what he's got.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.640]   So because of a bunch of machinations,
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.440]   you can read up on how this came about,
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.400]   he got the personal use in perpetuity
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.480]   of the entire GOP mailing list for email.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.920]   And I presume he addresses as well.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.680]   He built his own, which the GOP does not have access to,
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.360]   that is like the Donald Trump fan club or whatever.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.440]   He built his own Twitter following
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.480]   of the real Donald Trump,
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.920]   which is at what, 14 million or something like that.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.840]   It's a lot of people, and he inherits POTUS.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.800]   - Yeah, what I'm interested to see what he does.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.640]   - I believe he does.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.960]   - And I imagine,
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.520]   - He has reached his massive,
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.360]   - 14.9,
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.480]   what I am in the mans. - On the hands.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.320]   - Right, exactly.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.200]   Look, if he says it in the GOP debate,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.720]   I can bring it up.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.360]   - The great new meme though is Joe Biden.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.360]   Have you seen the Joe Biden meme?
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.120]   - I've seen the theater incredible.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.440]   - Joe Biden telling Obama,
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.880]   and then there's a picture of Obama with his face palming.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.000]   Joe Biden telling Obama,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.960]   yeah, I put little tiny toiletries in the,
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.520]   in the men's room just for his tiny hands.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.280]   - And Obama's like, Joe, why'd you do that?
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.560]   He knows he's got tiny hands.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.760]   - I wanted him to feel at home.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.440]   - But if he happens in the Biden meme,
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.280]   look it up, it's fun.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.120]   - It's fun.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.360]   I'll show a couple of them.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.160]   I am hoping that I'll be interested to see
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.160]   how Trump continues to use Twitter.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.240]   It makes sense that he would use the @POTUS.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.160]   Right now he's got a bifurcated Twitter feed.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.800]   The iPhone postings,
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.920]   it seems to be are from the campaign,
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.720]   now from the transition team.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.800]   And the Android postings,
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.720]   as Trump says, he used an iPhone
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.600]   until he got mad at Apple 'cause of San Bernardino.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.160]   Now he uses a Galaxy phone.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.600]   The Android postings are usually the most
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.840]   unhinged late night postings,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.600]   seem to be from the real Donald Trump.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.280]   Maybe he lets the transition team
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.240]   and the government take over @POTUS.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.120]   And I love the idea that we're seeing
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.200]   an unexpergated view of the president.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.560]   Isn't that direct drive?
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.920]   I mean, that's pretty exciting.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.760]   - Well, then we'd have to say that Twitter,
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.360]   let's make a huge callback.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.320]   We're gonna have to say that Twitter
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.200]   is going to be a media company then
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.080]   because that kind of acts as to the president,
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.600]   based on his initial,
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.360]   president-elect, based on his initial decisions,
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.160]   that's probably gonna be as close to a press corps
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   as we will get.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.160]   - Well, he's already dishing the normal press pool.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.000]   - Yes.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   - And so forth, which is a horrible press game.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.080]   - Once he did that once, it was an oversight.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:47.920]   We don't know.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.440]   We don't know what his policy is gonna be.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.360]   - Leo, did you leave your cynical bones at home today?
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.320]   - 'Cause this is like the weird,
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.160]   I'm not like cynical.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.280]   - I'm cynical, I'm cynical.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.240]   I'm cynical, the next guy.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.760]   But I think that for all of our sanity
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.160]   and for the future of the country going forward,
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.560]   and I know this is controversial,
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.000]   but it wouldn't be a bad idea to wait and see what he does
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.080]   because I do think that basing your opinion
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.520]   of somebody on his contradictory
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.040]   and frankly bizarre Twitter feed
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.840]   is not gonna make any sense at all.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.680]   - I agree with that entirely.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.040]   I'm looking more at the policies
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.800]   that the people around him that he's hiring
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   to run his administration have to discuss in the past.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.200]   - So far the people he's hired have not impressed me.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.280]   - Bannon doesn't impress you?
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.120]   - Not Bannon.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.040]   - If Bannon wanna impress you,
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.520]   what will we EPA transition guys not?
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.040]   - Climate change skeptic.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.960]   But so there are things to talk about that are real moves.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.800]   - Yeah.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.480]   - But I do think though that in the tech world
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.320]   it's not neutrality, the carried interest loophole
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.720]   and venture capital and that sort of thing spectrum options.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.960]   - Well, here's an example, H1B visas.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.240]   On the one hand, obviously he's anti-immigration.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.520]   Silicon Valley wants more H1B workers
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.560]   because they say they can't find enough skilled workers.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.960]   On the other hand, we've seen companies use third parties
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.920]   like WePro in India to hire unskilled workers
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.680]   at a very low rate.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:07.040]   Disney did this, a paulingly hired hundreds of unskilled workers,
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.920]   brought them in or moderately skilled workers,
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.040]   brought them in, had Disney's own IT guys train them
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.320]   and then fired the Disney employees
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.760]   and kept the invited employees.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.760]   That's a misuse of H1B and I do think
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.520]   the Trump has condemned that.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:26.640]   He's also suggested that the H1B minimum wage be raised
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.320]   so it's not a cheaper way to get staff, talent.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:37.440]   But at the same time, he's also got a pro-business stance.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.080]   I have no, I think this is unknown.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.920]   - Well, here's one perspective that I haven't heard expressed
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.520]   and I think it's a valuable one.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:49.520]   The way the US currently enforces
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:55.080]   and legislates immigration is people at the bottom
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.840]   of the economic ladder are unprotected by immigrants.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.680]   So people come flooding in by the millions
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.320]   to take lower-skill lower-wage jobs
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.320]   and lower-skill lower-wage Americans have to compete
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.800]   with those immigrants for those jobs.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.280]   Whereas in the white collar world,
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.760]   there's this ridiculously small cap, right?
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.440]   The H1B1 visa program.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.280]   - It's thought.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.560]   - The lawyers and the professionals in the college grads
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.720]   are protecting themselves from having to compete with immigrants.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.440]   - Well, and this is the other thing Trump has said is if people,
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.560]   I don't like seeing people come to our country,
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.040]   go to Harvard and Princeton, get this great training and leave,
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.240]   I want to keep them in the country.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240]   - Which makes perfect sense.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.640]   - Via the H1B visa program.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.640]   - I think the phrase is stupid.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.720]   - So I don't understand what his policy is, right?
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.800]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.040]   And that's why in some respect,
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.080]   I think it's a good idea to wait and see what he does.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.280]   'Cause he's got kind,
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.920]   he, you know, Apple, on the one hand, he tells Apple,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.720]   well, you know, from now on,
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.400]   if the FBI asks you to unencrypt,
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.240]   you're going to unencrypt it.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.880]   And by the way, time to start making all your stuff here
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.920]   in the United States.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.760]   On the other hand, he says,
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   "But we're going to let you take all those billions
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.240]   of dollars you have in Ireland.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.120]   We're going to let you repatriate that
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.200]   at an all by mere 10% tax rate,
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.040]   and we're going to cut the corporate tax rate."
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.320]   So did you, if you're Tim Cook, do you go,
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.600]   "Yeah, no, yeah, I mean, what do you do?"
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.320]   - Remember when he called for a boycott of Apple
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.240]   during one of his rallies?
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.240]   - I just got on about that.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.080]   Oh my gosh.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.840]   - And he himself changed from an iPhone to a Samsung galaxy.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.080]   - I wonder if he's kept that up after all the firmware.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.800]   - It's basically shorting his political policy, right?
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.640]   We're not going to know.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.480]   - We're going to do this political policy.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.800]   - Until we open the box and figure it out.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.280]   - In this case, though, the cat's dead in both cases.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.200]   - But we, but at the same time,
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.280]   like if you say two things and they're conflicting,
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.160]   can both of them meet your?
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.000]   - That's my point.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.840]   Or the rule of trans-mly.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.680]   - Or both faults.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.080]   - Pick the one that's worse and go with that one.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.520]   It is also possible that we'll see that continue
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.000]   for the next four years,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.240]   in which case it will be bloody chaos.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.040]   - It's like a 20-sided dice from D&D, like,
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.880]   and policy.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.000]   - Yeah, I just, I think this is,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.320]   we have never seen a situation where we know so little
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.440]   about what's going to happen on January 20th.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.960]   - That's why I have told my fellow youths out there,
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.000]   in particular, that this is now an opportunity
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.360]   to donate and volunteer for causes that are important to you.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.200]   - That's the best you can do,
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.120]   is if you have an opinion,
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.480]   continue to stand behind it
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.000]   and stand behind the organizations
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.600]   that represent your point of view.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.840]   And frankly, if you're a Trump supporter,
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.000]   and there's certain things that you thought
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.480]   were good about Trump's platform,
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.680]   you might wanna do the same thing,
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.120]   because I don't think there's a guarantee at all
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.720]   that he's gonna do any of the things he said he wanted to do.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.680]   - I think that that's a reasonable,
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.040]   it's not only a reasonable thing to assume,
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.720]   but it's also in support of your position
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.560]   that we should wait and see,
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.160]   because I don't think Trump feels bound
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.800]   by anything he said, I don't think he's--
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.640]   - No, that's--
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.480]   - Support or do you expect it?
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.320]   - By the way, that's clear.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.160]   When you have Giuliani, he said,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.040]   "Yeah, we're not gonna build the wall."
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:46.880]   - Yeah.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:47.720]   - That'd be ridiculous.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.640]   - That's clear.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.520]   Yeah, he said, that was a camp,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.800]   that was campaign rhetoric.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.400]   That's clear that everything's on the table.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.800]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.160]   - So I just don't,
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.880]   but so to get back to our conversation,
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.400]   social media clearly important.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.840]   I, you know, here's the problem,
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.800]   this is a conversation we have over and over again
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.280]   about everything, tech changes everything.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.120]   - Yes.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:07.960]   - And we're in a brave new world.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.800]   What is Facebook?
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.640]   Is it media?
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.480]   Is it a common carrier?
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.240]   No, it's both.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.320]   And what are the rules?
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   What should the rules be?
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.560]   And how should Facebook carry itself?
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.600]   And I don't think there's an easy obvious answer.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.720]   In fact, I'm arguing, by the way,
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.320]   as I always do, the devil's advocate,
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.520]   'cause I wanna,
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.760]   I think it's important that somebody stand up
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.080]   for Facebook's position that, well,
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.520]   that's not our job.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.200]   You're supposed to vet what you read on the internet
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.400]   because critical thinking.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.060]   - Yeah, but that's like magic,
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.060]   it picks you down.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.360]   - No, I think it's actually frankly insulting
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.200]   when somebody says,
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.920]   well, Facebook needs to tell people what's not true.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.240]   It's saying people are too stupid to figure it out for
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.280]   themselves, so it's up to Facebook to say yes or no.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.600]   Look at everybody who has email gets
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.280]   fallacious, bogus, stupid, wrong stuff in their email.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.760]   It's your job as a human being to not send
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.840]   a million dollars to a Nigerian prince.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.720]   - And Google filters that stuff out
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.720]   and puts it in the spam folder.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.720]   - 'Cause it's called spam.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.560]   - Spam, right.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.680]   - Spam, right, because it's false.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.120]   - So you're advocating for Facebook to build
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.480]   a spam filter for fake news.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.880]   - One thing that,
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.520]   here's a fact that changes the whole feeling
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.760]   about what Facebook is all about.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.640]   They're the most influential news organization
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.000]   in the history of mankind, by far.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.280]   - That does change everything.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.440]   - In the past, even moderately influential news
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.840]   organizations have a sense of responsibility.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.600]   In order to use the airwaves on TV,
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.680]   you have to have some responsible news.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.920]   Newspapers have always had a sense of responsibility.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.480]   Now we have this guy who's making
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.960]   billions and billions and billions,
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   or billions as Trump says,
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.240]   per quarter on being massively influential
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.640]   and possibly even determining the outcome of elections.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.480]   And they're like, hey, we're just like,
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.720]   we're just the hype through the--
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.040]   - They shouldn't be disingenuous.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.240]   And in fact, Facebook executives apparently have been
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.440]   saying the same thing, that we need to step up.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.080]   It's Zuck himself who's saying,
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.240]   "Hey, you can be crazy to think we've..."
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.080]   That is not the right tack.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.200]   The right tack is to say, "Yeah."
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.120]   And this is a difficult problem,
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.360]   and I don't know how to solve it.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.200]   - I would take that.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.080]   - They said, "Look, we hear you.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.840]   We see it. It's hard. We're working on it.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.680]   I'd be totally fine."
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.560]   - They did say that, actually.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.400]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.240]   - Made Zuck did?
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.080]   - He did.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.440]   - I've missed one of his comments.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.800]   - Yes, he said both things.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.960]   He said it's crazy to think that we determined,
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:25.800]   but we're working on it.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.720]   We know it's a huge problem.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.760]   It's a very difficult problem,
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.600]   and we're working on it.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.280]   We're trying to reduce the amount of falsehoods on Facebook.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.120]   But I think there's simply two things they need to do.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.000]   Number one, they need to look at the algorithm,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   and they need to de-viralify things that are obviously false.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.920]   I think that'd be a nice step.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.680]   Don't delete them.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.560]   Don't ban them like you ban other innocuous things,
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.960]   like women's breasts and stuff like that
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.080]   when they're breastfeeding.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.480]   But don't let them go so viral.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.160]   Take a couple of points off or something like that.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.000]   - Like prioritize them.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.240]   - Right, exactly.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   And I think the other thing they need to do
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.440]   is they need to work on this filter bubble problem.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.680]   I mean, there has to be some responsibility,
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.360]   because filter bubble is self-reinforcing.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.560]   The more inside the bubble you are,
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.040]   the more the stuff you see makes you more inside the bubble.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.720]   - I think forced busing is the solution
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.560]   of the filter bubble.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.120]   - Get people out of Alabama into South Dakota,
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.720]   and that would solve the problem.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.880]   - You're going for Alabama to South Dakota?
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.000]   - What did I just, we're going from Minneapolis to Tulsa.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.640]   It's gonna be fricking amazing.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.360]   - But we're all in a filter bubble by a virtual geography.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.200]   - Look what happened.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.760]   - We live in Northern California.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.120]   - Do you think I heard any pro-Trump rhetoric?
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.200]   - But look what used to happen.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.480]   - Let's compare Facebook to television.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.520]   In the old days, when TV used to go over the airwaves,
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.120]   the idea was that the American people
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.200]   own the American airwaves.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.360]   And therefore, we know you'd like to just do nothing,
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.680]   but have frivolous entertainment, news, channel, ABC, NBC,
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.520]   CBS.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.360]   - I do miss those days.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.360]   - But you have a responsibility,
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   because we're letting you use our airwaves.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.600]   And therefore you have to have some responsible news.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.040]   Let me finish this one point though.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.560]   And so Facebook comes along and says,
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.680]   well, we're gonna replace the TV stations,
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.840]   and we're gonna send all this stuff,
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.920]   but we're not gonna take any of that responsibility stuff.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.640]   We don't want anything that's gonna stop us
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.280]   from making massively billions of profits.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.880]   What they need to do is inject the other side
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.120]   into the filter bubble, even if people don't like it,
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.080]   even if it makes people spend less time online.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.080]   - I think that's up to people.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.440]   I followed every all 17 GOP candidates.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.240]   I followed all four Democratic candidates.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.320]   I followed all the independent candidates on Facebook,
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.480]   so that I would get all that content.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.280]   And I think that that's up to people
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.440]   who use Facebook to do that.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.320]   And I don't think it's Facebook's responsibility
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.520]   or anybody else's responsibility.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.760]   And I'll show you how we can highlight this issue.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.640]   So what if we had a public television station,
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.880]   a public radio station, and a public website
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.520]   that was legally bound to be non-biased,
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.120]   non-partisan, factual, and we offered this channel
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.320]   to the American people and said, look,
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.400]   here's the information you need to do this correctly.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.280]   What if we did that?
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.200]   - It's called the NewsHour.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.360]   - No, actually, you can find a lot of people
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.520]   who would disagree with that.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.840]   You're talking about the PBS NewsHour.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.160]   - Yeah, but people are disagree with that.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.240]   - People are going to disagree with facts.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.400]   - But that's why this is the problem.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.600]   Who's going to decide?
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.440]   Who's going to run that?
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.280]   Not the government.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.920]   Vote for me, I'll do it.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.440]   Who's going to run that?
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.160]   And immediately, if you name anybody, you introduce bias.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.880]   - Well, yes, we're a collection of human beings
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.000]   with individual thoughts.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.800]   We agree with each other and we disagree with each other.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.120]   So nothing's ever going to be--
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   - You're asking to fix people.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.080]   - No, we're asking them to act like a more mature media company.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.120]   I'm not asking them to grow wings and fly away.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.880]   - If they are going to become the public square,
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.480]   then they have to have some responsibility to the public.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.680]   I mean, look at Apple.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.080]   Apple, it doesn't even let you have,
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.680]   they changed the gun emoji into a squirt gun emoji.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.520]   - I know.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.400]   - Which, by the way, was a terrible idea.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.760]   - It was a terrible idea. - It was a terrible idea.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.840]   - But they, you know, all these companies,
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.240]   including Facebook, do a lot of censorship.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.320]   Look at all the censorship Facebook does
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.640]   for stupid reasons.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.080]   And we accept it.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.920]   How about a little censorship for good reasons?
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.320]   - I think it's attractable.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.160]   I don't know how Facebook,
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.040]   I don't know how you propose Facebook's office.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.240]   - Well, first you start with a public eye
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.480]   to guarantee you, no matter what they do,
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.360]   somebody's going to say, oh my God, that's biased
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.960]   and you're screwing it up.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.800]   - Yeah, I'm going to be-- - And if you're biased
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.200]   in favor of fact, instead of blatant falsehoods,
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.280]   then I think that's a good bias.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.320]   Why be neutral between the fire brigade and the fire?
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.120]   - Problem is the definition of fact.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.200]   - Facebook's gap that--
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.720]   - I think it's very, for instance, climate change.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.320]   Some people say that's a fact.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.080]   Some people say evolution is a fact.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.840]   Would you say that's factual?
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:44.920]   Or should Facebook kill a creationist post
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.600]   or an anti-climate chain post?
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.200]   Who says that's factual or not factual?
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.440]   - I think decided between manufactured fake news
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.000]   and real news versus--
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.200]   - Some stuff is obvious.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.720]   So you're saying there's some stuff we should do
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.600]   like a spam filter does, which is just delete
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.360]   the really obvious turds.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.040]   - I think baseline, the excuse,
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.520]   we are just a platform, probably needs to go away,
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.480]   because saying, oh, we're just a platform,
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.360]   we're just a place for people to go.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.200]   - I agree.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.360]   - We are a place, we're not a thing.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.880]   No, you're a thing.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.520]   You exist and you make decisions
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.280]   and you make decisions about what people see
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.360]   and about what people hear and about what people watch.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.320]   So knowing that, knowing that's the case, right?
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.520]   We need these, I mean, everybody,
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.840]   and I'm not just talking about Facebook,
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.560]   I'm not just talking about social media sites.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.800]   You can argue now that Netflix has a vested interest
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.560]   in what they do as they're not a platform anymore.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.040]   They create their own content.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.840]   You have these companies that are now pushing forward
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.920]   their own interests, whether that's their own content
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   and trolling their own media.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.640]   - What if I say, we didn't really land on the moon?
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.800]   We didn't land on the moon.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.360]   That's a conspiracy.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.880]   Should that be blocking Facebook?
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.880]   What if I say nine one was inside job
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.720]   of the federal government?
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.920]   Should that be blocking Facebook?
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.240]   - Not blocked. - Not blocked.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.360]   And this is just the way that I feel about it.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.480]   If Facebook is going to make a decision
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.640]   about how it treats the way that certain news is structured,
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.320]   the way that certain pictures are done,
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.800]   the way that if they already have rules in place,
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.240]   they either need to follow.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.280]   - Well, you see the problem with this
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.640]   with the napalm picture?
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.120]   - Yes, they tried to remove.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.720]   - They did remove it because it was a naked 12 year old.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.440]   - And people have a right to be upset with it,
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.200]   but at the end of the day, also,
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.640]   Facebook is allowed as a business to do that.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.360]   - They are allowed. - And then they are also allowed
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   to bring it back and say, sorry.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.480]   - I think what they try to do is avoid as many rules as possible
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:31.600]   because the more rules, this is just an intractable problem.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.480]   - The best thing to do would be to start educating people
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.240]   that everything you read on the internet is not true
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.080]   and start using your freaking brain.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.960]   - But the problem is they believe it
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.480]   'cause they want to believe it
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.200]   and there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.400]   - But there's a lot, I mean, so Facebook is a creative company
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   with a lot of really smart people.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.040]   They move from just thumbs up to,
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.160]   oh, you can express how you feel about it.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.880]   News stories can be labeled as such.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.600]   So the things like evolution,
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.320]   which is you can label it as,
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.520]   this is a point of contention between what I do.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:06.120]   - By the way, that would be very controversial.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.280]   - There was a, you see?
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.200]   That would be very controversial with some people.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.480]   - But you just label it as, it's a fact.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.320]   - If you take away rationality and science as basis for a fact,
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.760]   then all of a sudden I'm a pony.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.040]   - This is why you can't solve it.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.440]   - No, but we are not, we are trying to say
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.280]   that that's how we're going to solve.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.280]   - Here's another example, there's a story
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.160]   that circulated on Facebook that after Trump's election,
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.520]   a circular cloud appeared over Jerusalem
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.280]   and you could hear trumpets.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.880]   That circulated and hundreds of thousands of people
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.480]   shared that story because they thought
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.680]   he was ushering in biblical prophecy.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.040]   It didn't happen, it absolutely did not happen.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.760]   It's false. - So Facebook should not,
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.360]   should ding it a couple of points in its viral algorithm.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.560]   And it absolutely should do that.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.400]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.320]   I think a lot of people want to read that story
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.880]   and are going to celebrate that story.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.960]   - Well then you, maybe people tell her.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.960]   - Then what did they, what did they say?
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.400]   - They should be brought up in a fundamentalist,
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.320]   not fundamentalist, but quite conservative, yeah.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.800]   But I had to break my way out of it myself.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.640]   - But, but, but,
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.480]   - Well that's the point.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.320]   - No, but ask questions. - Ask questions.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.160]   - Ask questions. - Ask questions.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.640]   - Ask questions. - I mean,
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.120]   there are, people believe what they want to believe.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.440]   And so the best thing you can do is educate people,
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.680]   try to, try to give them other information.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.720]   It's a mechanical system like Facebook saying,
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.960]   it's going to end up being useless because it's going to say,
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.840]   well, evolution's a theory.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.720]   Most people agree, but some people don't,
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.320]   you're not going to get any because there is no,
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.360]   there are very few things that are facts.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.120]   And most of the things in the realm we're talking about
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.520]   of politics are opinion.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.280]   Now admittedly, there was,
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.880]   I don't think there was a circular cloud over Jerusalem.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.800]   But if somebody wants to believe that
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   and repost it to their friends,
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.520]   maybe that's an inspirational post.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.200]   And you know that that's not an aspirational.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.320]   - Just to just, just to just the spak down to the nub.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.520]   If Facebook is going to make media editorial decisions,
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.320]   they have responsibilities as a media company.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.760]   If they want to have the newsfeed filtered
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.240]   or the algorithm that they want to do,
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.080]   we're talking about these. - Here's the problem.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.520]   Our definitions are antiquated.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.680]   We have this binary definition of media company
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.880]   versus common carrier.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.640]   And that's antiquated.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.480]   - Right.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.320]   What you're trying to say is Facebook a Victrola
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.640]   or is it Telegram? - Right.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.080]   - It's like, it's Facebook. - It's like a new thing.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.040]   - Do we need a term for a hybrid player
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.160]   that wants to not take on most responsibility
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.520]   of the media company, like a platform plus?
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.560]   - That sounds awful.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.400]   I would, okay.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.800]   - I made it up on the spot, Elhoc.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.920]   - It's a super, it's a super platform.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.760]   - Super.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   - I can come up with a million examples
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.400]   that would be incredibly challenging to Facebook
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.880]   once it put itself in this position of arbiter.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.560]   Let's talk about homeopathic medicine.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.920]   Many people believe in homeopathy.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:45.760]   I don't happen to.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.320]   I think it's scientifically bizarre.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.960]   - Bizarre is Facebook?
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.520]   Okay, but supposed to block and ban all homeopathy?
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.440]   - It's also an opinion, right?
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.040]   And at the same time, for example,
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   if you put the tools in the hands of your users,
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.960]   and then you are able to intake that data to understand
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.880]   and also grade that, like I said,
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.560]   they already can't afford false news.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.080]   - And then every faith-based religious post,
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.480]   your example's gonna have that.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.560]   But your example's gonna apply.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.400]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.960]   - Your examples are off because we're talking about news.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.920]   And if somebody says, oh, this homeopathic cure,
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.520]   cured leprosy, worldwide, okay?
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.320]   That's not a question about whether homeopathy
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.440]   is something you can believe or not.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.840]   That's a specific claim.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.960]   And news articles tend to contain specific claims.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.960]   And so it's not about whether--
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.200]   - It's not impossible to write an algorithm that says,
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   'cause it's gotta be algorithmic.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.320]   There's too many posts on Facebook not to.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.440]   It's possibly to create an algorithm that says,
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.080]   okay, that is an assertion of fact
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.640]   that's demonstrably true or not true.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.200]   We're going to check that.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.120]   I don't know how they do that,
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.600]   but we're gonna check that.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.840]   And then we're going to put a little green check
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.360]   if it's demonstrably true on red X, if it's not.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.280]   That's the kind of thing you're adding.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:07.120]   - My dream is, if you can imagine a NASA-like control room
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.600]   with big screens and all these nerds
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.360]   sitting behind terminals, right?
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.560]   And when something starts going viral, they check it.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.680]   Just wait till it's, you know, it's--
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.160]   - I don't even think it needs that.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.560]   - I think it needs-- - Not a full-time editorial stuff.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.320]   Sorry, I don't even think it needs that,
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.320]   because again, if you're able to put it
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.240]   in your new suite, if you feel like there should be
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.960]   due diligence reporting from your users, for example,
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.800]   if a news story comes up onto my Facebook feed
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.320]   that says DNA from Zodiac Killer Victim
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.640]   found to be Ted Cruz's, I would be like,
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.840]   okay, Ted Cruz is not the Zodiac Killer.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.160]   - I totally, I wanna post this thing.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.000]   - But is he not?
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:39.840]   - If I wanna post--
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.680]   - This is fake news, and then they get it,
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.120]   and it says, oh, look it, there's a report on fake news.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.080]   Wow, Ted Cruz, not the Zodiac Killer.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.160]   Pretty sure about that.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.200]   - Let's keep, let's, I wanna post a post
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.240]   has a picture of Jesus on a piece of toast
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.640]   and say I had a worst headache,
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:58.000]   and then I ate this toast and I feel better.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:58.840]   Fake news?
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:53:59.880]   - No, that's true.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.040]   If that happened to you, that's true.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.400]   If you don't-- - Well, that's what I say happened,
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.440]   I don't know, maybe it didn't happen.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.320]   Maybe I didn't have a picture.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.720]   - I think that's fine.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.880]   Maybe I photoshopped a piece of toast with Jesus.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.120]   I think it wouldn't be that hard to take news content.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.240]   - Where do you draw the line?
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.040]   I'm just saying, this is a face,
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:14.880]   this is where I-- - Factual effects.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.480]   - Stuff I like, not even stuff should happen.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.560]   I just like the idea of a piece of toast
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.560]   and clearing my headache.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.440]   So I post it, isn't that what Facebook's for?
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.160]   - Leo, hard doesn't mean not worthwhile.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.280]   - I'm not saying it's hard, I'm saying it's impossible.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.520]   - I'm saying it's hard.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.840]   Maybe it's doing that's our real difference right there.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.760]   - I'm saying the minute you do that,
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.600]   they already have.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.000]   - If the algorithm, the news feed,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.920]   and they don't try to do it in a benign fashion.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.520]   Just give you more stuff, you're interested in it.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.680]   - But I mean-- - And you're not benign.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.600]   - In your defense though, Leo,
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.720]   in the world of fact checking,
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.400]   which is a fascinating world,
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.520]   the best fact checking publication in the world,
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.240]   I think, is The New Yorker.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.480]   - Their factors are legendary. - They do a very good job.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.000]   - But they have an advantage though.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.560]   - The liberal rag, they have an advantage though.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.760]   They can't go in, they go line by line,
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.680]   every single claim, they say, is this true?
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.160]   And if it isn't true, they don't throw out the article,
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.960]   which is what Facebook would do.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.560]   They would re-say it and they would tweak it
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.600]   so that they don't actually make a patently false claim.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.240]   Facebook can't edit.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.560]   - I've asked a couple of recent New Yorker writers
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.880]   they don't do that so much.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.720]   - Oh they don't.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:15.560]   (laughing)
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.880]   - Just why they just kill you though.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.480]   - You said really it was the best.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.800]   Can we believe that nothing anymore is nothing sick?
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.960]   - Yeah, I think they've let many of the fact checker goes.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:25.320]   - Is that a fact? - Is that true?
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.280]   - I may be wrong, I don't know if you should check that fact.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.120]   - You should check the fact exactly.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.240]   - I may have made that up.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.520]   I don't remember.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.240]   - We're really sorry for today's Twitter.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.720]   - I seem to remember that.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.280]   Well that's another problem.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:37.480]   I think it's a fact,
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.880]   'cause I remember that conversation,
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:43.000]   but I couldn't, don't quote me.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.240]   (laughing)
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.160]   - Isn't that, but isn't life full of that thing?
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.840]   We have this notion that,
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.120]   oh no, no, no, it's very black and white.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.360]   The problem is what I believe and what you believe,
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.240]   if they're different, we may think different facts.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.920]   - And we haven't even mentioned the S-word satire.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   And then there's satire.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.760]   - Oh man.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.760]   - Borrelet's report?
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.200]   - Borrelet's report is not satire.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.720]   - So Borrelet's report gets re-Facebook
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.960]   or whatever you call it all the time.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.840]   And I would guarantee you that half the people will read it,
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.720]   think it's true.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.240]   - Yeah, I mean he's still looking for a joke.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.520]   - It's a humor column.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:14.360]   You don't like him?
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.560]   - It was actually probably the best burn
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.400]   of the entire show so far.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.240]   So far it's a fine chance to learn.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.160]   - You do not like Andy Borrewitz?
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.440]   - No one does.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.480]   He's hysterical.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.520]   - No, it's horrible.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.360]   - Wasn't that man real?
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.200]   - No, he had a 40s question.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.480]   - Is this like how your generation thinks
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.600]   Marmaduke is funny?
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.440]   - Absolutely.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.280]   - Oh.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.120]   - We're gonna make our own Twit with young people.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.200]   - Where do you go, Jans?
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.120]   - On the family circus question.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.560]   (laughing)
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.320]   We're gonna take a break on that.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.200]   You don't think Andy Borrewitz is funny?
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.040]   (laughing)
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.520]   - That's like, oh man, Leo.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.720]   - This is so funny.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.400]   - Marmaduke's kind of funny.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.400]   - Oh man.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.840]   - Are you?
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.120]   Do you read Andy Cap?
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.440]   Our show today.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.400]   - That's what they brought to you by.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.920]   - You know what, that was when I knew I was old,
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.600]   was when I started reading the comics page
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:01.400]   in the newspaper and didn't get a single laugh out of it.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.240]   - Yeah.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.080]   - Wow.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:03.920]   - Right?
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.880]   Do they still have comics pages in your newspapers?
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.720]   - Yes.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:08.320]   - Do you still have a newspaper?
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.720]   - Only when I go home to see my parents.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.960]   - Yeah, that's what I thought.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.000]   I mean, the Times doesn't have a comic page.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.600]   Does Monica have a comic page?
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.440]   - I have no idea.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.280]   - I don't know either.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.280]   - On Sundays.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.240]   - On Sundays.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.000]   All right, they're saying that you and I are,
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:23.840]   those old guys.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.680]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.160]   - The statler and Waldorf from Muppets.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.720]   - You think Marmaduke is funny?
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.560]   I don't know.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.400]   (laughing)
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.080]   - I really don't remember whether Marmaduke is a fan of that.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.480]   - Well, then that's the beauty of it.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.320]   - That's the beauty of it.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.160]   You don't remember.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.000]   - I can remember when things are funny.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:37.840]   - I don't remember.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.680]   - 'Cause they're not funny.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.600]   - There was a dog.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.440]   - There was a dog.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.280]   - It was huge.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.080]   - And it was situations were funny.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:44.920]   - Yeah.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:45.760]   - Funny things would happen.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.600]   - Big dogs are usually funny.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.600]   - Yeah.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.920]   (laughing)
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:50.920]   - That's a great show.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.640]   - I showed you they brought to you by go to meeting.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.680]   Why don't you take a break everybody?
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.880]   Just cool off relax a little bit.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.320]   We'll talk about emojis.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.160]   - I'm chill.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.880]   - What do you think of the beard?
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.160]   I like it.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.720]   We're brought to you today by go to meeting,
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:07.920]   why just phone conference when you can high tech it?
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.080]   Better meeting start with go to meeting HD video.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:13.280]   Means you're gonna see the people you're talking to.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.120]   We don't.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.720]   A lot of times we're gonna have a meeting,
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.640]   it's just a phone call, right?
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.760]   It's a conference call.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.080]   And we used go to meeting as our conference bridge
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.640]   because yeah, you can have the phone call
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:25.240]   and by the way you could do it over wifi on your iPad.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.720]   I mean, it's more than just phones.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.040]   It could be regular phones too.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.880]   But then like you're in the conversation,
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.640]   she's like, hey, I think I should show you
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.080]   this graph I have here.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.000]   And you just instant screen sharing.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.200]   You know, I'd like to see your face.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.320]   You sound like a pretty nice guy.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.320]   Now HD video.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.080]   It can take that conference call,
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.840]   make it something engaging, something special.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:46.920]   And you know what?
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.880]   Your client is gonna love you because it's so easy.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.800]   You send them an email invitation.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:53.600]   They click a link 30 seconds later.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.720]   They even if they've never used this software before,
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.520]   suddenly you're on the same page.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.280]   You're hearing each other, seeing each other,
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.160]   sharing the page together.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.320]   Crystal clear HD video.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.880]   Everybody stays on point focused and on task.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.960]   It changes the word meaning.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.800]   They shouldn't use the word meaning.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.960]   Because it's so much more than the meaning.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.120]   Nine out of 10 go to meeting users agree
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.960]   they closed deals more than 20% faster.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.520]   'Cause it's like being in face to face, frankly.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.920]   Don't phone it and go to meeting.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.280]   Start your free 30 day trial today.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.000]   Go to meeting.com, click on the button that says
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:26.840]   "try it free."
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.960]   Go to meeting.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.200]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:36.160]   You know, I blame Twitter for the whole time saying.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.200]   - Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.320]   - I do.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.640]   Twitter has coarsened our national discourse.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.960]   - That strikes me as incorrect.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.000]   - What?
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.560]   - 'Cause think about 56 years ago,
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.960]   people were just openly racist walking around the streets.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.200]   Now they're openly racist to the world.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.160]   - Yeah, but much less than more targeted.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.000]   It's different.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.080]   I mean, those people are even color-y on Twitter themselves.
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.040]   I mean, I've gotten fights at the alt-right too.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.640]   - Oh, well that should fix everything.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.480]   - No, it doesn't.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.320]   I try to avoid them.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.160]   They're quite stupid.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.640]   - I'm just saying.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:10.320]   It's a megaphone for every bit of garbage.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.640]   - Oh my point is it's less people being as nasty.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.080]   I do agree to sample-fi.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.480]   I think our side has improved a little bit since then.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.560]   - And Twitter's always said,
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.960]   well, they amplify as the good as well.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.000]   I feel like the bad is outweighed the good at this point.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.880]   I mean, how many times can you point to the Arab Spring
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.120]   and Hurricane Katrina?
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.640]   - So, #NeverTweet?
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.480]   You heard it here first.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.560]   - Oh, I stopped tweeting.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.400]   You know what I did?
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.120]   I did a passive aggressive thing.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.120]   I put a bot on my Twitter feed.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.760]   (laughing)
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.640]   - Good thinking, Leo.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.040]   It's totally passive aggressive.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.960]   It's like, it tweets, it tweets five times a day,
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.400]   but it tweets, you know,
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.480]   Leo's started a show.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.880]   Leo's published a show.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.000]   You really, you should.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.360]   - It's worse, it's a third person.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.200]   - Exactly.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.600]   That's where Hilder Clinton went wrong.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.440]   She had a whole third party tweet.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.680]   - Yeah, and whereas Trump is like,
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.440]   I think- - So maybe I'll rewrite the bot to say.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.880]   - Yeah, I. - Hi.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.800]   Friend.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.120]   - I've just published a show.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.800]   - Dash-L-L.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:04.640]   - Dash-L-L?
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.480]   - Yeah, I think.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.840]   - Yeah, that was a little note from you.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.680]   - First line is it.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.200]   - Yeah, and that, not like your handle already says
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.040]   the same thing. - Connect with your fan base.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.800]   - No, but it's not like my people posting.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.760]   - My dad still signs texts dad.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.120]   Like, I don't know what's him.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.720]   - I got a text to their friend who's like,
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.280]   if you saw it, then he signed it with his name too.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.240]   - I gotta change my settings here in Textrick
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.640]   'cause I have it in his sign name.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.240]   - Yeah, signatures on text.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.680]   - You know why I do that?
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.280]   I have a reason your dad doesn't have.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.400]   I use so many different phones.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.240]   Nobody knows who's, you've even said that.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.160]   Who's this?
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.640]   So now I sign everything so people know who it is.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.480]   - Yeah.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.680]   - I mean, who it is, it's just dad.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.320]   What is the thing you test me at four o'clock
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.080]   in the morning again, I'm gonna get very confused.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.760]   - What is it the thing you kids say
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.240]   when you get a text from somebody that acts like they know you
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   but you don't recognize a phone?
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.400]   - New phone, who this?
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.960]   - You say new phone, who this?
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.960]   - Say, oh!
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.480]   - Say, I knew that by the way,
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.480]   'cause I get that all the time.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480]   - You get new phone, who this?
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.480]   - You get new phone, who this?
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.280]   - You get a children's table for this show.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.760]   - I think we're at it, you're just the one about it.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.400]   - Just set up, just take all of our microphones
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.800]   and put them on a little Fisher Price picnic bench.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.640]   - I have to give Twitter credit though
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.400]   for catch phrase generation.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.400]   - It's the best.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.240]   - It's amazing.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.280]   - It's the best.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.720]   - New phone, who this?
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.720]   - I love Twitter.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.200]   - I love Twitter too and I think--
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.520]   - Hey, Twitter!
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.040]   - Well, but you wouldn't,
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.160]   under an Elgin administration you would love Twitter
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.360]   because basically all the,
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.560]   I think they should have pseudonymity.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.240]   So you have to be a real person to Twitter
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.520]   but then you can have a fake handle and they know it's you.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.040]   But you can't, the problem with Twitter
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.200]   is you can just crank out these new accounts
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.560]   every five seconds, right?
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.080]   And they shut them down eventually maybe
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.640]   and then you can just create 10 more.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.080]   I don't know how many people are argued with
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.840]   or I'm arguing with them about the election
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.040]   and then I look at, and then like they have zero followers.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.200]   - Why does anybody get an argument on Twitter?
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.040]   Are they eggs?
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:52.880]   - Same?
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.200]   - Are they eggs or an anime after?
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.360]   - Can't win an argument on Twitter.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.280]   Actually I do it.
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.120]   - It still hurts.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.520]   - I mean people still say,
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.480]   no I still have a small fracture to my soul left
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.720]   and people will come after me and say,
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.880]   really just nasty mean things that are factually false
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.720]   that I can disprove.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.240]   And so I fall in the hole and say that's wrong
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.960]   and then they change tack and make something else like,
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.160]   85 tweets later I'm like,
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.080]   I'm not a beta male guys, come on.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.760]   How's that working for you?
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.600]   - Are you doing with this one?
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.960]   - Next thing you know you got a beard like Leo,
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.360]   you're sitting there taking all hours of the night.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.760]   - I know and so my point is even though I know
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.200]   better I still fall out on this trap.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.200]   I think and B Master said it on chat a second ago
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.000]   that trolls are probably the minority of Twitter.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:28.840]   - Oh yeah, it doesn't matter.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.600]   - They're the majority of the account.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.600]   - I agree but I'm saying that we could all do better
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.600]   on our own end as well.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.720]   We talked about responsibility here.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.200]   I could not engage more but my ego is too fragile
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.040]   to let me not.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.640]   - In the great words of Katie Natopoulos,
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.280]   it's like wrestling with a pig,
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.360]   you get dirty and the pig enjoys it.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.680]   - That was actually not Katie.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.000]   That's kind of like one of the older quotes in the
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.960]   - No, no, no, no, that's gonna be Mark Twain, right?
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.760]   - Don't put lipstick on a pig.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.160]   - 'Cause then it'll kiss you.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.000]   - What is it?
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   It's like putting lipstick on a pig.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.920]   Or no, it's like teaching a pig to sing.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.920]   - It has something to do with a pig.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.880]   - Can we stop with the poor sign analogies?
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.080]   - That must have been a family circus joke.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.600]   - Yeah, a little one.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.440]   - I googled it.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.720]   - One circle of not funny.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.280]   - Never, and I think it is George Bernard Shaw, I think.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.120]   No, I can't be.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:10.960]   - No, it's Katie Natopoulos.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.680]   - Never try, wait a minute.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.600]   Never try to teach a pig to sing.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.400]   It wastes your time and it annoys the pig.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.680]   That's a similar quote.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.520]   - Yeah.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.840]   - The pig wrestling one implies the pig actually has fun.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:21.680]   - Yeah.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.840]   - Which is true.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.680]   - I think I thought that really.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.520]   - Yeah, actually, oh wait, Katie gets credit
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.360]   because George Bernard Shaw said,
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.600]   I learned long ago never to wrestle with a pig.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.320]   You get dirty and besides the pig likes it.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.160]   - She said it.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.480]   - George Bernard Shaw.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.880]   - Also known as, for both of you.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.600]   - Yeah, well, she quoted it in a piece about the time
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.520]   that she was in a Twitter fight
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.120]   with the lead singer from Blues Traveler.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.560]   - Oh, that was an amazing experience.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.400]   - That's an amazing, if you have not looked that up.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.480]   - Oh no, it's actually quite exciting.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.320]   - It's very good.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.240]   - Were they fighting over a harmonica?
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.280]   - No, I believe that she,
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.080]   I can't remember what it was,
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.640]   but I believe that she said John Popper
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.640]   from Blues Traveler was fat and sad.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.240]   And it got, it was an amazing Twitter fight
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:08.120]   that actually ended up in his book
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.640]   where he gave her like a backhanded,
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.040]   like some rude journalist sort of made this.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.240]   And she was like, I was making it show.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.400]   - This is my point exactly,
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.360]   is that this woman was able to post something on a site
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:24.560]   that John Popper saw and heard his feelings.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.960]   - Got into a Blues Traveler book, I know.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.600]   - I mean, that's just wrong.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.360]   So far I'd mind you today is breaking,
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.160]   now it's, he's breaking up this Twitter.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.120]   - This is so sad.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.920]   - This is his post today in the Sunday New York Times.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.400]   And he says the same thing everybody says,
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.920]   which is Twitter's totally addictive,
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.440]   but it feels like an addiction.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.800]   It's, it's, it's habit forming.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.960]   So the thrill of Twitter this year
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.480]   was visceral and habit forming.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.560]   It was a show that never stopped the fireworks display.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.360]   It couldn't keep your eyes off,
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.120]   even as it grew dangerously bright and transfixing,
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.920]   then set the whole town on fire
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.660]   and invited floods and locusts and plagues too.
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.600]   And is that factually true though?
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.200]   - No.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.440]   Boom, X.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.800]   - Yeah, check that out.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.280]   - Last 24 hours, you've been on 82%
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.720]   of your phone battery usage was Twitter.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.560]   - In the last six days.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.400]   - Last six days.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.240]   - That's low.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.440]   - The next number two, the number two app.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.240]   Spotify coming in at 4%.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.080]   - Yeah.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.400]   - Now, is that cause Twitter uses more battery
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.680]   or cause you live on Twitter?
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.960]   - I wake up to Twitter, I go to bed to Twitter,
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.760]   I tweet when you're not talking, I read,
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.560]   I mean, Twitter is my constant news feed
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.560]   of everything in the world.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.840]   - I actually recently boosted my productivity
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.640]   and writing massively by spending to leave.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.840]   - Five hours a day, five hours a day from noon to 5 p.m.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.000]   No Twitter, I don't want myself to do this.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:45.840]   - That's super smart.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.680]   - That's super smart.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.800]   - And just, Steve Kovac, we know and love.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.600]   Business Insider, Twitter is toxic.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.640]   I can't stand it anymore.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.120]   I started regularly deleting my tweets this summer
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.840]   and unfollowed everyone and started over.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.440]   See, there's the problem, started over.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.280]   - No, no.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.600]   - He didn't leave, he just, there's a better way.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.680]   - Oh, what a reference I've done this.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.520]   - Ryan's started it.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.000]   - That's making me sad.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.400]   It's driving me nuts and making me sad, I agree, Steve.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.120]   The secret is you have two Twitter accounts at least.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.200]   I have five, we've gone into this before and under this.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.600]   - I see you wrote a whole article on this.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.760]   - And I started to set it up and then I just threw it.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.600]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.400]   But at least two, have one for incoming tweets
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.960]   and have another one for networking,
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.080]   following your friends and colleagues
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:23.920]   and that sort of thing.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.840]   And that's very powerful.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.560]   - I had two in college, I had my main account
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.080]   that I had at Alex's drunk,
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.360]   but I would use about 8 PM on, it was fantastic.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.920]   - That's what Donald should do.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.760]   - Yeah, I know that.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.080]   - Because most of his Android tweets are late night.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.120]   - He doesn't drink.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.280]   - Oh, well, then there's no--
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.600]   - He should, he should start.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.080]   - That's fine.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.840]   - I actually spent less time on Twitter,
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.120]   probably because I left the journalism game.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.520]   Maybe that's why.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.960]   - But I think-- - Well, that's what Farhad says.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.280]   It's the tech journalists, the media,
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.600]   the Silicon Valley types, that's what it's using.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.680]   - We're the pigeons of Twitter,
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.080]   we're there like at all hours, we're always there.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.840]   I think that the important thing that I've found,
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.600]   especially when it comes to stating opinions
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.880]   that might be controversial or disagreeed by some,
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.280]   is that I say what I want and then I log off.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.680]   I go take a walk.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.520]   - What?
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.320]   - I enjoy my favorite beverage.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.120]   Maybe I might play a video game.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.240]   And then if somebody says something substantive to me
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.680]   that I believe is worth responding to,
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.840]   I'll amplify it and do so otherwise.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.560]   But you know, like the usual go make a sandwich
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.160]   or whatever, I just--
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.920]   - You're talking crazy, Lauren.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.760]   - I know.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.600]   - That's just crazy.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.880]   - I mean, I respect your work to life
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.000]   or your Twitter life balance.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   I just, I feel like I would miss out on something.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.560]   - You know what I think is interesting?
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.840]   - Is that I think most people would agree
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.000]   that if you stopped looking at Twitter and Facebook,
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.520]   your life would generally be better.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.760]   But we can't do it.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.680]   - You may not agree.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.640]   - No, I would disagree in a personal sense
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.920]   because I get to read across the spectrum
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.840]   politically around the world.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.360]   I get to read economic news from Brazil.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.480]   I get to hear about Russian banks, Chinese real estate.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.720]   I mean, the things that I care about
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.560]   are constantly pulsing in different times of the day.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.760]   So when I go to bed to Twitter, it's different Twitter
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.600]   than I get in the morning.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.440]   - No, that's true.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.800]   The other thing to keep in mind is that Twitter is simply,
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.560]   your experience of Twitter is whoever you follow.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.080]   And so I'm very particular about who I follow.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.400]   I follow some brilliant people.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.640]   There's some people on Twitter that make me laugh
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.240]   that inform me of things.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.800]   I have all the breaking news sites.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.280]   And so I absolutely love it.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.240]   But if you just follow people willy-nilly,
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.280]   if I actually followed my Gellgen account, forget it.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.120]   That would be crazy.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.520]   But the secret account that I have
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.360]   that I actually follow is fantastic.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.040]   If you wanna, let's say for example, as an extreme version,
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.600]   let's say the best Twitter account in the world
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.880]   would be who Pimaa, maybe, so Andreessen.
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.720]   - Oh, Mark, yeah, sure.
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:41.560]   - Yeah, Mark Andreessen.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.280]   - Who has, by the way, stopped tweeting.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.400]   - He always gets in trouble though.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.760]   He tweets until it talks about India.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.520]   But there's a perfect example of, well,
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.640]   he stopped tweeting.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.480]   - Farhead Monju was great on Twitter too.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.320]   He's great follow as well.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.240]   - He stopped tweeting.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.800]   - Yeah, well anyway, imagine if you could--
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800]   - Don't encourage them, Leo.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.960]   This is all I have left in life.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.480]   - By the way, on SID, if you watch "16 Minutes Tonight,"
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.920]   President-elect Trump is gonna be on it.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.200]   And you know what he's gonna say?
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.200]   - I love Twitter.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.760]   He actually talks about Twitter on "60 Minutes Tonight."
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.680]   - Their stock is up.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.520]   - Leslie Stahl says, "Are you gonna be tweeting
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.800]   "and whatever you're upset about,
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.800]   "just put out there when you're president?"
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.520]   Trump said, "It's a modern form of communication
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.560]   "between Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.400]   "I have 28 million people, 28 million people.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.800]   "So you're gonna keep it up?"
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.680]   As Stahl, it's a great form of communication.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.160]   Trump said, "Now, do I say I'll give it up entirely
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.000]   "and throw it out?
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:29.920]   "That's a tremendous form.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.840]   "I'm picking it up now.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.880]   "I think I pick it up, pick up yesterday.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.120]   "100,000 people."
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.920]   I'm not saying I love it.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.760]   This is like what everybody does.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.480]   - Hearing you read his actual words in order is painful.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.560]   - I know, it's very hard to read
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.880]   'cause it's syntactically torture.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.640]   - I'm picking up now.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.840]   - I think I pick up yesterday, 100,000 people.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.680]   - I know.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.960]   - If I turn that in, I would have fired.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.800]   - I know.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.680]   I'm not saying I love it, but it does get the word out.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.520]   He loves it.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.960]   I think in theory, it's great that a president tweets.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.880]   It's a fireside chat that never ends.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.720]   - Right.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.560]   - A dumpster fireside chat that--
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.400]   - Is it direct?
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.040]   - For our whole nation is the dumpster.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:01.880]   - Hey, you know what?
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.720]   Whatever, it's a direct channel into the person.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.960]   And frankly, if it turns out a president is corrupt
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.520]   or stupid or venal or racist or bad, we'll know.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.960]   It's a lot easier than the Imperial presidency
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.320]   where previous presidents have hidden behind
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.480]   their press secretary and we don't know what they think.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.280]   Dick Nixon was sitting in the White House
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.360]   swearing at black people, swearing at hippies,
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.040]   saying horrific things we know now 'cause of the tapes,
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.240]   but you wouldn't have known it then
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.560]   'cause of New York Times doesn't say Dick Nixon hates black people.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.760]   - Well, no, they weren't there.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.440]   I mean, so, oh, your point is access.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.840]   We now can see it in unmediated--
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.760]   - The downside is our enemies can also see it
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.720]   and be like, this guy's crazy, quick, launch the nukes.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.120]   - The difference is that Dick Nixon had a filter
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.920]   where his president Trump may not have such a filter.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.160]   - Which is why I'm glad he uses Twitter
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.360]   and I hope I pray he does continue to use Twitter.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.040]   And that his people do not take away his phone again.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.480]   'Cause that was so boring for like three days.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.080]   - Like America goes to war, he's like, America,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.960]   we're going to war, it's gonna be the greatest war ever.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:02.800]   - Yes, yes!
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.640]   - It's just, right?
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.040]   - Isolent explosion, it was--
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.920]   - But then you'll know, but then you'll know.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.320]   - Fourth of July, everyone you'll know,
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.880]   you say I saw people on the rooftops,
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.160]   the Muslim's on rooftops weeping, weeping.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.560]   Anyway, I'm sorry, I lost my head.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.560]   I do as a journalist use Twitter and Facebook
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.480]   in a different way because it's part of my beat check.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.400]   So every news person has, you know,
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.080]   they go through news sources in the morning
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.600]   and I actually do it in four or five times a day.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.680]   And it is a good source.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.400]   If you follow the right people-- - For crowdsourcing.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.320]   - Yeah, and an article that everybody's reading,
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.160]   you'll see that.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.640]   But you know, Jonathan Abrams was on a week ago,
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.640]   creative nuzzle, that's kind of what nuzzle is designed to do,
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.280]   is to skim through your Twitter and Facebook accounts
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.240]   and give you the stories your friends are talking about.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.160]   In a way, this is a more efficient way.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.160]   - Yeah, I was going to say that,
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.120]   I don't know if Twitter exactly does anything
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.320]   in terms of news curation that are really well curated
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.400]   and built for a sex scene. - But isn't that where you follow?
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.720]   - Well, the thing is, for me,
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.320]   I don't necessarily go to Twitter for news
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.400]   unless it's breaking.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.480]   I look at it to see what the conversation is.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.800]   I look at it to see how people are discussing news
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.120]   rather than the news itself.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.440]   If I'm learning, unless it's an immediate breaking news story,
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.680]   if it's news of the day, I'm probably getting it off
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.080]   of an RSS reader, I'm probably getting it off of the sites
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.280]   that I frequent.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.160]   It's part of my natural news gathering experience.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.240]   As Alex knows, him and his house of tabs that he lives in,
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.160]   you just have so many tabs open, you read and you refresh.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.640]   And that's part of the news gathering game.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.760]   I think that Twitter's real thing is the conversation.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.040]   So if you want to separate the two,
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.720]   I mean, Nuzzle's a great way to do so, I will say.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.040]   - The only downside of Nuzzle,
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.560]   and I know he's a friend of yours and a guest on the show
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.680]   sometimes, but you have to have a lot of followers
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.520]   for it to really work.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.080]   I mean, you have a ton of followers.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.160]   If you only have like 500 followers,
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.880]   it's based on your followers.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.720]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:58.640]   So it's problematic for people who have fewer followers.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.000]   - Also, if you read your feed at all compulsively,
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.040]   by the time you get to your Nuzzle,
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.520]   it's so far out of date, you're kind of laughing.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.040]   Like that's so 47 minutes ago.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:06.880]   - That's a good point.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.760]   - 47 minutes is a long time of the internet.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.040]   - But I do think there's also a generational difference
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.240]   how people use Twitter,
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.000]   'cause I don't, the conversation to me on Twitter
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   is exactly what I don't wanna see.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:18.840]   - Really?
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.000]   - Yeah, that's the stuff that's kind of throw away.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.600]   But I think you young people,
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.960]   that's you live for that back and forth, right?
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.000]   That messaging, Snapchat.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.440]   But because it's so awesomely,
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.360]   I mean, I have friends around the world,
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.480]   and when they're NSF, we meet from the internet
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.400]   into the real world, I mean,
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   so it's really expanded my network of humans.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.360]   In a way that could never have happened
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.920]   with pen pals and telegrams.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.840]   And so now I feel like I had access to everyone.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.160]   - Yes, 'cause when I was a child,
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.520]   pen pals and telegrams,
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.600]   you actually founded the Pony Express, little did you know.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.120]   - No, but I mean, so to me, it enriches my life in ways--
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.480]   - I have telegram pal.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.160]   - Once Old Man Leo was on shaking his cane,
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.960]   the children, I'll finish my point.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.000]   - I'll go ahead.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.200]   - My life is richer and I'm smarter for it,
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.680]   and I know it's a lot of work and messy, but--
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.920]   - Well, that's debatable, but I could be a lot dumber.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.760]   Watch out.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.160]   - That's true, I don't know what the baseline is.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.000]   - Oh.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.640]   - I also think that Twitter is a great--
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.040]   - Look in the mirror and find out.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:11.880]   - Oh.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.680]   (laughing)
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.400]   - And this is why you watch Twitter, right?
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.480]   For this kind of back--
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.480]   - It's what we do all day.
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.680]   - Yeah, it's what I hate.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.520]   - You're brilliant, by the way.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.600]   - I read Twitter and that's the other problem is,
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.080]   it's a language that you guys speak.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.760]   I read it, I think I'm having a stroke.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.720]   It's like, I don't, what are they, what is going on?
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.640]   What are they saying?
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.480]   I don't understand.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.280]   - I'll be your interpreter for a quarter million a year.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.040]   - No, you know, 'cause it's like, okay,
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.000]   you know what, it's really like license plates.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.160]   So you're driving behind somebody and it says,
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.440]   for you to be alert.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.520]   And I go, okay, I'm thinking, what is that?
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.760]   - And then you're crashing into a car.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.200]   - And then you're crashing into a car.
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.040]   Twitter's just like that.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.480]   It's like a bunch of license plates
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.600]   that you have to decipher every tweet, right?
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.800]   Or your mind just goes, oh, I understand what they're saying.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:58.640]   I understand what they're saying.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.560]   - I mean, I personally use it as a way,
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.600]   what I was going to say is there are,
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.080]   if you wanna bring it into a news context, for example,
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.800]   there are a lot of great reporters who tweet
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.560]   who often tweet extra color into their stories
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.800]   who often tweet about the process of news gathering.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.320]   They tweet about their conversations,
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.480]   sometimes they'll tweet about something that's coming up
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.800]   and they're like, watch out, there's gonna be something new.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.160]   And I really like that aspect of it.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.880]   - Here is, by the way, new Twitter account transition 2017.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.880]   The transition team has a Twitter account.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.080]   - Sure, I think that's run by his 11 year old son.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.600]   - You know what, he's great with a cyber.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.600]   - No, hey, hey, hey, hey, we're not doing baron jokes.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.880]   - We're not doing baron jokes.
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.720]   No, you're right.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.400]   - Kids are off limits.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.920]   - Kids and wives off limits.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.760]   - Spouses.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.880]   - Spouses of any kind.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.720]   - Agreed.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.240]   - Yeah, could be any gender.
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.080]   - And dogs.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.200]   - Why are spouses off limits?
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.480]   Because we're nice people, 'cause poor Melania
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.160]   did not sign up for this.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.760]   Maybe she did, I don't know.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.000]   - Dogs also, they're nice to dogs, they tell the truth.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.200]   - Dogs, same thing, let's not, you know.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.000]   But I do find this encouraging.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.280]   I would like to see many Twitter accounts
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.120]   from the White House.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.560]   I think that's a valuable,
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.080]   look, maybe they don't give press conferences,
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.200]   but they do this, that's not so bad.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.960]   - Stop down, but I'll take it as a consider to a question.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.360]   - It's better than nothing.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.280]   Most things are.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:24.960]   Especially if it's like un, you know,
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.960]   finished, unmediated.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.440]   - Very unmediated.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.960]   It was the word I was looking for, but it didn't work.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.040]   - I find myself often thinking about
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.280]   what would happen if Twitter no longer existed.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.160]   And I think that this is often coming up,
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.840]   especially given the word of turmoil.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.680]   - It might not.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.520]   - Yeah.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.360]   - And Twitter is especially--
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.200]   - Well, that's one of the things that happened
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.320]   is that Alex Bane, who was a--
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.160]   - Adam Bane.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.680]   - Adam Bane, who's a beloved figure at Twitter,
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.120]   the COO has announced his departure.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.280]   Do we know, do you know, was he pushed out?
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.720]   - Oh no, definitely not pushed out.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.560]   - He left.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.880]   - He made a choice.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.040]   - Why did he leave?
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.160]   - I think six years in that really messy companies
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.840]   a long time, if you're leading the torch
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.640]   as the person who brings order to chaos.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.800]   - I also think he doesn't see a glorious future.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.320]   He was there for the glorious part of Twitter.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.680]   - He was, I think, kind of touted as the next CEO,
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.040]   then Jack Dorsey got it.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:14.880]   - Yeah, but John--
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:15.720]   - He probably found out that was never gonna happen.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.920]   - It might have something to do with it,
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.240]   although that was months ago.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.520]   - I will say every time I've interacted with Adam Bane
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.440]   in any capacity, he's been exactly as nice
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.280]   as everyone says he is.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.120]   - Yeah, sickening.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.800]   - Which to me is so insane.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.840]   That means he scales niceness by hand.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.680]   - Yeah.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.760]   - That's just, I hate that.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.560]   I know, I'm not nearly good enough for us to do that.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.240]   - So, I know, I'm never nice to you.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.000]   So, I'm wondering if he's announced,
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.680]   he hasn't announced what he's gonna do.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.760]   - No, he said that he's going to pursue other projects,
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.360]   but it's not quite exactly sure
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.200]   how that's going to be true.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.240]   - So that's the-- - One, venture capital.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.080]   - Yeah, probably.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.640]   - Bane capital.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.240]   - At the same time though, when you see somebody
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.320]   who is kind of-- - That's a good name.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.160]   Isn't that great?
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.320]   Trademark. - Never heard of it.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.080]   But when you see somebody who is basically
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.320]   their presence as an executive is part and parcel
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.280]   of the company or the platform at large,
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.800]   I mean, this is like if, you know,
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.880]   Cheryl Sandberg left Facebook, everybody be like,
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.200]   "Why does she leave?
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200]   What's going on?"
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.240]   You know, because she is such a well respected
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.880]   and beloved executive there,
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.800]   that people would start to panic.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.800]   And I think that the omens are kind of all there, right?
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:22.240]   You have the shutdown of Vine.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.680]   You have the reports of sales talks
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.560]   not going through, you have Adam Bain leaving,
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.920]   you have, you know, there are these small signs that say,
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.120]   like, okay, well, what's the future here?
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.440]   - So what if it goes out of business?
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.440]   What if we have no Twitter?
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.880]   - It's not gonna go out of business.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.440]   - Well, no, but I think Lauren posted a positive
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.440]   and interesting hypothetical.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.280]   - She's totally correct.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.320]   - What would we do without Twitter?
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.280]   I would be happy.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.640]   I would do a little happy dance.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.760]   - That would be sad.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.560]   I'd go to be school and just get into banking.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.800]   - Sorry. (laughs)
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.400]   - No, technology in finance wouldn't be fun for me
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.240]   without really that bad.
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.760]   I would go back to Google+ and Salk.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.880]   - Yeah, you'd be alone.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.720]   - Party of one?
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:01.560]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.240]   - You'd be too much, you'd just steal my jokes like that.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.680]   (laughs)
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.920]   - No, party of one is a better state, but better way to say.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.600]   - Let me have a second longer to get to them.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.200]   - In time, you will learn.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.280]   - I'm here to learn from the quasi master.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.360]   - No, no, no.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.880]   - The quasi master?
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.040]   Come on, that was that was do.
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:17.880]   - All right.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:22.480]   - I don't know, I feel like the flowers would bloom,
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.400]   the sun would come out, the clouds would lift
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:28.160]   and it would be a happy time for all of America.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.000]   It would make America great again.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:30.840]   (laughs)
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.680]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.840]   - I wonder, I don't think that Twitter,
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:38.080]   I think that Twitter as a company has a large chance
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.280]   of not being as the company as it is today.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.680]   - It's never going away.
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.640]   - I don't think that Twitter as a technology
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.240]   will never go away, so understanding that,
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.720]   I think that there's a lot of really interesting opportunities
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.040]   in the fact that if you divorce Twitter the technology
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.360]   from Twitter the business,
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.640]   what does this method of communication become?
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.720]   Does it still exist?
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.320]   And if so, how?
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.160]   - It became apparent very early on in Twitter
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.000]   that in fact we sometimes called it the dial tone
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.280]   of the internet, that it was in the same sense
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.880]   that the dial tone is the carrier
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.040]   that allows phone conversations possible.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.920]   Twitter was a necessary feature of the internet,
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:18.600]   a real time dial tone that people could use to converse over.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.040]   So yeah, maybe Twitter would open source the software,
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.000]   they would give it away, maybe some benevolent company,
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.760]   maybe Jeff Bezos would just buy the technology
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.600]   and let it run.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.840]   Would Twitter be better without management?
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:35.400]   - So this is, again, I think that at the crossroads
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.000]   of politics this is something that we have a conversation
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.080]   about a lot, right?
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.560]   Would businesses be better without regulation
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.320]   if there's somebody overseeing it?
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.760]   Or will it end up breaking down in a way
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:49.680]   or becoming a disadvantageous in a way to continue?
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.280]   - You don't need to improve Twitter, Twitter is done.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.360]   Well, you need--
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.760]   - No, there's no edit, until there's an edit button.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.600]   Excuse me, a Twitter.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.200]   - There's an edit button so I can edit my tweets.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.480]   - No, without ruined Twitter.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.320]   - That would ruin Twitter.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.160]   - Without ruined Twitter.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.160]   - You're stuck.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.000]   - Nope.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.080]   - You're stuck, what you wrote and you can delete a tweet,
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.360]   but you know what, doesn't matter.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.640]   - I want a four minute window.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.960]   Give me a four minute window to edit my tweets
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.280]   and then maybe-- - And you know what that is?
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.280]   - No, but you know what that is?
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.440]   That's hovering your finger over the,
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.600]   pause the send button for four minutes.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.240]   - Sometimes I have 10 votes. - Once it's sent,
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.840]   no, but the problem is, the minute it's sent,
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.000]   it's appearing all over the place.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.880]   Even if you deleted or edited it, you can't take it back.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.080]   - I just believe that there's always an opportunity
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.160]   for a more perfect Twitter.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.000]   - I don't think so.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.840]   - I think so.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:31.680]   - Yes.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.520]   - What are you?
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.360]   - I think it for sense.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.640]   In fact, I think we strip out moments.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.320]   We strip out a lot of the croft.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.160]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.000]   - Right?
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:39.840]   - Ooh, cruff.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.600]   - And we just make Twitter be what it's so good at,
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.360]   which is that stream of real stuff.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.280]   - Here's the irony.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:46.280]   The reason nobody wants to buy it is they're losing
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.040]   too much money, and the reason they're losing too much money
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.440]   is they added all that crap.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.280]   - No.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.560]   - They used to run this.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.840]   This company used to run with like 250 employees
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:55.680]   or something like that.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.280]   I mean, really, for all you did was make sure
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:02.600]   that the servers were up, that the software worked.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.040]   - And keep improving and tweaking.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:04.880]   - No.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.400]   - Just a basic functionality, but no algorithms.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.240]   - No, you've got the,
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.080]   you've done enough.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.760]   You've got the @reply, you've got the hashtag.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.800]   - I think that'd be great.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.480]   - You've got, I think take out DMs.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.320]   - What?
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.160]   - No?
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.000]   All right, leave DMs.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:16.880]   - What am I gonna slide into?
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.720]   I think DMs.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.200]   (laughing)
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.360]   - It's a Twitter joke.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.880]   Again, can you explain that?
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.720]   Is that what you--
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.560]   - Oh, Hawk, do you wanna do us one?
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.380]   - Is that what you say?
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.840]   The kids, they say, let's slide into DM.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.800]   - You know back in the day when you were say
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:31.560]   at the Speakeasy or the Old Timey Saloon,
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:36.160]   and you'd see a fine maiden instead of a patty coat.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.840]   - And you see fine-mated in several patty coats,
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.560]   and you think, wow, I like the cut of her jib.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:42.480]   Instead of walking over and asking to buy her a drink,
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.400]   you slide into her DMs and say, what are you doing?
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.880]   - Or like, wait a minute, people do that?
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.200]   Twitter, like you're sitting there,
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.440]   and she's over there, how do you first of all--
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.280]   - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.120]   not in the same room.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:53.960]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.800]   this is a general concept.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.720]   - Instead of, instead of walking up and buying some--
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.280]   - Well she has to be following you already.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.120]   - Yeah.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.040]   - Oh yeah, okay.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:01.880]   So you do kinda--
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:05.120]   - Twitter is also the world's biggest dating app, by the way.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:05.960]   So.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.280]   - Alex has gotten like 80% of his most recent relationships
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.120]   up Twitter.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.480]   - Well, one for one, the last ones, there you go.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.880]   So anyway, so okay, we keep at reporting.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.080]   (laughing)
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.800]   I open up Lauren's like, hey, Alex is personal life,
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:16.640]   here we go.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.080]   We don't change anything, we just take out moments,
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.600]   we take out the video stuff, we take out the ads,
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.160]   we take out, you leave trending topics?
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.080]   - Well, I guess it depends on how many people
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:27.920]   are going to be running it.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.080]   - Take it out, take it out, it's toxic.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.800]   - Strip it down in the metal, and also you should be able,
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.200]   if somebody replies to your tweet
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.640]   with an @reply, you should be able to delete their reply.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.480]   - I agree.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:39.320]   - What?
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.160]   - Yes, that's--
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.000]   - No.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.680]   - Every other social network allows you to do that.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.040]   - But Twitter is curating your--
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.840]   - I know, but the democratization of responses
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.120]   is what makes Twitter so much fun.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.920]   - No, it's what makes it such a great place for trolls.
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.000]   - Right, I know, but that means--
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.320]   - Controls can go do their own feed,
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.080]   they can't hijack my feed, that's all I'm saying.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.080]   They can't hijack my--
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:55.920]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.000]   - That may be good, but it strikes my censorship buttons
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.280]   in the wrong way, I'll think about it more.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.280]   - Yeah, but periodically my feed gets loaded
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.520]   with all sorts of crap from one person, by the way.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.960]   Because he tweets like a thousand times,
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.680]   and I would just like to be able to say,
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.240]   don't put that stuff in my--
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.600]   - Well, that's the new button, but by the way,
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.480]   before we move on, what's your secret Twitter handle?
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:14.640]   - My secret Twitter handle, what is it?
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.240]   - The new news, really? - Yeah.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.080]   - Okay, thanks.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.000]   - Well, now it's not a secret anymore,
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.280]   man, you just blew your own cover.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.320]   - I was, I was going for it, but it worked way too easily,
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.400]   so I was not having a secret.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.720]   - Yeah, so that would be an example
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.800]   of you would like to not have Alex tweet the new news, right?
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:28.640]   - I can try that out, you can't--
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.280]   - All right, go for it.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.320]   - The new news.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.320]   - MacBook sales, we talked last week,
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.760]   everybody was very upset and depressed
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.640]   about where Apple went with the MacBook Pro,
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.440]   where they're going with their Pro line.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.160]   Jason Calacanis basically said, "It's over for Apple."
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:49.320]   And yet sales, according to Phil Schiller,
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.320]   are already passing last year's MacBook.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.840]   Not that that is a benchmark,
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.000]   'cause the MacBook was a specialized product.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.520]   - It didn't sell that well, and didn't sell that well.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.320]   - So maybe that number is kind of Apple's way of saying,
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.320]   "Well, we're like some smoke and mirrors, we're selling."
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.800]   - It's an Amazon kind of like comparative metric,
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.440]   like we sold 30% more candles this year than last year,
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.800]   which is always very annoying by them.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.520]   But in this case, Apple is generally good
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.680]   about telling us hard numbers.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.320]   - You can't buy it yet in the stores,
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.640]   and I think this is the week you're gonna be able to,
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.440]   this is actually where it'll be telling.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.280]   The people who order it site unseen are Apple fans
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:29.720]   who either that or they've had a MacBook so long,
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:33.280]   the MacBook Pro so long, like I have since 2012,
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.680]   whatever it is, I have to have the new one.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.760]   But that's a limited market.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.280]   When sits in stores, then you have people actually trying,
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.240]   they touch bar, and you have people actually trying
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.920]   the new keyboard, and that's when sales
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.560]   will be an important indicator, how it doesn't store.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.240]   And that's gonna happen this weekend.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.280]   - So the question is, is the novelty good,
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.000]   or is the novelty not good?
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.080]   - And I don't think you know until you've used it for a while.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.040]   - No, absolutely not.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.440]   I mean, to put it in dorky gaming terms,
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.440]   it's the difference between the we and the we you.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:06.440]   Is the novelty universal, or is the novelty niche specific?
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.680]   - Did you get the NES Classic yet?
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:11.480]   - Oh my gosh, I called like four game stops.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.320]   (laughing)
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.680]   - It's like, oh great, you broke Lauren's completely sold out.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.800]   So what's the, so I have no interest,
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.680]   but that's because I'm an old man.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.240]   The NES came out in '85, right?
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.160]   So that's 30 years ago.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.440]   So it would be people who were age five or six
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.520]   at the time.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.360]   - So they've been born in the UK.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.480]   - No, but you had one, you're in your 20s.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:35.040]   How is it that you have this affection for the NES?
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.200]   - Oh, let me explain this to you in some terms.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.200]   - She's a nerd.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.280]   - One of a nerd, too, I grew up in a house I'm four of five
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.040]   children, my oldest sister is nine years older than me.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.880]   Well, one of the easiest ways to make mass entertainment
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.040]   for lots of small children is my dad used to pop in
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.080]   an NES game, and we used to watch him play it.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:55.920]   That's how I grew up playing.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:56.760]   - Watch dad play.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:57.600]   - That's awesome parenting.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.760]   - That's why so many people are on Twitch today.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.600]   - Well done.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.440]   - Yes, and that's why--
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.120]   - They think they're watching their father.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:03.960]   - Yeah.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:04.800]   - Your daddy come home.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.440]   Daddy, stop playing League of Legends and look at me.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.280]   - It's really seeming to me.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.120]   - Don't call me a scrub.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.000]   - But I mean, I grew up in a gaming family,
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.360]   and that's how it goes.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.400]   And I personally think the NES classic is pretty neat.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.640]   - Which mean are you looking forward to playing the most?
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.920]   - Ooh, that's a good question.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:20.760]   - Dragon Quest?
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:23.160]   - Dragon Quest didn't make--
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.000]   - Was that Zelda?
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:24.840]   - Did you make the cut?
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.120]   - Oh, I'm not buying one now.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.280]   - I don't think it made it.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:31.680]   - Probably the one that I'm most interested in playing for real
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.880]   is a little known title by the name of Star Tropics.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.760]   It's actually a game that my parents own,
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.920]   and it's actually very cool.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:40.760]   It's kind of like a little--
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.120]   - Are you gonna like it when you don't have to blow
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.400]   into the cartridge?
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.160]   - Well, the reason why the NES classic
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.720]   is such a boon for retro gamers
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.240]   is that it actually has an HDMI port built in.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.280]   The issue is that when you actually do,
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:55.560]   if you run in a traditional NES through on a modern TV,
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.280]   so not a CRT television,
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.400]   what ends up happening is that there is a lag that develops
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.120]   because they're actually converting the old AV inputs
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.200]   into HDMI.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.440]   So the way that you say play Mario,
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.880]   which is within fractions of a second, for example,
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.080]   it's the difference between you hitting the Goomba
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.400]   and the Goomba hitting you.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.040]   So a lot of people are very excited
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.640]   because then it gives them the opportunity
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.760]   to actually play on their modern televisions
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.760]   with the same response that they're used to--
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.800]   - Actually, I read a review I told you she said--
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.760]   - That said that this is so faithful to the original NES,
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.360]   it actually slows down when you get a lot of players
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.400]   on the screen and everything.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.320]   I mean, it's like--
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.040]   - They didn't mess with the ROM,
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.320]   so the ROM's gonna--
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.920]   - Yeah, but they didn't give the processor
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:37.240]   too much power either.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:38.320]   - No, they did not.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.280]   - So they brought the bad bits along with it?
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.120]   - Yeah. - Not bad.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:44.440]   - And it has three versions, it has a CRT version there.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.760]   - No, stop.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.760]   - You can get the lines.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.200]   - The lines and this, no.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.640]   And then, oh, crazy.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.280]   You remember your first Goomba stop?
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.120]   Who could never forget?
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:52.960]   - I have no idea. - Can we know,
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.160]   I don't know what this language is,
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.120]   this is you young people.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.000]   - Can we hear Lauren say Goomba again?
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.880]   - Goomba?
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.720]   - There we go.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:02.200]   - Let's take a break on that note.
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:06.000]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.960]   Wealthfront is a low, oh, Love Wealthfront.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.320]   Wealthfront is a new category.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.320]   They sometimes call them Robo-investors, right?
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.440]   - Robo-advisors. - Advisors.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.880]   But this does such a good job.
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:18.700]   It's amazing.
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:21.760]   Now, the problem that Robo-advisors solve
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:24.560]   and Wealthfront solves the best of all the Robo-advisors
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:27.840]   is you need to be saving for long-term, right?
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.240]   You need to have a retirement fund,
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.680]   you need to save for college or that house you want to buy,
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.720]   just a rainy day fund.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.800]   And savings nowadays,
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.400]   mean, doesn't mean putting it in the bag.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.040]   'Cause what is a savings account?
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.800]   Like a quarter of a percent or something, it's ridiculous.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.760]   So you're actually losing money, I think,
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.560]   'cause it's barely keeping up with inflation.
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:48.120]   Instead, you need to invest, but you don't have time.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.640]   Trust me, you think you have time.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.200]   You don't have time to run your investment.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.320]   And if you're gonna go out and get an investment advisor,
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:56.240]   you ought to know that traditional advisors charge
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.680]   between one, two, or three percent of what they manage.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.720]   And one of the things that they're talking about,
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:05.960]   deregulating is this rule that requires an investment
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.000]   advisor not to have a stake in the stocks
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.640]   he's telling you to buy.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.360]   That's gonna get turned around, in which case,
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.160]   now not only are they charging one, two, or three percent
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.480]   of what they manage, you can't even trust their advice.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.440]   So, well, friend, this has fixed it all.
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:25.840]   First of all, one quarter of one percent a year,
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.680]   that's 25 basis points with no additional charges,
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:31.400]   no transaction fees, no hidden fees,
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.360]   and it's a computer, so it has no biases.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:39.360]   It's actually, it's doing what it can to maximize your return,
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.120]   minimize your taxes.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.440]   It does something called tax loss harvesting.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:46.040]   You know, you wanna test a financial advisor, ask him,
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.880]   are you doing tax loss harvesting?
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.160]   How often are you checking my balance, my portfolio?
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.120]   Weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly?
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:56.560]   With wealth, right, it's every second,
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.960]   'cause it's a computer.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:01.000]   The system is based on Nobel Prize-winning academic research
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.360]   of the best investment practices,
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.040]   the best investment advisors, people like Burton Malkeill,
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.680]   Charles D. Ellis, these guys wrote the books literally
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.400]   on how to make money on Wall Street,
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.240]   and they have figured it out.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.920]   And I've talked to so many people now who use wealth front
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.280]   because of these ads and who say, it has been great for me.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.200]   They just introduced their 529 college savings plan.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.480]   It's kind of like a Roth IRF for college.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.760]   $3 billion in assets and growing fast because it works.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.440]   But I don't want you to trust me.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:31.640]   I want you to go to wealthfront.com/twit, look at it,
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:35.360]   take a look at the returns, their historic returns,
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.520]   see how it works.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.560]   They'll even generate a sample portfolio for you for free.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.600]   With just a few questions based on, you know,
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:45.560]   your timeframe and your risk tolerance, that kind of thing.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.480]   And you get that for free.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.120]   You could just take that with you,
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.800]   see what allocation they'd recommend.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:53.160]   And if you sign up to invest, I love this,
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:56.320]   a little sweetener, they're gonna manage your first $15,000
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.360]   free of charge forever.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.040]   But you have to go to wealthfront.com/twit,
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:05.200]   wealthfront.com/twit.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.040]   Take a little of that money you set aside
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:10.080]   for your NES Classic, put it in Wealthfront.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.920]   You can start with as little as 500 bucks.
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.080]   We had a great week on tour.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.720]   We had a lot to talk about in our PlayStation Pro review.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.240]   I mean, well, you know what?
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:20.400]   Here's a convenient thing.
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.520]   We happen to have a little trailer
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.560]   that describes it all.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:24.600]   Watch.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.560]   Previously on "Twit."
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.440]   Many elections were watershed moments.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.640]   And if you have historical--
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.480]   That's my tell us.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.920]   --it may not be as historic as we want to think of this.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:36.480]   But this Leo is our first orange president.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.120]   It says, "We're breaking the color barrier."
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.320]   Tech news today.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.200]   You may or may not feel let down by last night's election,
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.920]   but one thing that I think we can agree on
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:47.160]   is the data geeks let us down.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:50.440]   O'Castor's mission was to gather, publish, and analyze voter turnout
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.800]   information in swing states, even though they had so-called data gurus.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.760]   They got almost all of their predictions wrong.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:33:59.960]   This week in Google.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.560]   We in liberal establishment media left a void in a vacuum.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.400]   We didn't listen to and understand the concerns
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.160]   in the worldview of that half of the country.
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.440]   And as a result, that half of the country
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.920]   said, you never reflect us.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.880]   Why should we trust you?
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:12.640]   We don't trust you.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.920]   You don't understand us.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.720]   It's our fault.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:18.440]   We love that, though, because we didn't respect that half of the country.
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:19.200]   --to it.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:23.040]   Friends don't let friends miss to it.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.040]   I'm trying to come back in my carbs.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:24.560]   I get everyone else.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:25.720]   I don't know.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.240]   There's carbs in Red Bull.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:28.600]   That's why I don't drink it very often.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.160]   Oh, OK.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.480]   He's on his third Red Bull.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.000]   I know.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:32.560]   I might get ready.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.760]   And Lauren has tried--
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.840]   --apparently three quarts of diet something.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.680]   It's in my blood.
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.520]   I love the picture.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.680]   Did you see the picture that--
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.120]   --Bico Donald's here.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.400]   I don't-- this guy is Silicon Valley's staff photographer.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:46.840]   He's great.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.360]   He's already posted a picture of Lauren.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.880]   Let me see if I can find it here.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.560]   You haven't seen it yet, have you?
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:53.560]   It's actually pretty funny.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.560]   He's @photo on Twitter.
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.400]   And let me just really quickly--
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.040]   --also one of the nicest guys in the world.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.840]   Here's the picture of Lauren Hockinson.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:03.200]   --ice.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:06.000]   Dear Fries, you make me happy.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.400]   For those of you who don't--
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.320]   --for people who weren't here in the studio,
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.880]   we have a group trip to Burger King
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.080]   before we shot to get fries.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:14.200]   That's another thing that's wrong with your generation.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:14.640]   Really?
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.320]   Burger King for fries?
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:16.960]   Burger King?
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:17.960]   OK, I didn't actually have fries.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:18.440]   Lauren.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.360]   When your options are limited and you can only walk one place--
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.560]   Oh, you had to walk somewhere.
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.520]   Yeah, we got here and then we walked over.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:28.920]   I think I happen to have pancake fries, you should try.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:29.840]   Don't tempt me for--
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.000]   What is this technology?
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.960]   Can you please explain to me--
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:33.960]   We've got a big--
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.880]   We've got a big week ahead.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:36.920]   Let's find out.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:38.640]   Jason Howell has the latest--
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.600]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.200]   Here's a look at a few things that we're
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.880]   going to be watching in the week ahead.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:46.640]   On Tuesday, November 15, Chinese smartphone maker 1+
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.600]   is likely to announce a new device, possibly named
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:54.120]   the 1+3T that's housing atop of the line Snapdragon 821
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.440]   processor and an optic AMOLED display.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.400]   Also on the 15th drone market leader, DJI,
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.360]   is holding an event where it's expected to show off
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.240]   its next gen, inspired drone.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.320]   That's the company's premium drone line that's targeted
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.920]   at Hollywood creators for aerial photography and dual controller
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.120]   capabilities.
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:15.260]   MacBook Pro with Touch Bar was scheduled to begin shipping
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:18.720]   to those who preordered the laptop on Thursday, November 17,
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:23.160]   though some early shipping notices began to hit inboxes on Friday.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:26.560]   Regardless, we'll begin to see these in the wild any day now.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.760]   And finally, starting Friday, November 18,
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.880]   the lasting through the weekend, Blizzard
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.120]   is making its huge hit game Overwatch free to play
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.200]   on all platforms.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.080]   So if you haven't been bitten by the Overwatch bug yet,
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.600]   might as well sacrifice your weekend
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.200]   and realize what you've been missing.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.040]   Mega Moroni and I will cover all of this
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:46.280]   in a whole lot more all week on Tech News today, each and every
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:48.400]   weekday at 4 p.m. Pacific.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.760]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.840]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.160]   Thank you very much, Jason.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.080]   How are Monday through Friday?
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.600]   Of course, Jason also does all about Android.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.000]   It covers latest phones.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.960]   I saw yesterday the new Echo.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.240]   By the way, that is the worst name for a company.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:03.360]   They're Chinese.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.680]   Are they pretending to be French Le Echo?
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:07.680]   Oh, those guys, yeah.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.280]   It's Chinese Le Echo with the cat coach.
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.000]   But they have a beautiful new phone, 300 bucks.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.560]   And it's top of the line features all round.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.440]   I really think that Apple and Google
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.000]   are going to face some stiff competition
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.200]   because they're pricing their phones at 700, 800, 900 bucks.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.400]   Apple's ASPs don't hold up at that sales rate.
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.520]   So if they sold phones at that level,
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:31.600]   they'd see revenue declines and profit declines.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.400]   Financial analyst, ladies and gentlemen, that's Alex Wilhelm.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.320]   He's from Mattermark.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.640]   You can read his brilliant posts there.
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:39.840]   He's the editor-in-chief at mattermark.com.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.320]   And Alex on the Twitter.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:41.720]   True.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.160]   Also, here she's on her own now.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:43.960]   But we love her anyway.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.800]   Lauren Hawkins in the queen of the bow.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.800]   How many bows do you have, Lauren?
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.400]   Take another bow, Lauren.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:52.000]   Take a bow.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.480]   The bow puns are funny because I call my bow collection
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.200]   my rainbow.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.640]   Because I have them in all colors.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.680]   Do you have a special wall in your closet just for a row of bows?
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.920]   Not on my closet, but on a shelf, yes.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.480]   I think it's a great trademark.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.120]   Thank you.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.080]   It's a part of my brand.
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.640]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:08.320]   I'm going to do it.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:11.440]   I wear socks with gold toes, but no one sees it.
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.440]   So no one knows.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:19.920]   Actually, Peter O'Toole is very famous for every day of his life
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.280]   wearing green socks.
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.960]   And he never wore the same pair twice.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.560]   He had a fresh pair of green socks every day.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.320]   Oh, come on.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.120]   No, I'm not kidding.
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.760]   And it snopes again.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.920]   Go ahead, snope it.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.280]   And is that a verb now?
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:30.800]   Snope it.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.360]   It's got to be.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.080]   And again, the thing about the bow is people see it.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.440]   The problem with the green socks, nobody ever saw it.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.440]   Do you actually wear gold tote socks?
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:40.920]   I don't know.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.120]   Let me check.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.640]   Find out.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.800]   No, they just--
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.240]   Why did my socks say car heart?
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.720]   See how great that checking is.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.480]   Do you dress yourself?
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:51.200]   No, I have a valet.
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.640]   I have a valet.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.480]   Downton La Porte.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.680]   Downton La Porte.
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:55.280]   Here comes in.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.640]   He's my-- I call him my bat.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.240]   You should fire him immediately.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.720]   I know.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:01.440]   They tell me this jacket looks frumpy.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.200]   Would you agree?
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.920]   No, I think it looks fresh.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:04.280]   It is.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.760]   It's fresh out of the box.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.520]   It's an LL bean jacket.
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.960]   So it has zippers everywhere.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.720]   It's a travel jacket.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:14.440]   Prepping for that meeting with the Explorers Club, are we?
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.720]   I have a pit velvet in the back.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.720]   The League of Ordinary Gentlemen.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.480]   Oh, you are really cruising.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:20.960]   I'm telling you.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.720]   Hey, for the record, I--
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:23.400]   That was good though.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:23.840]   That was a good one.
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.440]   She still had 7 million red bull.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:25.840]   I know.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.280]   It makes you--
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:27.080]   I've had one--
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.080]   --one of the abses are fired.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:28.360]   One red bull.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:29.280]   What the hell is wrong with you?
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:29.680]   So wait, wait, wait.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.640]   You said something.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.520]   And I feel like there was a deeper meaning
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.880]   to what you said earlier.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.560]   What?
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:35.320]   I forgot now.
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:35.840]   Contact.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:36.200]   The movie--
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:36.680]   --teens.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.240]   Oh, we were talking about arrival.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.640]   During the break, we were talking about--
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.240]   You saw a movie--
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.400]   I saw a rival.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.440]   That's Amy McAdams' new movie about the arrival of aliens.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.240]   And I've been dying to see this.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.600]   The trailer looked fantastic, but you said it was good.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.480]   I don't want to ruin it because higher expectations can--
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.160]   No, no, no.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.360]   I'm not going to spoil anything.
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.040]   But I don't want to raise expectations and ruin it that way.
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.480]   But it is fantastic.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:39:59.200]   Fantastic.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:39:59.760]   Really?
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:02.680]   It's like literally the best alien movie I've ever seen.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:03.640]   Really, really good.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.560]   I can't wait.
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:07.720]   Better than "Alien," which is my best alien movie.
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.760]   That's not an alien movie.
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.200]   That's a horror movie in an alien movie, guys.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.280]   Oh, that's not true.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.920]   It's sci-fi/horror.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:16.680]   OK, sci-fi/horror.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:17.560]   Oh, I'm going to do one of those.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.400]   There's aliens in it.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:19.440]   It's called "Alien."
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.240]   But it's scary as heck.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.720]   But it's not-- I like first contact movies.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:24.080]   You don't like close encounters.
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:24.280]   Right.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:25.920]   [HUMMING]
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.520]   But-- or contact.
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.960]   And what came up was, I noticed for some reason,
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:34.080]   on my iTunes chart, that contact the movie-- what
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:34.240]   is it?
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.960]   20, 30 years old movie with Matthew McConaughey.
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:37.400]   Yep.
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.000]   And Debbie Gibson?
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:40.920]   No.
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.120]   Jody Foster?
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.480]   We started "Rame on TV."
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:46.160]   We watched her grow up, just like Debbie Gibson.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.240]   I don't know who Debbie Gibson is.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.280]   You don't know who I'm talking about.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:49.520]   You don't remember Debbie Gibson.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:51.680]   He hasn't made contact with Debbie Gibson.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.840]   Anyway, that movie is in the top 10.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:54.480]   That's an old movie.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:55.440]   Why isn't the top 10?
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:58.320]   You, Lauren Hockenson, know, but you were refused to reveal.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.560]   I love the millennials, because that is a great movie.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.160]   That is a great, great movie.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.840]   And the millennials recognize it.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.720]   I gave my explanation, which is that contact is seen
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.200]   or a surgeon's with the teens.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.000]   Why?
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.360]   It's popular on Tumblr.
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:13.880]   Why is it popular on Tumblr?
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:14.720]   Because it's a great movie.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.040]   Is it a meme?
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:17.360]   I don't know why the kids--
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.520]   I have to say this to everybody listening and watching
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:23.680]   this show, which is that see arrival as fast as you can.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:25.640]   Because somebody can easily spoil it for you.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.640]   It's a movie full of surprises.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.640]   So go see it before somebody wrecks it.
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:31.120]   I'm going to ask this very delicately.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.600]   But there was a recent legalization
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:34.200]   of a certain thing in California.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:36.320]   Would that said thing perhaps increase enjoyment
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:36.800]   of the show?
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.360]   Or would one like to go perhaps a bit more
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.520]   flat in the mental department?
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.880]   Flat, because I wouldn't--
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:42.920]   It's like the matrix.
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.520]   If you had been high--
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.760]   Oh, we can say high on the show?
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:46.720]   You'd say stone.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.720]   Oh.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.520]   I prefer wacked.
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:51.480]   Gas, wacked out of your brain.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:52.480]   Atolled.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.480]   Atolled.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.520]   At the matrix, you probably would have missed the import of it
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.520]   all.
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:58.520]   You would have come out and gone, as Cana Reeves did.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.520]   Whoa.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.520]   Dude.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.080]   But seeing it straight was even more mind blowing.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.560]   You need all your faculties to get this movie.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.800]   Half the people walked out of the theater going, what happened?
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:08.800]   What just happened?
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.280]   I'll never forget seeing the matrix with that.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.440]   And this is why you won't see it soon, because you don't want--
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.240]   I had no idea what I was going to say.
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.080]   I was like an afternoon matinee, and I had never
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:17.840]   hadn't read anything.
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:18.840]   I had no idea.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.320]   When Murphy's told him what's going on,
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.320]   you were just like Cana Reeves.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.320]   The blue pill?
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.320]   The red pill?
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:24.320]   I want the red pill.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.320]   Give me the red pill.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:27.520]   I had my eyes were like this going out of the theater, because I
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.520]   was thinking, thinking, thinking.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.520]   So it's like that.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:30.520]   Yeah, I saw it in Paris.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.520]   And it's like it didn't even--
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.720]   But you were in Paris yesterday?
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:33.720]   No, no.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:34.720]   I saw the matrix.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.720]   Oh, the matrix.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:36.720]   Back when it first came out.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:37.720]   That's still a pretty good brag.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:38.720]   Ricky's in the matrix.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:39.720]   Oh, I was in Antarctica, no big deal.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720]   We saw it twice.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.720]   We went back the next day.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:43.720]   Was it French?
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:44.720]   We saw it once with subtitles and once dubbed.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.720]   That would be weird.
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:46.720]   It was better with subtitles.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.920]   How would you say Sentinel in French?
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:54.920]   Sentinel.
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.720]   That's not quite as scary.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:57.720]   Sentinel.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:00.720]   Anyways, see arrival.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:01.720]   Muffie.
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:05.720]   Gisbee, Muffie.
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:07.720]   What a show.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:08.720]   Are you still talking to me?
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.720]   Sounds totally darn sorry.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.720]   Je m'appelle, nio.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:15.720]   No pal d'omois, nio.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.720]   All right.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:17.720]   Our show today.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:18.720]   I speak teen.
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.720]   I'm going to do another ad because I feel like a nap.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:25.000]   And when I think nap, you know what I think of?
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.880]   My Casper mattress is waiting for me at home.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.640]   Very comfortable.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.720]   This is a great, great mattress.
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.720]   This mattress is unbelievable.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:40.960]   And mine is actually huge because I have the huge, huge.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.280]   I have the king, the California king.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:44.280]   But you can get it in twin.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.280]   You can get it in king.
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.280]   You can get it in queen.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:48.960]   You can get it in California king and a much more affordable price.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:49.960]   Now I know what you're saying.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.400]   You're saying, Leo, I'm not going to buy a mattress without lying on it.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.560]   But really, let me ask you something.
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.640]   The last time you lay on a mattress in a mattress store, was that a satisfying experience?
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:02.600]   Would you really get a sense of what that mattress is going to be like when you get
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.600]   it home?
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.600]   No, because it's broad daylight.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:09.240]   You got your shoes on and the salesperson is looking at you like, and that's no fun.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.960]   Not for anyone.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.240]   So when the Casper mattress comes, see, you know, you don't have one night or two.
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.320]   Nights are even 10 minutes.
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:22.760]   You got a hundred nights to lie on it to whatever moves you, whatever you need to test it.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.520]   I personally jumped up and down.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:32.280]   And then I invited my close personal friend, Aussie the dog, to lie on it with me.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:33.720]   And when Aussie said, we have this.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:36.280]   Is Aussie heavy enough to like actually seven pounds?
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:38.520]   He didn't even put it skirts across.
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:39.520]   He didn't put it on it.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:43.440]   No, but he did like it because it has just the right sink, just the right bounce.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.800]   It's firm because it's got the memory foam, but it also has the latex on top of it.
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:50.240]   It just gives you a little, so your hips.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:53.800]   See, this is, you know, sometimes your hips like you feel like your flow.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:58.600]   It's no, this goes, they go in, but then they find respite.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:02.240]   It's the 2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award winner.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:04.640]   One of the best mattresses you ever eat.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.440]   It's best, the best.
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:10.120]   One of the best I've ever slept on sleeps cool.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.600]   So he's never too hot.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.600]   He never sweaty.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:17.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:20.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:21.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:22.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:23.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:24.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:25.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:31.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:33.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:39.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:49.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600]   He never got the best.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600]   He never got the best.

[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:28.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:29.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:30.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:31.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:32.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:34.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:35.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:39.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:40.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:42.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:43.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:44.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:45.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:48.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:49.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:50.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:51.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:52.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:53.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:54.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:56.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:58.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:57:59.600]   He never got the best.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:00.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:01.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:02.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:03.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:04.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:05.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:06.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:07.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:08.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:09.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:10.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:11.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:12.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:13.600]   He never got the best.
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:16.600]   I want to mention this week in cyber.
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.600]   DDoS attack.
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.600]   Halts heating in Finland.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:22.600]   Oh my gosh.
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:24.600]   That seemed to be in the middle of winter.
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:26.600]   It's getting pretty cold in Finland.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:27.600]   Maybe this is not the best time.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.600]   This is from Metropolitan.fi.
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.600]   It was from Finland in English.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:36.600]   Apparently the site has been DDoSed because I can't.
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:37.600]   There we go.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:38.600]   I can't load it.
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:41.600]   It's 27 degrees Fahrenheit right now in Helsinki.
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:42.600]   Oh, it's not that cold.
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:44.600]   That's still below freezing.
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:51.600]   Disabled computers that were heating buildings in two properties in the city of, and I shouldn't speak Finnish.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:52.600]   No, go for it, please.
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.600]   La Pen-Ranta.
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:55.600]   That was excellent.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:56.600]   La Pen-Ranta.
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:59:04.600]   Both of the buildings managed by the same company and apparently the systems called the central heating and water circulation disabled.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.600]   By DDoSed attacks.
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:09.600]   Really, I could do a whole thing on this week in DDoSed attacks.
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:13.600]   There's a new attack that reportedly lets one laptop.
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:16.600]   It's called, you like the name, Black Nurse.
[01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:17.600]   I didn't name it.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:27.600]   It lets one laptop knock off big servers using ICMP, a special kind of ICMP target attack.
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.600]   Normally you'd need hundreds of gigabytes.
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:38.600]   In fact, in some cases terabytes, or terabits I should say, the attack that took DIND and S-C.
[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:43.600]   Took DIND and S-offline and the Krebs website offline was a terabit per second and more.
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:52.600]   But this one is very effective and nearly needs 15 megabits to target the firewall.
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:54.600]   Firewalls then drop so many packets.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:57.600]   Apparently a problem in Cisco Firewalls.
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:01.600]   Drop so many packets that the server behind the device just disappears.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:04.600]   One laptop can bring you down.
[02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:05.600]   Nice.
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:06.600]   There's some good news.
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:10.600]   Russian banks hit by cyber attack.
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:13.600]   We don't know though if it's a Russian attacker, right?
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.600]   The state owned, ironically, Suburbank.
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:18.600]   I think they misspelled cyber.
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:22.600]   Suburbank brought down also by a DDoS attack.
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:26.600]   Kaspersky says is one of the largest it seemed, it seemed aimed at Russian banks.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.600]   Kaspersky does a very good job of always getting their names and security stories.
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:31.600]   I know, they're good.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:32.600]   They have really effective PR.
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:33.600]   They're good.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:35.600]   So this adult friend finder.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.600]   That's the next one.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.600]   The big one probably bothering a few people right now.
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:46.600]   Friend finder network owns a lot of adult sites.
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:48.600]   And how strip show Icams?
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:49.600]   Not that I'm an expert on.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:50.600]   Cams.com.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:51.600]   You seem to get those off the top.
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:52.600]   It's right off.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:54.600]   Encyclopedic knowledge of the source.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:58.600]   412 million accounts, email addresses and passwords.
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.600]   As far as reports go, no sexual preferences were released.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:06.600]   What's interesting about this is that everybody remembers the Ashley Madison hack.
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.600]   That was only 32 million accounts.
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:09.600]   This is 412 million.
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:15.600]   And worse, according to leaks source, the friend fire network had stored their passwords in
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:24.600]   plain text or using SHA1, which is easily broken, zeding it attained a portion of the database
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:31.480]   and not only confirmed its legitimacy but was able to crack almost all the passwords with
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:32.480]   simple rainbow tables.
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:38.480]   You're just hoping that all of those users had their trash, tertiary Yahoo accounts associated
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:39.480]   with adult friend finder.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:41.480]   Although it's ironic to bring up Yahoo accounts in this context.
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:47.480]   You did get the most recent access time and date, so don't try to deny it, gentlemen.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:48.480]   Here's the worst part.
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:54.480]   The hack also revealed that 15 million accounts that users had deleted were also released.
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:57.480]   So people, if you deleted your friend finder account, it's still out there.
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:01.480]   You thought maybe I'll try it once just to see what happens too late.
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.480]   Now you're going to find out what happens.
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:04.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:05.480]   Never date.
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:06.480]   Never date.
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:07.480]   Never wait.
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:08.480]   Wait, wait, wait, really?
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:09.480]   No.
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:10.480]   Okay.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:12.480]   No, if you don't date, how are you going to reproduce?
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:13.480]   Never date.
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:14.480]   Not on a dolphin.
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:15.480]   I'm sorry.
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:16.480]   You set that off yourself.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:17.480]   Never date.
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:23.480]   Let's talk about emojis when we, oh, before we do, Snapchat.
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:24.480]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:27.480]   Did any of you get to the vending machine today?
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:28.480]   In the big circles.
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:30.480]   Yeah, it was like in the middle of nowhere.
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:31.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:32.760]   And there was still a line.
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:34.480]   And there was a long line.
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.040]   False scarcity works as a marketing technique.
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:40.440]   So they don't have many of these spectacles, but you, and where they're selling them, I
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.640]   guess is they're doing kind of pop-up vending machines, which they announced shortly before
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:46.320]   it becomes available.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.320]   So people, where do they watch?
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.240]   You watch on Snapchat, obviously, right?
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:50.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.320]   It shoots this kind of like circular video in a square and you can only see the circle.
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:55.160]   And I saw some footage from one today.
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.880]   It was just not that cool.
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:57.880]   Frankly.
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:02:58.880]   Oh, really?
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.880]   No.
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:01.160]   Can you get excited about this?
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:03.160]   I want to pair so bad.
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:04.880]   Well, OK, here's the question.
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:05.880]   Oh, go ahead.
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:06.880]   Go ahead.
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:07.880]   I insist.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.440]   I was just going to say, I want to see the photo quality on it.
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:16.800]   Like, if, to me, the only thing that I'd be interested in is if it shoots photos or videos
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:21.160]   at like this much better quality than the phone, and then not only do you get like the
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.880]   sort of day in the life look, but then you actually have like a reason to use it because
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:26.600]   otherwise like, you know, pull out your phone.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:27.600]   Take a selfie.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:31.880]   What I want to know is why was Google Glass such a catastrophe of privacy violation, whereas
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:34.400]   the snap glasses are OK.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:38.720]   There's a big difference between what the spectacles can do and what glass can do in
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.560]   terms of recording length, audio quality, and where it's safe to.
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:46.600]   It's obvious that you're, I don't know, on Google Glass, it was always obvious.
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:49.400]   There was a little light in these these light up here instead.
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:50.400]   Yeah.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:53.200]   But I mean, there's so incredibly dorky people are going to worry them all the time anyways.
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:54.200]   So maybe so.
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:58.680]   But also say that like we're not going to get to that argument until they have a mainstream
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:03.400]   distribution at the capacity that Google Glass had.
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:07.720]   The more people that you see with them and if they do become an everyday wearable, which
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.720]   they won't.
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:09.720]   No way.
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:10.720]   Yeah.
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:12.160]   There are only supposed to be a few thousand this year.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:13.640]   So only 130 bucks.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:14.640]   That's another difference.
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:16.040]   Well, for now, tenth the cost.
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:18.520]   They're only appealing because they're it's a fad.
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:19.520]   It's new.
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:20.520]   They're hard to get.
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:21.520]   Et cetera.
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.760]   As soon as they're just generally available, nobody's going to care.
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:23.760]   It's going to be really dumb.
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:25.880]   Yeah, this was this most recent one this morning.
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:30.280]   You had a hike through a state park to get to the vending machine and they look like party
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:31.280]   city sunglasses.
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:32.280]   Yeah.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:33.280]   Party city.
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:34.280]   Yeah.
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:36.640]   Like the party supply store.
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:37.640]   Oh, thank you.
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:38.640]   They're cheap.
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.640]   Yeah, they look like just plastic glass chair.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:41.640]   Plastic glasses.
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:42.640]   Right.
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:43.640]   New Year's Eve glasses.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:46.600]   But oh, no, I guess they're so smart to manage a scarcity like this because if you do have
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:50.240]   a pair, all your friends will you have the spectacles and you're going to be famous.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:51.240]   It's like the rose gold iPhone.
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.240]   Oh my gosh.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:53.240]   I'm so glad all seven of them.
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:59.560]   But I had heard that they were going to offer them to heavy influencers on Snapchat first.
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:00.560]   Yeah.
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:03.480]   But this vending machine thing is even better because every if you hear, oh, you got to
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:06.120]   be an influencer on Snapchat that I'm going to go well.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:07.120]   Never.
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:10.720]   But I might be able to get to a vending machine that was in Santa Monica, Loma Vista.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:11.720]   Now big sir.
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:14.960]   I think it's incredibly intelligent marketing tools, but I'm not sure how good it is for
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:16.840]   a revenue driving tool.
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:21.920]   And that's what Snapchat needs spectacles to be a revenue positive, gross margin positive
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:22.920]   device.
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:24.120]   They need more revenue than you go more quickly.
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:27.840]   And so so far, I don't see evidence, but I was hoping to see as a dork.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:28.840]   All right.
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:30.440]   That's why I'm not cool enough for Snapchat.
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:31.440]   Do you use Snapchat?
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.440]   No, really?
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:33.440]   No.
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.440]   Well, no, what are you not interested?
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:35.440]   No, I said I'm not cool enough to use Snapchat.
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:37.440]   Lauren, you use Snapchat.
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:39.200]   I use Snapchat occasionally.
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:40.760]   I'm well uses it.
[02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:42.000]   Younger people that's using it.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:47.720]   I find that people in our demographic and all the way down through, I would say like
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:51.000]   there are people who have a lot of value in Snapchat.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:57.080]   I'm personally, I just don't find it to be like a great, I'm not very creative in the
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:05:58.080]   way that I think that I would need to be.
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:01.000]   It's too much work for me for something that's going to disappear in 24 hours.
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.200]   This is why my Instagram is also kind of an e-max, sorry.
[02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:05.960]   Also, I look horrible in selfies.
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:10.000]   So like I'm like, my face doesn't send devices by actually using the product, I feel like
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000]   I don't know.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000]   It doesn't really come out there well.
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.800]   Did you see the first episode of season three of Black Mary yet?
[02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:16.800]   I've heard it's really good.
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:20.160]   It's all about basically this.
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:21.680]   Everybody lives on their cell phone.
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:24.360]   First it says, this is a science fiction.
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:25.760]   Everybody's walking around looking at their cell phone.
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:29.160]   But you rate everybody, everybody constantly.
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:34.840]   And if your rating drops below four, you can't get things.
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:36.240]   They won't let you rent a car.
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:37.240]   I don't know that.
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:39.360]   You're under 4.1, you're going to have to use that line.
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:41.080]   So what if Tinder but for oppression?
[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:43.240]   Yeah, and it's very oppressive.
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.400]   Well, it's a great episode if you haven't seen it.
[02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:48.560]   Are soon to be President Zabic, fan of the one through ten rating system?
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:51.880]   That was a preamble.
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:54.000]   You're a ten in my book.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.000]   Out of 100?
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000]   Apps out of 100.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000]   That's very good.
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.640]   I didn't even have to make up a joke.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:02.760]   Our show today brought to you by Square Space.
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:03.760]   I'm so excited.
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:08.200]   Square Space and my leo report.com is my square space site.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:14.480]   Made it very easy, literally a check box to do HTTPS now on your website.
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:15.960]   They're using Let's Encrypt.
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:18.040]   But that you don't even need to know the back end of that.
[02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:24.640]   You're getting TLS, secure encryption automatically if you have a square space site.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:26.680]   Just one more reason to use Square Space.
[02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:28.280]   Square Space is the best hosting.
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:29.280]   They're a host.
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:32.360]   Plus the best software that makes it easy.
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:38.040]   Super easy for you to create a gorgeous website that is your aesthetic, your thing.
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:45.440]   Whether you're a business, an individual, a journalist, an artist, it's great for portfolios.
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:49.720]   If your online store has never been easier to sell online, mobile's built in, every
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:50.720]   site is mobile responsive.
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:52.160]   That means you don't have multiple sites.
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:55.760]   You have one site that looks great no matter what size screen.
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:59.920]   Actually, if you go and set up a trial site, which is free, you'll see because all you
[02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:01.360]   do is take your browser, squeeze it down.
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:05.200]   You'll see how every page just automatically resizes when you upload a picture.
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:11.000]   It generates, I think, nine different sizes of that image so that you always have the
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:15.640]   option to work great on it like that.
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:16.640]   See how good it looks?
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:17.640]   Every template.
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:19.720]   Plus every template comes as Commerce.
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:23.600]   The new Square Space Commerce app, which you run on your smartphone, lets you fulfill orders,
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:24.600]   manage product inventory.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:27.560]   Yes, manage product inventory on a Square Space site.
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:31.000]   Without an additional add-on, that's part of the deal.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.800]   You can resolve customer issues directly from iOS or Android.
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:39.200]   Plus with Square Space Commerce, it's the only platform that lets you create, manage,
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:41.400]   and brand your store in a beautiful way.
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:43.640]   It doesn't look like something hanging off the side of your website.
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:45.280]   It looks exactly like your website.
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:46.560]   It's integrated right in there.
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:51.240]   They have a basic e-commerce plan, an advanced plan with features for your growing business,
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:54.680]   and they handle the payments infrastructure so you can accept payments right away.
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:57.760]   You don't have to go hat and hand to a bank or anything.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:00.280]   With an annual purchase of a Square Space site, you'll get a free domain.
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:01.440]   They do sell domain names now.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.680]   They have 300 TLDs.
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:05.360]   You can get a domain name of your choice.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:08.320]   By the way, your landing page is gorgeous.
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:13.160]   It's not one of those, I don't want to say the other guys, but the jokey landing pages
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:16.800]   where you've registered a domain name, but you never made a site and they get this disgusting
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:17.800]   thing.
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:19.720]   No, you get a beautiful Square Space page.
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:21.720]   I love Square Space.
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:25.920]   Man, it really confirmed to me how much I love Square Space when I was just, and I did
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:29.400]   this during security now on Tuesday.
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:32.320]   Steve mentioned this and I said, "That's awesome."
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:40.080]   I literally logged into my Square Space site, checked a box, and now I'm HTTPS, leoloport.com.
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:41.080]   Wow.
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:42.640]   Look, I'll show you.
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:43.640]   I'll show you.
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:44.640]   I'll show you.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:49.880]   Go to Settings, you go to Security, and SSL, and it's a checkbox.
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:50.880]   That's it.
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:53.240]   Secure, preferred, or insecure.
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:54.240]   I went there.
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:59.280]   I didn't have HTTPS, so I said insecure, and I said, "Oh, I'd like to make it secure."
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:00.280]   That's it.
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:03.320]   That's the easiest HTTPS I've ever done.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.320]   Who chooses insecure?
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.320]   Yeah, right.
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:06.320]   The Joker.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:08.640]   So, they're thinking to describe themselves.
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:09.640]   I'm pretty insecure.
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:10.640]   I'm insecure.
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:14.120]   Actually, if you have an existing Square Space site, make sure you go and turn that on, because
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:15.520]   it is fantastic.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:16.520]   Squarespace.com.
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:21.320]   You can get a free trial right now, and if you decide to buy, you'll save 10 percent
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:23.080]   if you use the offer code TWIT.
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:26.000]   It's also a way you can tell them that you heard it on TWIT and do that, because Square
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:31.280]   Space now advertises on every darn podcast in the world, and they got to know you heard
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:33.040]   it on TWIT.
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:34.040]   Right?
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.720]   Just adding to that my personal website is on Squarespace.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:37.720]   It's good, isn't it?
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:38.720]   Yeah.
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:39.720]   So easy.
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:40.720]   I can't code.
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:41.720]   Well, that's the thing.
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:42.720]   I mean, I can.
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:43.720]   For years did my own site from the scratch.
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:46.480]   I was self-hosted using WordPress.
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:51.720]   I used every type pad, every possible blogging platform.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:53.040]   We use it for everything.
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:56.560]   When my son got married, you went to the wedding, it was this Kevin Anandia.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:57.560]   Perfect.
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:58.560]   Put it on there, it was beautiful.
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.560]   It's easy.
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:00.560]   Yes, beautiful.
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:01.560]   My wife's food blog is on there.
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:02.560]   It's like so easy.
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:04.560]   I now started to use it for my pictures.
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:08.040]   In fact, I have a bunch of pictures that upload from our trip, because it's like a
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:12.600]   beautiful portfolio for you.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:13.760]   The new emojis are here.
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:14.760]   The new emojis are here.
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:19.400]   We actually had a great interview with Jeremy Bruj, who was the founder of Emojipedia yesterday
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:20.600]   on the new screensabers.
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.160]   He was here actually after Twit last week, and I said, "Come back."
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:26.360]   He was going to the Unicode Consortium meeting.
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:28.160]   He's on the Emoji Committee.
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:29.160]   Remember that show?
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:30.160]   They get emoji committee.
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:31.160]   There's an emoji committee.
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:32.160]   Wow.
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:35.960]   In fact, he tells me that some of the other people in the Unicode Consortium are a little
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:41.960]   miffed at all the attention emojis get, because Unicode is a whole lot more than emojis.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:46.240]   It's the character set, and Apple, and Google, and Microsoft, and everybody goes in there.
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:49.840]   It's engineers, and they figure out what can we do, what the representation of every
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:50.840]   graphic is.
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:55.840]   But they also get every year, hundreds of requests for thousands of requests for new
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:00.040]   emojis, and they approve 59 of them.
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:02.000]   Do you guys?
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.800]   I keep asking you millennial questions.
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:05.800]   Like, you're the only millennials I know.
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:07.480]   Do you have children?
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:08.480]   I have children.
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:10.000]   But you use emojis, right?
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.160]   I use emojis.
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:13.200]   Is it just moms that use emojis in dance?
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:14.200]   No, no.
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:16.640]   I started out using them ironically to make fun of people that use emojis, but then I
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:17.640]   found the chart emojis.
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:19.880]   I got totally enamored, and I fell down the hole.
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:20.880]   What are the chart emojis?
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:21.880]   The graphs?
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:22.880]   Yeah.
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:25.120]   Yeah, those are just full of my days to say, life.
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:30.240]   I just feel like, I mean, look, I'm a good writer.
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.200]   You guys are all writers.
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:39.920]   English is an amazing tool, but it doesn't always communicate things like sarcasm, emotion.
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:42.360]   And so that's where emoticons came from initially.
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:45.720]   And emojis, I think, are a very refined way to enhance prose.
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:49.520]   And the new one helps people who are in disenfranchised groups.
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:51.320]   For example, there's a hijab emoji.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:52.320]   I love that they do.
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:53.320]   There's a breastfeeding emoji.
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:13:00.120]   And the one in my group, my disevent, whatever I said, group, pie, pie is back, pie is back
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:04.560]   and I need to hear that, you know, the pie people have to be represented against the
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:06.120]   forces of cake, obviously.
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:07.120]   Obviously.
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:08.120]   And the jerks over in the pastry domain.
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:09.120]   It's completely hell.
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:12.800]   There's really interesting stuff about pastry people is the emoji committee.
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:14.400]   It has to be very politically correct.
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:16.400]   It's got to be global, right?
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:17.400]   Right.
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:18.800]   And it also has to be gender neutral.
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:22.000]   Google's been really strong on assisting us to their credit.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.720]   So all the career emojis, you know, policemen and stuff have to have a male and female counterpart.
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:28.880]   They ran up a little get.
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:30.360]   This is weird.
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:32.680]   A little problem with breastfeeding.
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:35.760]   Now one would think that'd be the domain of women.
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:41.040]   But I'm told Jeremy tells me 1% of all men can breastfeed.
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:43.040]   Something to look forward to, to aspire to, right?
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:44.040]   Wow.
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:50.040]   They, the way they solved this, they didn't want to have a male and female breastfeeding.
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:53.040]   So they just cut the head off the emoji.
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.080]   So there's no apparent gender.
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:57.840]   But look, the fish woman is clearly one.
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:58.840]   They have both.
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:13:59.840]   Oh, they do.
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:00.840]   They call it a Merle.
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:01.840]   A Merle.
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:02.840]   It's no.
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:05.920]   In the emoji committee, it's a Merle person and there's a male and female.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.720]   Oh my gosh, actually that's amazing.
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:08.720]   Isn't that great?
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:10.720]   I'm all, I'm all for about equal representation of Merle people.
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:12.760]   Now I can wear a fish tail too.
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:13.760]   You always couldn't.
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:15.760]   You have to wear the silly shell bra.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:16.760]   Or.
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:17.760]   Or you could.
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:18.760]   Do I.
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:19.760]   Gender than Indian.
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:21.240]   Well, if you're breastfeeding, you don't need it.
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:22.240]   Right.
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:23.240]   He's not in the 1%.
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:24.240]   I don't know.
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:25.240]   You don't know.
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:26.240]   You don't know.
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:28.720]   Look, look, there's an emoji that represents all the nuts out there.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:30.280]   Actually, I don't know if this got approved.
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:31.280]   These are...
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.280]   That's the whole audience.
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:33.280]   The emoji's.
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:34.280]   The emoji's.
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:42.280]   59 new ones in the Unicode standard, they won't get there immediately because your operating
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:44.360]   system has to be modified and so forth.
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:45.860]   There's a emoji.
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:50.200]   Although the Unicode community doesn't describe it as shh, because that's not globally understood.
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:51.800]   They just say finger over mouth.
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:53.760]   Yes, it means different things in different countries.
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:54.760]   What does it mean?
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:55.760]   What other things could it mean?
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:58.040]   I'm not exactly sure, but I mean hand gestures in general.
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:01.480]   I think in Italy, almost every hand gesture means you're a cuckold, right?
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:02.480]   I think so.
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:03.480]   I think that's what it means.
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:04.480]   I certainly couldn't comment.
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:05.560]   I slept with your wife.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:06.560]   If you do that.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:08.560]   Anyway, I'm just guessing.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:09.560]   I don't speak Italian.
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:10.560]   I don't speak Italian.
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.240]   Given the recent politicization of the word cuck, we should probably avoid the entire topic.
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:15.560]   Is cuck sure for cuckold?
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:16.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:20.600]   What I will say is that a picture is worth a thousand words, so by the transitive property,
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:21.600]   that means an emoji.
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:22.600]   59,000 words.
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:25.360]   And emoji is at least worth a thousand words.
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:28.080]   An emoji is just kind of a frozen sentiment in picture form, right?
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:30.480]   So it's kind of a hashtag without words or letters.
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:31.480]   Just fine.
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:32.480]   It's a cool way to go about communicating.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:36.520]   It's not better than words, but it's a useful, additive in certain context.
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:43.320]   I find sometimes that it's very important, for example, when I am texting with my significant
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:46.000]   other and I say, "Can you get milk from the store?"
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.360]   Any text back a dog emoji, that means...
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:49.360]   What does that mean?
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:50.360]   That means, yep, uh-huh.
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:51.360]   That's it.
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:52.360]   Because dogs are subservient.
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:55.360]   Dog, dog, no, we just co-opted the dog.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.360]   Don't define relationship.
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:58.360]   We've co-opted the dog emoji as a way for us to acknowledge...
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:15:59.360]   But it's an inside.
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.360]   Yeah, it's like a partnership relationship.
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:02.360]   That's nice.
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:05.160]   Instead of saying like smiley face or kissy face, we do dog emoji.
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:06.160]   It's like agreement.
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:11.600]   It means like agreement or like, kind of like a rock.
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:16.560]   Well now, if you forget your hijab, you can just send an emoji to him and he can send
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:17.560]   you.
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:18.560]   Exactly.
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:21.800]   The habejim, a job emoji was proposed first by a Rauf Al-O-Medi.
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:24.080]   She's a 15-year-old girl from Saudi Arabia.
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:27.120]   She told the BBC during a group chat with her friends on social media.
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.320]   She realized there was no emoji to represent her ahead scarf wearing.
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:33.600]   Woman, I love that.
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:34.600]   She wrote an email in.
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:35.600]   It's so great.
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:36.600]   And they helped her...
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:39.200]   Actually a member of the Unicode subcommittee said you're right.
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:44.000]   Helped her write a proposal because there's a very specific RFP that they have to follow.
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.000]   And it was approved.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.840]   In hindsight, it's very obvious that that should have been there from the get-go.
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:52.720]   To me, and I write a lot about writing.
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:57.880]   So I even have an article out there right now about writing for 2017 as opposed to 2016.
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:59.360]   Check it out.
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:06.920]   And emoji, there's a necessity because of the exposure of social media, in my opinion.
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:09.880]   There's a need for vagueness and emoji feels that need.
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:12.280]   So emoji helps you be vague.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:15.080]   It helps you communicate things without being specific.
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:16.440]   This is the Finland emoji.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:22.280]   So Finland, the government of Finland, proposed for emojis.
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:25.560]   There's a person in a steamy room that's Sona.
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:27.040]   There's woolly socks.
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:29.120]   Because it's cold.
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.560]   But I don't get the heavy metal head in the middle.
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:37.120]   Dude, Northern Europe is famous for cultivating and making blackened death metal and just met
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:38.600]   death metal generally very popular.
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:39.600]   And so...
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:40.600]   And then is the home of death metal?
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:41.600]   You've touched on Alice's door for the house.
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:42.600]   It's just death metal.
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:43.600]   Yeah, it's just death metal.
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:44.600]   See, it sounds like that.
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:45.600]   See?
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:46.600]   That right.
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:47.600]   The baby did a great impression of death metal.
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:48.600]   The baby was actually doing this.
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:49.600]   Yeah, and it's hands were both eyes.
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:51.600]   Do they have more death metal bands for capita?
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:56.560]   No, I should point out the way it works is there's a text description of the emoji.
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:00.840]   And then every company that implements the emoji, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, does their
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:01.840]   own version of this.
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:06.360]   So this is the sample that the emoji committee provides.
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:07.760]   I love this.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:08.760]   It's a gender neutral.
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:09.760]   Right?
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:10.760]   So we don't need two.
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:11.760]   We need one.
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:12.760]   Could be a man.
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:13.760]   Could be a woman.
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:14.760]   Doing the hunkum horns.
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:15.760]   Right?
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:16.760]   That's what that is.
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:18.000]   The hunkum horns is Texas like this.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000]   This is double horns for metal.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.500]   What's the difference between hunkum horns?
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:21.500]   Well, one's about an angle.
[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:22.500]   The steer.
[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:23.500]   One's about an angle.
[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:24.500]   So Texas.
[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:25.500]   Metal.
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:26.500]   Texas.
[02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:27.500]   Yeah.
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:28.500]   Metal.
[02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:29.500]   What if you're into Texas metal?
[02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:31.380]   So if you're a Texas agian one down in Christ.
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:32.380]   And you're into metal.
[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:34.220]   You do like one narrow and one wide.
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:37.780]   Actually, if you're looking for a band recommendation in Southern metal, check out down.
[02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:38.780]   Quick group.
[02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:39.780]   Okay.
[02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:41.420]   And then that's a Rosie the Riveter, right?
[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:42.940]   What does that have to do with filming?
[02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:43.940]   Women are strong.
[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:44.940]   Girl power.
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:45.940]   Girl power.
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:47.700]   So I think that this is pretty interesting.
[02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:52.060]   I mean, obviously you have Unicode emoji, which is one aspect of this, but you also have
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:57.540]   the ability thanks to new keyboard functionality on smartphones that you can create emoji for
[02:18:57.540 --> 02:18:58.900]   whatever you'd like.
[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:05.140]   For example, the Joanna Stern from Wall Street Journal, she actually has an entire emoji
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:07.740]   set that is drawings of her dog.
[02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:10.380]   Which were drawn by Nathan Oliver's jobs.
[02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:11.380]   Yeah.
[02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:12.380]   They did it together.
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:13.380]   Yeah.
[02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:14.380]   So you can, you can create your own.
[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:15.380]   But you can buy that.
[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:18.140]   I bought or downloaded from the Apple messages store and I did.
[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:20.140]   And I think that it's great because although in--
[02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:21.980]   So those are stickers, not emojis.
[02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:23.580]   Well, so here's the thing, right?
[02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:27.860]   I think that it's really great and there's a great opportunity to expand Unicode and
[02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:32.940]   to create more emojis that better fit the global experience, right?
[02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:35.140]   And that more people are interested.
[02:19:35.140 --> 02:19:36.140]   It's okay.
[02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:38.140]   You can labor here.
[02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:39.140]   We have a--
[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:40.140]   She's the baby emoji.
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:41.140]   Yeah, baby emoji.
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:42.700]   Baby alert emoji.
[02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:46.980]   But you know, I think that it's great that Unicode, we're able to expand on it and that
[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:49.780]   it will take some time and I do appreciate the process of it.
[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:53.020]   But I also appreciate the fact that there is a grassroots opportunity.
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:58.260]   If you really love emoji and you want to speak to your friends in a certain way, you
[02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:03.700]   know, you can create and download those keyboards, those stickers and really do it kind of DIY.
[02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:04.700]   I kind of prefer that.
[02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:09.580]   I use stickers and I also use animated GIFs and I love that Apple and others have given
[02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:15.300]   us a search tool so I can search for baked beans and send somebody a baked bean animated
[02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:16.300]   GIF.
[02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:17.300]   I've never heard of that.
[02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:18.740]   I've never heard of baked beans animated GIF in my life.
[02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:20.140]   Why would you want to do that?
[02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:21.140]   Somebody in Boston?
[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:22.140]   This is some old memes.
[02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:23.140]   Senior memes.
[02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:25.940]   I want beans for dinner.
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:26.940]   I want emoji.
[02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:28.940]   Wait back in the depression.
[02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:31.140]   We're going to have beans.
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:34.500]   Actually, I got a text this morning from my wife.
[02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:35.500]   I was up.
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:36.820]   She wasn't yet.
[02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:40.940]   And it was-- the reason I thought of baked beans, it was a cup of coffee.
[02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:42.900]   It wasn't nonverbal text.
[02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:43.900]   It was a cup of coffee.
[02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:46.300]   And then what I thought were beans.
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:48.780]   But in turned out, I brought her some beans.
[02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:51.820]   But turned out she meant to send me grapes.
[02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:53.220]   She wanted grapes, not beans.
[02:20:53.220 --> 02:20:54.620]   So this is why we have words.
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:55.620]   That's amazing.
[02:20:55.620 --> 02:20:56.620]   Some words might have been a bit of you.
[02:20:56.620 --> 02:20:59.460]   I'm much better with the words and with the emojis.
[02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:00.460]   That's what I get.
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:03.260]   If I got paid to write emojis, it'd be pretty interesting though.
[02:21:03.260 --> 02:21:04.260]   I'm trying to try it.
[02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:09.580]   That story reminds me of a great family tale of mine where my dad got the shopping list
[02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:12.900]   to go to Costco and my mother had written down eggs.
[02:21:12.900 --> 02:21:16.540]   But instead, he bought a Costco-sized box of Eggos.
[02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:19.540]   Oh, see, the difference is that actually an accident or is that on purpose?
[02:21:19.540 --> 02:21:20.540]   I would never--
[02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:21.540]   You know, my dad is a clever dude.
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:22.540]   I'm pretty sure.
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:24.340]   I mean, all of us were like, nice.
[02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:29.260]   I wonder if-- this is really a fertile territory for couples that they have their own emoji
[02:21:29.260 --> 02:21:32.340]   language that they-- sounds like you do and sounds like I do.
[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:35.300]   We give you a language already about how you talk to one another, what jokes are okay
[02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:36.460]   when names you call each other.
[02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:39.020]   Yeah, it's standard.
[02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:41.580]   It's just nice that it's a part of the greater communication experience.
[02:21:41.580 --> 02:21:47.380]   I'm all for messaging apps being enhanced rather than niche-ifying apps in a way.
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:53.180]   I don't want to have my own app to talk to my family or to my partner.
[02:21:53.180 --> 02:22:00.620]   I want to be able to use the platform that I know and love, which is normally I message,
[02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:02.380]   but sometimes actually it's even Facebook Messenger.
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:03.380]   I know.
[02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:04.380]   I know.
[02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:05.380]   No, you know what?
[02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:07.980]   I use that as default SMS Messenger, am I Android phone?
[02:22:07.980 --> 02:22:08.980]   Facebook Messenger.
[02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:09.980]   Facebook Messenger is great.
[02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:14.180]   If you switch between phones, Facebook Messenger is really reliable.
[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:15.180]   Yes, it is.
[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:16.180]   It's a desktop, phone.
[02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:17.180]   It's everywhere.
[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:18.180]   It's federated.
[02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:22.420]   This is a real gap actually in what Google's up to in their strategy because they should
[02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:23.420]   own this.
[02:22:23.420 --> 02:22:25.500]   They should have Aloe or maybe Hangouts.
[02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:26.800]   They had it for a while.
[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:29.220]   They should have a standard across the board and they don't.
[02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:35.580]   So I use-- I have Hangouts and people Hangouts me, but on my Google 5 Pixel, I'm using Facebook
[02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:36.580]   Messenger.
[02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:39.940]   Do you think Google will ever see-- will ever actually build a social network?
[02:22:39.940 --> 02:22:41.420]   A social product that we all want to use?
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:42.620]   I don't know what's wrong with Google.
[02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:43.620]   There's something wrong with them.
[02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:45.620]   Maybe they're not very social company inside.
[02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:46.620]   Ahh.
[02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:47.620]   Whoa, hypothesis.
[02:22:47.620 --> 02:22:48.620]   That was not--
[02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:49.620]   Interesting hypothesis, though.
[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:52.180]   Maybe they don't get it because they don't like people.
[02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:55.060]   See, this is why I stopped talking right there.
[02:22:55.060 --> 02:22:57.660]   I think we should all stop talking because this has been a damn long show.
[02:22:57.660 --> 02:23:01.300]   But you know when you get these people together in a room, it's so much fun.
[02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:02.620]   I just didn't want to stop.
[02:23:02.620 --> 02:23:05.820]   You're doing an entire show just using emoji.
[02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:08.540]   We just put them on the screen.
[02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:09.540]   I wouldn't make it.
[02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:10.540]   It'd be horrible.
[02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:11.540]   I'd say right language.
[02:23:11.540 --> 02:23:12.540]   I love it.
[02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:13.540]   I love it.
[02:23:13.540 --> 02:23:14.540]   I love it.
[02:23:14.540 --> 02:23:15.540]   I love it.
[02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:16.540]   I love it.
[02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:17.540]   I love it.
[02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:18.540]   I love it.
[02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:19.540]   I love it.
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:20.540]   I love it.
[02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:21.540]   I love it.
[02:23:21.540 --> 02:23:22.540]   I love it.
[02:23:22.540 --> 02:23:23.540]   I love it.
[02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:24.540]   I love it.
[02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:25.540]   I love it.
[02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:26.540]   I love it.
[02:23:26.540 --> 02:23:27.540]   I love it.
[02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:28.540]   I love it.
[02:23:28.540 --> 02:23:29.540]   I love it.
[02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:30.540]   I love it.
[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:31.540]   I love it.
[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:32.540]   I love it.
[02:23:32.540 --> 02:23:33.540]   I love it.
[02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:34.540]   I love it.
[02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:35.540]   I love it.
[02:23:35.540 --> 02:23:36.540]   I love it.
[02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:37.540]   I love it.
[02:23:37.540 --> 02:23:38.540]   I love it.
[02:23:38.540 --> 02:23:39.540]   I love it.
[02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:40.540]   I love it.
[02:23:40.540 --> 02:23:41.540]   I love it.
[02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:42.540]   I love it.
[02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:43.540]   I love it.
[02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:44.540]   I love it.
[02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:45.540]   I love it.
[02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:46.540]   I love it.
[02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:47.540]   I love it.
[02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:48.540]   I love it.
[02:23:48.540 --> 02:23:49.540]   I love it.
[02:23:49.540 --> 02:23:50.540]   I love it.
[02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:51.540]   I love it.
[02:23:51.540 --> 02:23:52.540]   I love it.
[02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:53.540]   I love it.
[02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:54.540]   I love it.
[02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:55.540]   I love it.
[02:23:55.540 --> 02:23:56.540]   I love it.
[02:23:56.540 --> 02:23:57.540]   I love it.
[02:23:57.540 --> 02:23:58.540]   I love it.
[02:23:58.540 --> 02:23:59.540]   I love it.
[02:23:59.540 --> 02:24:00.540]   I love it.
[02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:01.540]   I love it.
[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:02.540]   I love it.
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:03.540]   I love it.
[02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:04.540]   I love it.
[02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:05.540]   I love it.
[02:24:05.540 --> 02:24:06.540]   I love it.
[02:24:06.540 --> 02:24:07.540]   I love it.
[02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:08.540]   I love it.

[02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:10.540]   I love it.
[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:11.540]   I love it.
[02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:12.540]   I love it.
[02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:13.540]   I love it.
[02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:14.540]   I love it.
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:15.540]   I love it.
[02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:16.540]   I love it.
[02:24:16.540 --> 02:24:17.540]   I love it.
[02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:18.540]   I love it.
[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:19.540]   I love it.
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:20.540]   I love it.
[02:24:20.540 --> 02:24:21.540]   I love it.
[02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:22.540]   I love it.
[02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:23.540]   I love it.
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:24.540]   I love it.
[02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:25.540]   I love it.
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:26.540]   I love it.
[02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:27.540]   I love it.
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:28.540]   I love it.
[02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:29.540]   I love it.
[02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:30.540]   I love it.
[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:31.540]   I love it.
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:32.540]   I love it.
[02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:33.540]   I love it.
[02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:34.540]   I love it.
