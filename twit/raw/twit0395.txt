[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.680]   And boy, I'm excited about this panel today.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.760]   Starting with John C. de Vorek to my right of channeldevorek.com.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.760]   He's got this is your new, this pistol thing.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   Is that your new?
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.360]   You know a kid got kicked out of kindergarten for doing that.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   For doing that I know.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   Isn't that sad?
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.360]   It's pathetic.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   The terrorists won, you know that.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   Oh yeah, well they won, yeah, they did.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.880]   There's a guy, he's a travel blogger, got kicked off United Airlines because he took
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.400]   a picture of his seat.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   What?
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   He took a picture of his seat.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.040]   I'm taking pictures and they're playing all the time.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.040]   This was a slight attendant took Umbridge.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   He said what do you mean?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.680]   Well he was taking a picture of her seat.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.360]   No, he thought she thought maybe he was taking a picture of her.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   Anyway she took Umbridge.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.600]   He said I'm not a terrorist.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.800]   They threw him off the flight.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.280]   Well you don't say I'm not a terrorist.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.800]   Well that's what I'm saying, the terrorists won.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.820]   Because if you can't, I mean if we live in such a paranoid world that that normal common
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.820]   sense is shot.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.820]   Then they won.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.320]   That's what they're trying to, that's what terrorism is about.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.880]   They're laughing, they're laughing in the caves they live in.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.680]   Mark, Mark, Jesus.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.760]   Mark Millian is also here.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   Nice to have you back Mark.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   Did they see you?
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   Did they see you?
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   Your, uh, your t-shirt says frightened rabbit.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   Did you grab it?
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   Is that a band?
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760]   Yeah, good rock band.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   They're coming here in a couple of weeks.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   Alright.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   I thought it was a statement about your emotional state or something.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   No, no.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   I feel good.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   Okay, good.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.360]   And I'm really pleased to welcome, well I was pleased to welcome both of you.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.760]   I don't want to, I don't want to imply that I'm not thrilled to have you guys.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.320]   But we've never had Horace Dettiyu on before and I'm very excited about having him on.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.800]   We talk about his Asimco blog all the time.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.200]   He's a great analyst of what's going on, particularly Apple.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.400]   Horace, welcome to Twitch.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   Good to have you.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.000]   I'm very, very happy to be here and thankful of the opportunity.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.320]   We were talking about the show.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   You were an analyst at Nokia for eight years and taken to the blog world to do something
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   similar.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.760]   Do you write a lot about Apple?
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.960]   But it's not just Apple, right?
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.120]   Oh, no, not at all.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.560]   In fact, Apple is only a sort of a metaphor actually.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.400]   I think it's what I'd like to really focus on is innovation.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.880]   And I went to business school, I studied under Christians and Clay Christians and the author
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.320]   of The Innovators Dilemma and several books thereafter.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.560]   That really inspired me to think about what does it mean to really change the world because
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.080]   technology is one thing, but really making it into a commercial success is what changes
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.240]   the world.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:48.000]   And so for me, the whole question in my mind has been ever since about 2000, how do companies
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.560]   succeed being serial innovators?
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.520]   Not just once, not just twice, but repeating the process over and over again.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.480]   And in that sense, there were very few examples of that happening.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.800]   We've seen it only with Sony perhaps back in the '70s and '80s.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.080]   We've seen it with maybe IBM back in the '50s and '60s.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.800]   But today, the only real company that's been able to do this more than a couple of times
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   has been Apple.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.840]   And so really, I like to take it apart, figure out what makes it tick.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.760]   And then actually, hopefully others can be more like Apple.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.240]   I recently wrote a story saying, why is it that people would like to copy Apple's products
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.880]   but don't want to copy the company itself, the product making engine?
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.840]   As I call it, it's like making a blockbuster manufacturing factory.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.640]   Why don't you want to own that factory?
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.840]   Few people actually do.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.360]   And that's a mystery to me.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.080]   And so explaining the process of innovation, what it takes to manage innovation, Apple is
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.640]   a great way to do so.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.000]   And that's why I focus a lot on it.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.960]   If they were to lose their way, certainly I think we could move on and talk about other
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.480]   companies as well.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.760]   And there are many times when I do actually dive deep into some other companies, I've
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.200]   done Samsung before, I've done Google, analyzing Google's Android business, for example.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.440]   I've looked, of course, at Nokia for many years.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.040]   I've looked at Microsoft as well.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.800]   And I sometimes even do a comparison of all of the above on one sort of massive in-depth
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.200]   chart trying to understand what makes them similar and what makes them different.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   It does raise the question.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.080]   Why if Apple is a roadmap, a game plan for innovation and successive innovation, why
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.240]   more people don't copy it?
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.560]   Did Samsung copy Apple?
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.320]   It seems like the courts thought they did.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.680]   Well, the product copying is one thing.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.760]   I mean, certainly Apple does it share of that as well.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.520]   And I think that's common in commonplace for in the industry actually for many decades
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.440]   that you build on sort of the building blocks that had came before.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.960]   But the question really is about the business practices of Apple.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.760]   So how do they make products?
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.440]   And another way, let me take Apple off the table for a minute and talk about another
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440]   company that actually has a repeatable process.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.800]   And that is actually Pixar.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.920]   Pixar figured out how to make blockbusters.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.200]   And not just one or two, but every movie's after the other.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.600]   And there are limits to how that happens.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.840]   For example, they can't make one every year.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.800]   They can't make three every year.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.280]   They have to make them after a couple of years.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.000]   And it takes a lot of time.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.800]   And they can't scale that process.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.040]   You can't turn Pixar into a thousand movies a year type of business, each one being a
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.200]   blockbuster.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.360]   And they know their limits.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   They know they can only make one every couple of years because the number of people needed,
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.560]   the time needed, the incubation period, and the refinement, the polishing, all that work
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.760]   it takes to make one of these massive, massive successes from Pixar is essentially embodied
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.960]   in that business model.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.800]   And that's what they were purchased by Disney for.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.600]   Now the question is, can you scale that innovation process to the technology space?
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.160]   Is that what Apple is doing?
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.960]   How do you take it into other industries, even beyond technology?
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.200]   You know, consumer products or what have you?
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.640]   That's really the mystery out there.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.480]   And I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.440]   I'm not sure I have it yet.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.840]   It's a really apt question.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.720]   It's one thing to copy the product, but that's not the chain.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.840]   Yeah, in fact, Tib Cook was just asked to sit at the conference.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.480]   It was two weeks ago with the Goldman Sachs conference, you know, what makes Apple innovative.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.760]   And he went on about the team he has and the fact that they're integrated and they know
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.120]   how to do software and hardware and services as well.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.560]   And that's certainly part of the story that they have integration and they have great
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.800]   staff, but the question again comes up, why doesn't anybody else do that?
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.680]   Why doesn't anybody become integrated?
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.560]   Why doesn't anybody hire the same team?
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.520]   In fact, you could probably poach them if you wanted to and you had enough money.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.840]   The answer is that it's actually probably more to this magic, more to the special sauce
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.000]   and we are led to believe.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.160]   One of the clues out there actually is that you have an internal division or something
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:23.520]   called Apple University that don't confuse that with iTunes U, iTunes University.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.840]   This is Apple University.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.160]   It's an internal training or MBA program, if you will, for their own employees, their
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.560]   own management to learn how to be an Apple manager.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.080]   And the question of how do you teach that and what is a curriculum?
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.680]   They brought in some pretty high powered people from business schools like Yale and Berkeley
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   to run it.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.160]   The head of Yale's business school took over that division and became the head of HR at
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   Apple.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.920]   Imagine the head of HR at Apple is a top academic from Yale.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.680]   Not something you would see in any other company.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.840]   No, it's obviously not prosecuting sexual harassment cases.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.600]   He's doing something else.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:10.160]   There was an interesting point counterpoint between John Gruber, Friday, and Tim Wu at
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.520]   the New Yorker.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:19.360]   Tim wrote an interesting article that says that open beats closed all the time and that
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.040]   Apple, which is the notorious counter example, is a closed system.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.600]   He wrote a column saying Apple needs somebody like Steve Jobs and that Apple without Jobs
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.560]   is falling back to Earth.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.040]   Does anybody seriously think that Pixar would be anything without John Lasseter?
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.040]   That's the question.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040]   Is it just cloning?
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.000]   Pixar, if you clone, Pixar took Lasseter out, which is kind of what you're suggesting.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.840]   How do they doubt if it would be successful?
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.000]   That's the crucial question.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.640]   I want to put this to you this way.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:57.520]   There's a lot of success stories and failures, not just in business, but in all kinds of human
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.800]   conditions, human enterprises.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.880]   Whether it's wars, government, you name it.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.000]   Who was responsible for the success of the US Army in Europe?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.120]   Some would say it was patents.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.200]   There was the system of the US Army.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.080]   Some would say there was a process at work.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.400]   There's always a combination of great people and the process.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.800]   You cannot say that it's only the individual that's responsible.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.840]   That's not giving credit at all to all the other individuals involved.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.760]   It's also not giving any credit to the fact that there's some magic involved in the way
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.360]   the thing is put together.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.440]   It's like telling people, "Why do you have a great piece of software?"
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.760]   It's like, "Well, because I have great input, because I have great algorithms, and because
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.640]   I have a great way of putting it all together and making it design."
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.960]   That's the thing about business is that there's too much emphasis, I think, on the magician
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   in charge.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.720]   We're not as much in understanding the process that is working behind the scenes.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.000]   That doesn't get a lot of credit.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.200]   I'm not saying, however, that process is everything and that if you took the great leadership
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.080]   out, it would still work.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.080]   That's not true either.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.120]   You have to pay attention to process.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.960]   You have to pay attention to the organizational structures that they put in place.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.480]   I call these, actually Christians initially, call these the resources, the processes and
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.600]   the priorities of a company.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.400]   Resources are things which walk out the door every day.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.120]   Processes are things that take years and sometimes decades to put together.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.360]   Priorities are why you do certain things.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.040]   Priorities, for example, are very, very hard to change, almost never change in the company.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.240]   That's the business model.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.960]   That's the entire what they call the DNA.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.520]   I don't focus so much on the DNA, but I do try to understand the processes involved.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.920]   It's interesting that processes that are tuned to innovation are actually quite rare.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.120]   Most processes companies use are trying to actually maintain what they already have, not
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.440]   to create something new or to destroy what they have in order to replace it.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.760]   To step back a little bit to this debate about open and closed, what I found interesting
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:13.200]   is the analogy of open closed is very similar to another analogy of integrated and modular.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.280]   Integrated is very analogous to being so-called closed.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   A company like Ford, which made the Model T in the 1920s, was using essentially an integrated
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.200]   approach in that they would really own the entire value chain.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.840]   It wasn't open in a sense, they would allow suppliers to give them certain pieces and
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.840]   then they would provide a standard interface for things like parts and engines and so on.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.560]   Rather, they chose to design everything themselves.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.960]   What happened is later on, General Motors had a completely different approach and they
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.600]   were much more successful because they wouldn't create just a single model, but they were
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.800]   able to create a huge multitude of models and they were able to do so very rapidly.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.560]   They could make a new car every year, which was unheard of before then.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.080]   They had a flexible manufacturing model to allow this to happen.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.480]   What we saw happen in the auto industry already by the 1930s is that a switch from so-called
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.120]   integrated to more modular was the way to go.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.400]   As the industry matured, it flipped from being integrated to being modular.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.200]   This happens over and over again.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.280]   When you come up with something new, something completely different that the market has never
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.960]   seen before, you've got to go about it in an integrated way.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.160]   This is why when we first saw computers, they were integrated, they became modular.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.360]   When the computers then became smaller, they started out integrated and then became modular.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.640]   When the web came, it started out being integrated in the sense that you had to have the same
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.040]   company building, the browsing and the same company building, the operating system like
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.640]   we saw with Microsoft.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.800]   Then Google came and Firefox came and so on.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.200]   You're seeing this process over and over again.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.480]   You can't say that open always wins.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:04.400]   Open wins in the end of the late stages of an industry once it has reached a maturity
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.960]   where modularity actually works.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.920]   That solves a different problem for the user than just working.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:18.280]   It has to work in a much more expansive way, like it has to work as a convenience rather
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.280]   than just utility.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.680]   I want to say he's got a great future ahead of him as a consultant.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.600]   I've heard all this kind of thing before and this is a beauty.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.440]   That's what management wants to hear is it's not the person that's the process that there's
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.000]   DNA you could communicate.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.760]   We're going to see the results of that great experiment at Apple because the person's gone.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.280]   We saw it at DNA.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.800]   We saw it at DNA once when Steve Jobs left the first time.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.320]   Spindler actually multiplied the income by 10.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   Not Spindler.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   They didn't have any money.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.880]   When Scali left, he couldn't keep his pace up.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.960]   He told me he should be going even bigger.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.800]   They started bringing in the third generation, a fourth generation, Spindler and then the
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.280]   guy from Emilio.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.960]   I think it started caving.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.440]   That's how it ended up, process or no process.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.680]   It doesn't hold up unless you have talent at the top.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.600]   I think it's a great idea of having a machine but it's still people who have borne anything.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.760]   That's what all the investors do.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.180]   There's not a VC in the world that would invest in a process.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.200]   They invest in the founders don't they?
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:22.320]   It seems like the product generations are even shortening to maturity now at this point where
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.760]   Apple was able to control personal computers with the Mac for maybe eight years when the
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.720]   first Macintosh came out following the Apple II.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:40.560]   Now we're five, six years into the modern touchscreen smartphone and Samsung is clearly
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.560]   the dominant force.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.400]   It's not Apple.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:49.080]   Apple's new innovator, Dilemma, seems to be, they have to create a new product category.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.440]   It's all about the watch now.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.560]   One thing, by the way, just to note, Apple was not the leader in the smartphone space except
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.320]   for one or two quarters in its whole history.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.080]   It was Nokia that was the leader for many, many years.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.960]   John was a big E71 fan.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.200]   You were a Nokia fan.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   You were a long-term fan.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   Blackberry was big in the United States.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.000]   Really, Apple never was number one except I think the only category they've ever been
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.080]   number one is MP3 players.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.400]   That's really funny when you think about that.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   It's true though.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.640]   I mean, there may be number one in terms of profit and somewhat in sales but that is
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.600]   also potentially transient.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.680]   The thing to note is that this is not the game they play, the volume game.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.120]   It's unusual in fact that they get to this kind of number that they have today.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.760]   But yeah, that's the crucial dilemma.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.320]   When you are integrated, typically you cannot serve billions of people.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.680]   It's just very, very hard to scale.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.320]   Let's take a break because there's more to talk about.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.360]   Horace Dettios, it's so great to have you.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.120]   Thank you for masonco.com.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.640]   Mark Millian, Bloomberg Business Week, John C. Devorak, Channel Devorak.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   No agenda show.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.240]   By the way, I have discs for anyone who wants the best of January show.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.000]   You're giving out discs or will you be selling them as people who know the lobby?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   No, no, no.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   They get free disc with it.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Somebody send them to us and say, "We should do that.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.080]   We should have a little table, a little cart table out in the lobby.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.080]   You could sell this."
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   That'd be perfect.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.080]   That'd be good.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   There we go.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080]   Everybody wants it.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.440]   John will be passing those out.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.120]   He's a big fan of a no agenda show.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   He's just going to leave them in a stack where there's a rush.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.280]   Don't all get them at once.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.000]   We're dropping most of them off into Korea.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.160]   You know, in Korea.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.400]   No agenda show is huge in Korea.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   No, no, no.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   It's like the little parachute.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.520]   No, if you've been to the hand-cook supermarket down in Sunnyvale, it's a Korean place.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   It's fantastic.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.560]   If you've never been there, you should go.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.560]   We should go.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.560]   We're going to be down there.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.560]   You should check it out.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.560]   It's huge.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.560]   Well, they don't have...
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.560]   They have...
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.640]   You know, we get the free newspapers on the free stuff and there's little bins and stuff.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.040]   In the Koreans, I guess, don't do any of that.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.560]   They just hand out discs.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.560]   Oh, wow.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.480]   There's stacks of all kinds of discs.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.480]   Like AOL.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   Exactly.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.120]   This is what we got by AOL disc.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.640]   It's 60 grand hours.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.480]   So John and I actually are going down to San Jose.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.760]   We're going to be speaking at the Radio Inc. convergence conference.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.560]   This is going to be really interesting.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.200]   We're going in front of a lot of radio executives to tell them why their business is doing.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   Why they're doomed.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.200]   And we have so much respect for radio executives.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   It can break some of those discs.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   I will.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   I'm going to bring a pile.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   Here's the future.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   No agenda show.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.840]   Actually, I will throw them into the audience.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   Maybe I can do it.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.240]   Maybe they'll slow them down as they attack us.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.240]   Yeah, it could be.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.440]   They're giving us all of 35 minutes to do a keynote, two of us.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.240]   It's going to be interesting.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.320]   Yeah, we're going to add Lib the whole.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:47.200]   We were originally scheduled to be the keynote at the beginning of the conference and I noticed.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.080]   Yeah, they bumped us for somebody else.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.520]   They moved us down the list.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:57.120]   I think they figured out finally that these guys really are trying to kill radio.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.840]   Now, Tim Draper of Draper, Jervison Fisher.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   Yeah, and Draper knows nothing.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   Righting a right-hand.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.080]   Not thing, by the way, I know Draper.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.520]   He knows nothing about new media or radio.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.160]   But he's a visionary and venture capitalist behind many of the top brands you know today.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.000]   And then we got these statler and Waldorf of tech to Vorek and LaPorte to talk after
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   that.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   What times does his think?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   I'm sure he's at one.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   We should go see him.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Yeah, and then we can blast it.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.800]   And he won't have any retort.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   He'll play at least.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   Very entertaining on stage.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   Now, Draper's okay.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.080]   I've heard him speak before, but he'll leave right afterwards immediately.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.600]   Yeah, because he doesn't.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   So then we can say whatever.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.200]   He does his little song on stage.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.800]   Have you seen him speak on stage for me?
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   Does the song he's on?
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   No, I have not seen this song.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.280]   He's on pretty much every keynote that he does.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   I wonder when he started that.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.720]   You should get a little song.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   No, I'm not going to get a song together.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.080]   They do a lip sync sometimes.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   Okay.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   All right.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.800]   If you missed, we had a good week on Twitter.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   Why don't you think Chad, this was a particularly unusually good week?
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   No idea.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.360]   So this week, we did lots of things.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.360]   Let's take a look.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.360]   Maybe there's something you missed.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.960]   And then right after that, we'll find out what Tom Merritt is going to get in the weekend.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.400]   We could keep talking about how good.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   Oh, you're not ready.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   This week is.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.600]   Can't you rewind the tape?
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.200]   It has been a really good week.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.200]   He was live.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   Tom Merritt.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.960]   No, we're talking about the promo.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   Tom's live, of course.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.960]   No, this promo.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.960]   Oh, wait.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.960]   What do you think of the house ad, John?
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.720]   I never put the house ad in this early.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.360]   I thought I'd give it some sea or jinx.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   It's cursed.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.360]   It's cursed.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   It's my fault.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.360]   I'm distracted.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   Here we go.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.360]   Okay.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.840]   So this week, real exciting stuff, everyone.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   Take a look.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.880]   Previously on Twitter, triagulation.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.520]   To get elected, you need a lot of money.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.880]   And the best way to get a lot of money is to ask rich people for it.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.800]   And the best way to get them to continue giving you money is to pass laws that make
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   the richer.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.840]   And they get to use that money to get you reelected.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.200]   Lather, rinse, repeat, and three or four election cycles later.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.160]   That's a felony to find out whether or not your phone is spying on you.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.680]   Matt break weekly.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:03.320]   From that bastion of journalistic verisimilitude, the New York Post comes this exclusive.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.160]   NYPD forms dedicated team to catch thieves who steal iPhones and iPads.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.160]   Before you buy.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.600]   I took some video of my dog, Tibs, running around in the grass.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.120]   And I also did some low light inside shots.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.000]   And this camera performed really well.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   All about Android.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.280]   The fact that you have in your marketing, you need to name something truly on your mind.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.440]   Just speak to the fact that you're lying.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.800]   Like you're lying.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.120]   And like now we know.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   To it.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.400]   Now, where'd I put my Android?
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.960]   Hey, thanks Leo.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.280]   Here's a look at some of the things happening in the week ahead.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.520]   We'll keep an eye on the news on tech news today.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.600]   Starting Monday, March 4th at the Love Festival is happening in San Francisco.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.920]   Also that same day kicks off.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.120]   The Freedom to Connect conference in Silver Springs, Maryland.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.840]   Tuesday, March 5th begins Seabit in Hanover, Germany.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   Friday, March 8th.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.240]   South by Southwest.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.600]   Interactive kicks off in Austin, Texas.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.240]   And Saturday, March 9th.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.800]   The last time code camp 19.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.680]   It happens at the New England Research and Development or Nerd campus of Microsoft.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.160]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   Back to you Leo.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.160]   Thank you Tom Merritt.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.480]   I don't ever run that at the beginning of the show.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.880]   And I just thought for a change, we should give them a chance at the beginning of the
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.720]   show before everybody's tuned out.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.720]   What?
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.320]   This is the kind of thing that makes them tune out.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   Oh darn.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.760]   I didn't think of that.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.920]   Our show today brought to you by sharefile.com.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.560]   This is a great solution I have really been using the heck out of.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.640]   And no matter what your business, you probably will want to too.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.920]   As you know, in business, effective communication is everything.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.800]   Unfortunately, these days sending email with attachments is not done.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.600]   You get the bounce back, you lack security.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   Security email is not secure.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.040]   It's like setting a postcard.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.640]   So I've been using and I recommend for any business, sharefile.com.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:00.120]   If you go to sharefile.com, you can see why sharefile is such a great difference.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.560]   Citrix understands the challenge of business and they built a better solution for business.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   It's why millions of accountants, lawyers and other business professionals rely on sharefile.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.880]   Very easy for anyone to use.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.520]   You could send files of almost any size securely.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.880]   You could track the progress of your files.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.680]   Notifications are automatically set when the files are open and you can control who has
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.840]   access by using tools like password protection.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.080]   You can even sign and edit files for streamlined collaboration.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.400]   Plus with sharefile, you can access files anywhere.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.520]   Laptop, smart, phone, tablet.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.480]   I want you to try sharefile free.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.400]   I've been so happy with it.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.200]   I'd like to give you a chance to try it for 30 days.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.040]   Visit sharefile.com.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.040]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.040]   There's nothing to lose.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.960]   Just click the microphone and enter Twitch.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.880]   You will want to select your industry because sharefile customizes for a really big number
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.880]   of industries.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.320]   That's one of the things I particularly like about it.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.400]   For instance, HIPAA compliant if you're in the medical industry.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.840]   So choose your industry.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.120]   Use the Twitter offer code and enjoy sharefile free for 30 days.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120]   Look at this.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:07.280]   Engineering, planning, event planning, photography, printing, publishing, software, tech services.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.280]   I love it.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   Sharefile.com.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.560]   Use the offer code, "Twit."
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.720]   Did we talk about on the show, taking the picture of the seat?
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   Yes, we did.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   Okay.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   Was that on the show?
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   I thought it was before the show.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   I can't remember now.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   I can't remember now.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.320]   That's a problem with talking at all.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.320]   Before the show.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   All right, I got a story.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.360]   Evernote gets hacked.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.000]   Evernote did something very aggressive that maybe, I don't know, this is the new thing
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   to do.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Last pasted this when they got hacked.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.480]   Twitter did it when they got hacked.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.760]   They said immediately we were hacked, it happened February 28th, within a day or two,
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.240]   they said we've been hacked.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:54.680]   They got names, email addresses and passwords, but our password database was properly encrypted
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.640]   using hashes and salt, heavily salted hash, which is a delicious breakfast.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.440]   It is, especially the naked.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.640]   But so even though there really was no risk, they said no data was compromised, no user
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.640]   data was compromised.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.960]   But we're going to reset everybody's password just in case.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   This is what Twitter did.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   Yeah, it's annoying.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.440]   It's the new thing to do.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:20.520]   Just in case, even though there's no harm done, we're going to reset everybody's password.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.680]   Do you think that's overreaction?
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.760]   Or is this now the new norm?
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.720]   I agree it's annoying, but I think it's probably good security hygiene.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:36.600]   It's the new thing is admit everything, because banks for years just pretend nothing was
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.600]   going on.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   We weren't hacked.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600]   What's that?
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.480]   That's why they need the excuse to charge 18% interest.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.680]   Hash passwords can be decrypted.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.800]   If the hackers were targeting a few people in particular, it's probably likely that over
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.720]   time they could decrypt those passwords.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.320]   Well, because of rainbow tables and so forth, merely hashing is insufficient.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.160]   But hashing with enough salt is pretty secure.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.440]   So I'm likely that they're going to get...
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.560]   Anyway, they've reset the passwords.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   The real...
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.800]   I'll tell you, the real security issue has nothing to do with that.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.840]   It has to do with, if I use the same password on Evernote that I use on 15 other sites,
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.160]   if they did get my password, that might be more of a problem.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.200]   But that would assume that they would know what the sites are that you're...
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.760]   Well, they try them all.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.760]   They don't know...
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.760]   Well, maybe.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.200]   You know, if you use Monkey123 as a password, which I know you do...
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   I do.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.920]   And then I get that password through Evernote.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.720]   Maybe I didn't get any Evernote data, but now I can try logging into Twitter, Hotmail.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.440]   Yeah, but I don't use the same username and everything.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.040]   I can guess your username.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   What?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.480]   Devorect@devorect.org?
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   No.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   Yes.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   No.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.480]   No.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   John@devorect.org?
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.480]   Well, that's my...
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   John May.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   Do you see Devorect?
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   Well, a lot of times it's just your email address.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   Well, I don't write any...
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480]   There it is.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.120]   Spammed after the show goes onto the downloads.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.120]   I know.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.120]   I never get spammed.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   He gets no spam.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.120]   I get no spam.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   It's a remarkable...
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   That's because I use a system?
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.120]   Feet of Nature.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.360]   C-T-Y-M-E.com.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.080]   It's a plug for the service.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.880]   You haven't plugged them in a long time.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   I just did.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.760]   What does that stand for?
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   Computer Time.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.760]   Computer Time posting.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.760]   My posting.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:19.320]   Anyway, I admire Evernote for being aggressive about this.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.160]   I just wonder, this is what everybody does right now.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.360]   Yeah, it says I get no spam on a computer time web.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   With a picture of John.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.360]   And by the way, that website...
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.440]   I just want to point out that computer time website, they haven't redesigned that since
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.440]   1990.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.440]   He is a traditionalist.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.440]   It's actually a ready line for us.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.440]   I have a very ready line for us.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.120]   I haven't seen rainbow bars.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.480]   He doesn't have a cat running across the bottom like he used to.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.480]   But the rest of it is good.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.800]   There's actually fish with feet.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.400]   Right next to the church reality.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.960]   Oh yeah, that's his church.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.600]   C-T-Y-M-E.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.200]   The great thing about C-T-Y-M-E.com is that Mark, the ghost...
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   What happened?
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.320]   I'm just showing the sight.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.960]   Oh yeah, the great thing about this guy.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.960]   I'm surprised it's not cycling rainbows since the release.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.480]   He had that, but he took it off.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.720]   So he will not give the government anything.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   He already said that.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.720]   Yeah, he says it.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   I don't care.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.720]   He says, "Screw it.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.960]   Throw me a G. I am not going to give it..."
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.320]   Because he does all the sights or all these radical organizations.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.240]   I missed a bit though, this little email icon.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.040]   He really cool if the door was opening and then the mail was flying into it and the door
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   goes.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   That would have been really good.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.560]   Yeah, I've talked to Mark about this.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.080]   He refuses to change it.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.960]   Because it's more secure this way the way he sees it.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.160]   It's like Steve Gibson says, "No Java."
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.560]   Steve Gibson, same thing.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   No JavaScript, no Java.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.960]   No, you ask it for trouble.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   I write everything in assembly languages.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   Yeah, just the way this guy is too.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   No, I...
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.680]   Thank God bless him.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   Thank God.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.040]   These are the prototypical...
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.680]   Protogeeks, the original geeks.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.600]   Yeah, he's been around forever.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.000]   Ones that started it all.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.520]   Does he have a neck beard?
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.680]   I haven't seen him for a while.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.480]   Bradley Manning pleads guilty.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.920]   Yeah, he's beaten enough.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.760]   Yeah, he says...
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.440]   It's actually an interesting article from Yochai Benkler at MIT in the New Republic.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:23.760]   The dangerous logic of the Bradley Manning case.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.760]   Is it...
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.360]   All right, just saying he pleaded guilty.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.960]   He says he had a good reason for doing it.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.640]   He was really dismayed by what the army was up to.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:40.280]   He felt it was a patriotic thing to be a whistleblower.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.360]   Well, it started, apparently.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:48.120]   The last story I heard was that he had known that they had tried to do a Freedom of Information
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.520]   Act to get that helicopter video, which is the first thing he did.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.280]   Right, and that was the guy saying, "Hey, there's a night guy walking around.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.280]   Let's kill him."
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.280]   Taking pot shots, people on the street.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.280]   And then shooting guys.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.520]   Yeah, this guy's gonna help the other guy.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.520]   Let's kill him.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:05.560]   So he thought that was abhorrent, and so he decided to just throw that video out there.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:11.240]   Benkler says the prosecution case seems designed quite simply to terrorize future national security
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.240]   whistleblowers.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   That's probably true.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.240]   I'd like to know why he...
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.240]   Oh, you know, why he...
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   The example of him.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.440]   Why he couldn't shut up about it.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.440]   He didn't get caught for the helicopter thing, and so he says, "Well, if he didn't catch
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.200]   me on this, I'll do something else."
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   Then he bragged about it.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   I...
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   You know, he just brought...
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.240]   Yeah, but they're bringing charges like aiding the enemy, punishable by death.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.240]   They're looking...
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   Yeah, good luck at that.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.240]   I mean, they are...
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   So it's a capital offense.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.120]   It's not gonna happen.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.360]   It reminds me a little bit of the erm...
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.880]   Aaron Schwartz case, where just this prosecutorial...
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.840]   Well, they did manage to kill him.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.680]   Overreaching, you know?
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.320]   Do you don't want to be an enemy of the state?
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.320]   God no.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.960]   Heaven for Fend.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.160]   That's the lesson, isn't it?
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.360]   We discussed this on no agenda show every...
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.360]   I'm sure you do.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.160]   I don't know why I'm signing it up.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.160]   You shouldn't be bringing it up.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.160]   Stop listening to the Twitter.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.160]   Go listen to Noah, Jen.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.160]   We should need technique.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.160]   Steve Mann, you know who he is.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.320]   The MIT guy who, for years, wore computers around.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.240]   He was the guy who really invented wearable computing.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.240]   He's got some warnings.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.240]   I think I met him once.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.920]   Yeah, you couldn't miss him.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.360]   I mean, back in '95, he's wearing this outfit around.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.760]   It looks like he's carrying a Pentium 90 PC on his waist.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.400]   You know, that are a royal typewriter.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.560]   And he's got an antenna on his head.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   Very...
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.960]   Well, he's talking to Google about Project Glass.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:37.440]   And he says, "Be careful because I've been, for a long time, I've been saying Project
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.280]   Glasses like Steve Martin in the jerk, those glasses that...
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.520]   Remember, he invented the handle that you pulled the glasses off and made millions of
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.680]   dollars until people sued him because they all ended up cross-eyed because of the handle?
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.640]   This guy says that could happen.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   He says, "Terraining people to look into this screen."
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.240]   Yeah, yeah, he might be right.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.320]   Long-term consequences to your vision, then you might think...
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   I think it's possible.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.720]   Google could end up with a bunch of cross-eyed users.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   Just like the guys that worked there.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   Just like the jerk.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   He said, "For instance, you...
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   It's like the joke."
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.160]   No, because I had a different joke.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.560]   I said, "Just like the jerk."
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.320]   You said, "Just like the guys that work at Google."
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   Should we have a vote?
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   Yeah, we would never.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   Should we have a vote?
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.320]   I would never.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.320]   I don't know.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:32.080]   But the vision scientist who did the experiment of wearing a prism, his name George Stratton,
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.400]   on his glasses in the 1890s, that turned the world upside down.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.240]   We actually do see the world upside down, but the brain reverses it.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.520]   Stratton put these glasses on to turn it around.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.800]   He said, "Within two days he adjusted, it was completely normal.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.440]   Everything looked upright to him."
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:54.200]   So you adjusted very quickly, but after he took the glasses off, it took a long time for
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.920]   his vision to return to normal.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.400]   He said everything...
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.160]   He said his vision had a bewildering air.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.800]   A bet of death.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.440]   And this guy, man says that in fact, this has exactly been my experience that you can
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.520]   adjust fairly quickly, but to readjust after wearing something like Google Glass for a
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.280]   long period of time could be very challenging.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.240]   He wears glasses that let him see the world in HDR, which is kind of interesting, with
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   video feeds.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:28.600]   Boy, we're really getting the conversation going on.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   It's a...
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   All right.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   What's like about Glass?
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.360]   Are you guys getting a plan to get one?
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.360]   I'm on the list.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.960]   I got the little paperweight.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   Number 737.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.760]   They haven't charged me yet.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.240]   $1,500.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:46.040]   But I'm completely skeptical about wearable computing of all kinds, including Apple watches
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.040]   and...
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.720]   The sun says this is going to be the greatest thing.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.720]   He says, if you were...
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.320]   He's like your age.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.360]   The greatest thing, because you can do all kinds of things with it.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.360]   I said, "What?"
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.360]   And he can...
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   Yeah, I like what.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.560]   Take video of your balloon trip.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.760]   You can take videos and demand or...
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   I don't know what.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.640]   Horace, isn't this stimulated by the intense demand on companies to come up with the next
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.200]   big thing, whether people want it or not?
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.000]   Well, it is to some degree.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   The problem I see though is that we're trying to see what the technology can deliver.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.960]   And trying to really just find the problems with the technology.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:26.080]   It's like you have a tool and you're trying to find the solution or the problem that
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   it can solve.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   Exactly.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.000]   And it's backwards.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   The right way to do it is sort of...
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.720]   Let me put it this way.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.240]   Watching the video, I got the impression that this solves the problem of people who are
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.160]   very, very active physically.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.800]   How many of us really have these sort of needs of being...
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.680]   Yeah, it's too much trouble to hold the camera while I'm jumping out of an airplane.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.280]   So I have some glasses that will do more.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   Right.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.320]   And there are a lot of problems we have that are not solved.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.400]   And these problems are usually basic things like, "I want to be feeling comfortable.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.440]   I want to be somehow feeling that my family loves me."
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.880]   These are real problems.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:15.440]   The idea of having more technology solving this idea of hyperactive lifestyles is not
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.720]   really the mainstream problem.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:24.160]   I think the really innovation that's going to be rewarded will be on things like, "Well,
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.240]   let's convert our computers from being tools to being companions.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.920]   Let's convert our computers from being utilitarian to being enlightening."
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.920]   Wow.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.840]   And that is really...
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.920]   These are human needs.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:46.160]   It's like imagine hiring a computer to be your advisor.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.880]   And you wouldn't think of the computer as you do today, but it would be sort of almost
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.480]   personified.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.480]   That is the future.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.400]   And I think that we're getting there bit by bit.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.760]   And I think Google is as good a chance as anyone.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:06.560]   But I think that the idea of technology being packaged as a tool is pass-safe, frankly.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.400]   And I think we got to move on.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.360]   I wrote a column recently about it suggesting the possibility that this is actually just
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   a joke.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   It's a hoax.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.960]   Well, what was it that Larry...
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.120]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   Sergey said it Ted, that it's emasculating.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.720]   A nasty thing to look at your phone.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   To look at your phone?
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   It makes it sound like a joke.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   Yeah, no.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   I know.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720]   I thought that was a very odd...
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   You're looking at your phone.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   You should be looking through glass.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.920]   You should be rubbing an inanimate object.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   You are girly.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.320]   How would you be rubbing it all day, the object?
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.920]   It's just very suggestive.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:46.560]   I mean, maybe glass isn't even designed for a mainstream audience.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:52.120]   Maybe it is designed for ex-saters.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.920]   Is this a special case of the innovators dilemma that you become very successful than you only
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.280]   design solutions for the 1%?
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.400]   I mean, look at the Chromebook Pixel.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   Who is that for?
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.400]   Another example.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   That's right.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   Yeah, less than 1%.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   It's another 1%.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.320]   It's not even the right aspect of any ratio that's not even...
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.320]   It's 3x2.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.400]   It's 3x2.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   It's crazy.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.160]   All right, Horace, sounds like he wants to defend the Pixel.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   No, I...
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.600]   Well, I mean, it's in some ways it's the right approach.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.880]   I mean, the idea of having a...
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.560]   What we used to call your member on network computers, right?
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.520]   I mean, this is not a new idea.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.760]   Yeah, but what if you design a solid gold thin client?
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.360]   Does that make it better somehow?
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.600]   And how is it the right approach?
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:41.920]   It's a 3x2 aspect ratio thing that does nothing and it's $1,300 is overpriced.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   That's not the right approach.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.920]   The right approach is cheap.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.920]   Well, they make...
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.920]   Exactly.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   They make cheap.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.920]   Yeah, that's what they should stick with.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.760]   Why are they making a $1,300 netbook or net...
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.320]   The disruptive thing to do would be to go in at the low end and make it available to
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.840]   people who don't have computers today.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.640]   I think that's the job of smartphones to some degree.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:07.560]   But if they wanted to really try to change the landscape of computing, they would have
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.040]   to probably solve the problem at the low end, not at $1,300.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   There must be...
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   I mean, these guys are not dumb.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.640]   There must be a reason for glass.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.880]   There must be a reason for the pixel.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.480]   Was there a reason for the Nexus Q?
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   The Q.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   There's another winner.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.480]   There's all you connect to your TV and those doings.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.240]   Just because they're not dumb doesn't mean that everything they do is...
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   They're not gods.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.240]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   I think Sergase can...
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.120]   The nicest thing I got is three jets and maybe it makes a difference.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.960]   I mean, the only good thing you can imagine is that they're learning.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.760]   These are the types of products you do to get your team working together and figure out
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.360]   how to make hardware.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.320]   Again, because it's actually harder to make cheap stuff than to make expensive stuff,
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:56.120]   one thing I sometimes bring up is it's harder to engineer fiat than it is to engineer a
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.120]   Ferrari.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.880]   Let's think about it because the Ferrari, you're only going to make a couple of hundred of
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   them.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.080]   To engineer the fiat, you got to work it out.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:07.920]   How is it going to be manufactured in huge quantities and sold to dealer networks and
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.760]   service and so on?
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.240]   That's a completely different problem.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.080]   You might actually start by building the Ferrari's because you're going to actually work with
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.080]   a small team.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.880]   You're going to learn all the problems and then you're going to scale and actually make
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.760]   the cheap stuff later.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.760]   I don't know.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.960]   That's the only nice thing I can say about this approach.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.840]   Is Chrome OS a success?
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.480]   No.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.240]   I agree.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.800]   You could talk to some specific segments.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:44.280]   It reminds me of the Newton, actually, which is certain segments made sense.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.640]   For instance, the Newton never made sense to anybody.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.120]   Okay, they'll go the slate.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.440]   The early stylists tablets made sense in certain vertical markets on the factory floor
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.120]   or maybe a physician.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:03.360]   It seems like the Pixel makes sense if you want to make a dashboard for a CEO.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.760]   You don't want a cheesy netbook, but you don't want anything too sophisticated because
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.800]   the guy's a moron.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.760]   You want it to look nice.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.960]   It's a specialty product.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.360]   Glass similarly.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.280]   I don't know.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.320]   That's what it feels like for me.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   I don't see that.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.400]   I don't see that the Chrome OS has a market.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.240]   There's a market in education for a $20 a month cheap laptop that the kid can't really
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.200]   get into trouble with.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.640]   That's one use for it.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.160]   These are very specialized markets.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.640]   The Chrome OS always seems to be, I mean, first of all, they announced it like a year
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:40.040]   or two before it actually became available on any products.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.880]   But the team itself always seems to be about a year or two behind every trend.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:49.200]   They released the original Chromebook a year after people stopped buying netbooks.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.520]   Yeah, the Chrome box.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.520]   Chrome box.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.520]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.520]   I have like a Mac mini with the Chrome OS on it.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.840]   Yeah, it doesn't do anything.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.240]   You know, most people do with these things.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.800]   They put Linux on it.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   They say, OK, thanks.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   Yeah, but you still need some storage.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   Thanks for the hardware.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   I'm going to put Linux on it.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   You need a lot of storage.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   That's right.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.760]   And I think the Pixel is coming out now a year after people have lost interest in--
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760]   Ultra books.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.760]   Well, this is an Ultra book.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.760]   No, Ultra books.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   It's supposed to be on a lost interest.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.760]   I have one.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   I like little things.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.760]   Is it a Chrome book?
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.760]   No, an Ultra book.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.760]   Ultra books are different than Chrome--
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.760]   I think Chrome books is like a netbook.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.760]   I think a netbook is the word you're looking for.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.760]   No, no, no, no.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   It's just a standalone machine.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.760]   It's got a solid state memory.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.640]   Yeah, but it's got a hard disk, as it were.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.560]   It's got a solid state hard disk.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   It's stand alone.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.000]   It's got Windows or runs Linux.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.800]   And you can work with it without being hooked to the internet.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.320]   Actually, this is a lot different.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.880]   After using Windows 8 on this Acer for a while, I wouldn't mind Chrome OS.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.880]   It might be better.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.320]   Well, you're going to get--
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   Windows 8 is a short--
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320]   Windows 8 is a short--
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.320]   --moushed of the way you keep--
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   I know.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   I have to--
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.800]   You keep poking at the thing.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   I don't know.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.840]   I don't know.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.880]   You should run a classic desktop, whatever that thing is, and get rid of this.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880]   Yeah, a classic shell.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   Classic shell.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.480]   You'll like it a lot better.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   You'll see.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.560]   So why is Sergey Brin going after-- by the way, and this is the other thing that puzzles
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.640]   me about Chrome OS because Google has a very credible operating system.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.640]   It's called Android.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.200]   It seems to be taking over the world.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.440]   I don't understand why they don't make a computer.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.000]   Make an Android computer.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.200]   Make a pixel that runs Android.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.680]   That would be something I'd buy.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.680]   Well, I told you it's--
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.680]   You got 250,000 apps?
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.680]   You got 250,000 apps.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.320]   I don't think Andy Rubin is interested in the computer market.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.520]   So he's saying it's Andy that's keeping that from happening.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.520]   It's Andy.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.520]   Andy Rubin?
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.360]   Andy and Sergey are going to get in a fight because Sergey said that Andy's product is
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.360]   emasculating.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.800]   I mean, he has to be calling him out.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   He's calling Andy out for being--
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.080]   This is a company that makes a lot of money on Android, right?
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.920]   Andy's calling-- you have tons.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.560]   And they also spend a lot of money on a phone company.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   They bought Motorola for the patents.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.560]   Yeah, they don't see--
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   You know, even-- this is another one.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.000]   Google even said-- who was it that said at Google?
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Was it Larry?
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.240]   Yeah, those Motorola phones are crap.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.240]   What the hell?
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.720]   They're CFO and a premium--
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   It's a CFO.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.760]   Yeah, we're not really that proud of what they're not--
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   They're not really--
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.760]   They're not really-- what is with this company?
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.760]   I don't know.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.760]   They're wacky.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.040]   I like it.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.160]   They're different.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.800]   They're standing around just--
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.160]   It says-- I wonder if I have the video of Sergey saying this.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.560]   He's wearing those things.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.040]   He thinks rubbing a featureless piece of glasses
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.360]   more emasculating than wearing the Borg glasses?
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   Yeah, the Borg.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.360]   He always had those glasses.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.160]   He's a very macho.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.160]   He looks so macho.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.360]   He looks like a robot.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.080]   Roborg are not macho.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.360]   They're disgusting.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.080]   They're horrible beasts.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.880]   All right.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.480]   Onward.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:47.920]   Onward.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.520]   Teens are tiring a Facebook.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.680]   We find this out, in fact, from Facebook.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:45:05.320]   So it starts with a post from-- who was it that left Facebook?
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.640]   I don't have his name in front of me.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.800]   You guys know what I'm talking about?
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.080]   No, I don't know anything about it.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   You know, Blake Ross.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.240]   Blake Ross, the director of product at Facebook.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.360]   Quits.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.960]   Why?
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.200]   Well, and this is my question.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.160]   Was he making a joke?
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.080]   Because he said why.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.520]   He posted a letter on his profile page, which he later
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.000]   took down, saying, I'm leaving to become a Forbes writer, which
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.240]   is a questionable career choice.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.200]   But OK.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.400]   Because-- oh, no.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.840]   I'm leaving because of Forbes writer.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.960]   There, that makes more sense.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.040]   Because of Forbes writer.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.120]   Because of Forbes writer asked his son's best friend, Todd,
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.960]   if Facebook was still cool, and the friend said no,
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.760]   and plus none of his friends think so either,
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.640]   even Lila, who used to love it.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.840]   And this journalism made me--
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.200]   He's 12.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.120]   What is this?
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.760]   And this journalism-- I think it's a joke.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.840]   That's tongue in cheek.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.760]   And this journalism maybe reconsidered
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.040]   the long-term viability of the company.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.200]   Now he says, no, I'm just trying to do things.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.360]   And I think that this was a hand-handed joke.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.280]   But now everybody's saying, oh, maybe if Ross is leaving
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.840]   because his Facebook's no longer hip, maybe it's over.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.680]   And Facebook even admitted in its 10K
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.160]   that it might be losing younger users.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:14.960]   Is Facebook over?
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.960]   You're young.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.080]   Yeah, you're young.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.360]   Is our kid.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.920]   Is our kid.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.600]   You mean do some tech support for you?
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.440]   Yeah, come on.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.440]   That's a good deal.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.600]   I can't figure out how to turn this off.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.840]   Is it got a switch?
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.920]   Is it over for Facebook?
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.960]   Well, Mark?
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   With kids.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.040]   We're waiting with the younger people.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:38.640]   No.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.120]   No?
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.640]   OK.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.000]   But social networks tend to be trendy.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.560]   Yeah, a tumbler is kind of-- tumbler
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.640]   is huge with the young people.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.400]   Yeah, but used for a very different thing.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.440]   Twitter is the same way.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.720]   I mean, all of these can coexist right now.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.320]   It's just-- you don't leave one for the other way.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.360]   There's no--
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.480]   Adam Rifkin for what?
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.040]   Says tumblers Facebook 2.0.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.640]   Really?
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.800]   Tumbler may already eclipse Facebook
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.560]   as the most popular social network among 13 to 25 goals.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.440]   I don't use either one, and I still don't use it.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.080]   That's because you're not 13 to 25.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:12.760]   This is true.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.160]   You haven't seen that in a few years.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.320]   Hell.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:15.880]   I could see--
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.840]   Yeah, if I'm reincarnated.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.880]   You use Facebook.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.720]   I use Facebook because I'm an old guy.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.880]   You use tumbler.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.680]   I do use tumbler.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.440]   OK.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.400]   Mark, you use tumbler?
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.320]   Minimally.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.080]   Minimally.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.720]   OK.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.880]   Someone in the chat room mentioned Snapchat,
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.320]   and I think that's--
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.040]   That chat's hot.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.000]   --accredible competitor to Facebook for time.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.520]   I mean, it's not going to become sort of the phone book.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.520]   In the picture.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.080]   That other one.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.000]   But didn't Facebook-- maybe Facebook felt the same way
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.600]   because Mark Zuckerberg stayed up late one night
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.400]   and wrote "Poke."
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.400]   And it hasn't--
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.720]   --rerope-poke, and it hasn't really--
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.400]   It hasn't done much.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.600]   He's done, yeah.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.160]   Stayed up late one night.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:51.480]   He did.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.120]   He wrote it.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.480]   You know, that was the funny thing, as he--
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:53.920]   He says anyway.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.000]   He can code.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:55.840]   He can code.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.360]   He's proven it.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:01.520]   Boy, this is a great week for tech news.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.480]   Boy, it's terrible.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.080]   You know why I'm going to tell you right now it happened.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:04.840]   Tell me what happened.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.600]   You changed the style of the show.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.440]   It's my fault.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.120]   Let me tell you what happened.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.920]   You took this show, and you flipped it
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.520]   by putting that Tom Merritt guy--
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.480]   Oh, and I screwed it all up.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.080]   --at the beginning.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.640]   You should have put it there.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.840]   It's like New Coke.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.880]   And all of a sudden, the whole universe--
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.680]   I blame the bobblehead.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.960]   And that didn't help.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.360]   That-- Chris Perillo thing.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:32.480]   And so you-- the universe is having a fit.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.200]   According to Timo News--
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   It's good to see there is any.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.960]   --T-Mobile may be unveiling its new contract-free system
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.360]   later this month, as early as March 4th--
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.160]   going to affect March 24th.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.240]   Timo-Bble's CEO has been talking for some time
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.120]   about eliminating long-term contracts,
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.320]   going month to month, unsubsidizing phones, I guess.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.680]   They rebranded themselves as the un-carrier.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.840]   They got a Jamaican guy.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:03.080]   And he said, Timo-Bble, it's the un-carrier man.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:03.720]   Unbelievable.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.720]   Unbelievable.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:09.360]   They're going to sell the iPhone.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.600]   You may love your iPhone, but you hate AT&T.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.640]   You're going to love T-Mobile.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.360]   Will this be enough to save the number 4 carrier?
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   Are they number 4?
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.360]   I think they are, right?
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.360]   Sprint's not.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.360]   I like T-Mobile.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   I like T-Mobile.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   They have a deal on T-Mobile that's 30 bucks a month.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.360]   It's fantastic.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   I mean, if your price performance, it's great.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:36.360]   And the quality of both the surfing and the voice is not bad.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.360]   You're using an XS4 on T-Mobile?
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.120]   Unlocked XS4 on T-Mobile?
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.360]   This is a Galaxy Google.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   Oh, it's a Galaxy Google.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   Land is unlocked, yes.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.360]   Still no LTE.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:53.800]   And the strategy in the US for not doing, not subsidizing phones, not doing contracts,
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.000]   is just not worked.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.360]   I mean, Leap Wireless got the iPhone.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.360]   Leap has started with the 5.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.360]   Wow.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   Unsubsidized, so you pay $500 or $600 to get it.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   And they're not selling it.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   Nobody's selling it.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:12.920]   People are surprisingly sensitive to the upfront cost, even though that's the month to month
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.920]   that kills you.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.360]   I mean, Google took a shot at that too with their Android store.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.360]   It's all direct.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.360]   And that flocked within six months, I think.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.360]   It's just not a model that works in the US.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.720]   And yet, in Asia and Europe, that's the standard.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:33.280]   I think American cell phone users have Stockholm syndrome.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.800]   We've come to love our hostage takers.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.080]   I was never taking hostage.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.960]   I've always used unlocked phones.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.480]   You used to use those cheap 711 Go phones.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.480]   The burners.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.480]   Right.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.480]   The ones you could throw away.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.480]   You can make your deal on the phone.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.480]   It's right in the can.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.480]   It goes.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.480]   Throw it away.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   I learned that on the wire.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.480]   You got to wipe it first because they do the whole fingerprints.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.480]   Right.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.480]   Wow.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.080]   This is really exciting.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.800]   What else?
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.320]   The Nook.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.520]   What's happening is Barnes and OK.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.600]   I was always a little worried about Barnes and Noble and the, you know, as a brick and
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:11.120]   mortar retailer in the face of Amazon, the Kindle is killer.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.080]   Barnes and Noble created the Nook.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:21.040]   Now they're saying year over year, 25% drop in e-book sales at Barnes and Noble.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.520]   Why don't they sell their e-books to work on the Kindle?
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.200]   They sell more books.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:31.120]   25.9% e-books and devices in the quarter end of January, 20th.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.120]   They're getting killed by Amazon.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.120]   That's the problem.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:40.040]   And the co-founder of Barnes and Noble, I read recently, was saying, you know, I'd be
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:43.680]   interested in buying back Barnes and Noble, but I don't want the Nook.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.640]   You guys can spin out that division and hang on to it.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.200]   Well, I'm Microsoft with $300 million into Nook.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   Yep.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.200]   That lost.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.680]   I don't remember that.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.280]   Why?
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.240]   That was one of the questions many asked at the time.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.720]   Now we're really wondering.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.560]   So there's been a call recently for Steve Ballmer's head.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.880]   And I think it's louder than I said.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:06.880]   You've been on, you're a Bloomberg.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.880]   You should notice this.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.440]   I think it's louder than before.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.240]   I think they're really getting, they're really going after him.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.640]   I don't get the sense that it's at a fever pitch right now and like you were alluding
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.720]   to, it's been happening for the last five years at least.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.880]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.560]   It just seems louder to me.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.960]   Windows 8 for sure and the surface will be pretty important.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:35.080]   If he makes it to next year, the Xbox 3, whatever the next Xbox is, we'll.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   These pictures of Ballmer shoot.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.640]   You should get a public relations person to get these things on.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.280]   He's been working on a music video correctly.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.280]   You should watch this.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.480]   This is something Ballmer is doing with Taylor Swift.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.480]   I think.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:53:03.960]   If the Microsoft thing doesn't work out.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   You can go something.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.960]   You can back up singer.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.680]   Horace is saying, why did I do this show?
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.920]   I should never have done this.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:16.080]   Horace, you have a show on the five by five network, don't you?
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.080]   This is a backup.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.080]   I got a backup.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.160]   We're going to take a break.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.440]   Please, John, I'm beg of you.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.160]   Find a story that will galvanize this audience galvanize this panel.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.160]   Get us talking.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   This is one of the problem is we have a dead audience.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.360]   They're dead because we're dead.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.440]   It's because I put the Tom Merritt commercial in the wrong spot.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.440]   I know it.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   You're right.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.240]   You know, I always thought he was in took today.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.920]   I swore that he was always alive.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.960]   I gave it away when he said, thanks Leo, even though I didn't throw it to him.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.960]   I think so.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.960]   And I never noticed this before.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.720]   I'm sure they brought you by Squarespace.com.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.760]   They've added something new.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.400]   So we had Mr. Dandy in here.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:54:00.680]   He's the guy who made this lovely Leo bobblehead doll.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.560]   And we were telling Mr. Dandy, he has a Squarespace site at mrdandy.com.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.520]   We said, you know what you got to do is you got to upgrade to the Squarespace e-commerce.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.320]   You could sell these things directly.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.320]   They have an e-commerce they go now.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.080]   So Squarespace, we've talked about it before.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.080]   They take credit cards.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.080]   They do.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.080]   It's the best.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.080]   Is a process?
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.080]   Yes.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.080]   They don't even take a cut of the processing.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.080]   What?
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.080]   Yes.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.880]   Well, that could be a great pal.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.880]   Are you interested now?
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   I'm going to get PayPal.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:30.400]   Well, you know, the no agenda show.com uses 24 bucks a month.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   Squarespace commerce e-commerce.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.400]   Squarespace.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.560]   They'll set you up with a merchant account.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.920]   They take no cut.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.920]   Just 24 bucks a month.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.140]   That's a really good deal.
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:42.680]   They're hosting plus the best content management software.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.040]   You could try it right now just to go to squarespace.com.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.040]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   Just use our offer code.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.680]   Actually, they won't even ask for an offer code.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.720]   They just set you up for two weeks.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.520]   If you decide to buy, take a look at what you get.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.080]   Squarespace's pricing has always been aggressive.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.280]   Again, remember, this is hosting plus their content management system.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.920]   Mobile responsive, beautiful designs.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.120]   The e-commerce is just one of the three packages.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.080]   You get the basic package, eight dollars a month when you buy an annual plan.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.980]   That's $10 a month to month, $16 for the unlimited plan.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.820]   Now add to the unlimited plan commerce and you get 24 bucks a month.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:20.500]   You get a fully integrated e-commerce solution for physical or digital goods.
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.500]   They give you coupons.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.700]   You want to do coupons codes, inventory tracking, tax.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.060]   They calculate the tax for every state.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.060]   Oh, that's good.
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.820]   Every region can be very important.
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:30.820]   Huge, right?
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:31.820]   Yeah, so waste time.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.740]   Amazon was pretending they couldn't figure out how to do it.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.140]   You still have to submit the money.
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.140]   What about that?
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.140]   Do the whole thing shipping?
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.620]   Do they submit the money to the states?
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:39.620]   I don't know.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:40.620]   You should ask them.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.620]   It doesn't say.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:42.880]   It doesn't sound like they would.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.360]   Well, maybe you could do that.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.360]   It's a lot of work.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.360]   Hide a check.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.360]   It's a crock.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.920]   The whole idea that I should be selling something in California to something in Louisiana.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:52.920]   Don't collect it.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.920]   Don't collect it.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   Don't collect it.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   That's your idea.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   Don't collect it.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.360]   Let the Governor Jindal come to your home.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.960]   Yeah, I probably would.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:08.860]   Squarespace offers this with no limits on the number of pages, galleries, blogs, no bandwidth
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:09.860]   limit.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:10.860]   You will never get a bandwidth bill.
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.500]   So if you suddenly go viral, no big deal.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.660]   Unlimited storage.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:17.900]   And you can never bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.740]   Really great system.
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.380]   And point with now with the e-commerce.
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.140]   What do you want to sell?
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.940]   Candles, dolls, digital goods?
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:27.940]   Voodoo dolls.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:28.940]   Voodoo dolls.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.340]   I'll tell you what.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:35.640]   You get Mr. Dandy to sell the Leo doll and you can sell the pins.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.480]   It could be like a one, two punch.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.640]   I'll give you some hairs.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.880]   Just, you know, because you need the full kit.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.360]   You get the doll, but then you have to space the hair onto it.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.360]   Is that right?
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.360]   Pick a pocket with a pin.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.360]   I don't know any of this.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.000]   Oh, you got to learn your voodoo.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.320]   That you do so well.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.680]   Squarespace.com does it so well.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.680]   Squarespace.com.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.720]   If you decide to buy though, would you do me a favor?
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.480]   Use our offer code TWIT3.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:02.100]   This is March now, the third month of the year case you didn't--
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.400]   Yeah, I heard that.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.540]   And you'll get to 10% off your first purchase.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:08.380]   That's why an annual purchase is probably the best idea you're going to save the most
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:09.380]   money.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:13.580]   The e-commerce truly is amazing.
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:17.940]   Really incredible what you get for a very-- I hate to say it, but you know all those
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.980]   other like Shopify and all of this guys are in trouble.
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.900]   This is so much better.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:23.900]   And just a--
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:24.900]   Probably right.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.900]   Just a correction on the ad.
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:29.400]   They use a merchant-- they set you up with a merchant service through Stripe.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.640]   And Stripe does--
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   Oh, Stripe does.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.640]   Yes.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.640]   Oh crap.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   Yes.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.640]   So it's--
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   Stripe takes a little cut.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.640]   But it's very competitive.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   It's very competitive.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.400]   Well, they-- but okay, so you're not-- but okay, but like--
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.400]   You have to stop the Stripe.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.200]   Visa and MasterCard would anyway.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:47.040]   So this is in lieu of or in addition to the credit card's fee.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.040]   I have a research that that must--
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   I haven't researched it that much.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.040]   That's just a credit card fee.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.040]   That's normal.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.760]   You'd always have to do that.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   I think.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.520]   Well anyway.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.520]   You know what?
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.520]   We'll find that out.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.520]   Why don't you start selling those mugs?
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.820]   You sent me a couple of mugs.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.820]   I want to thank you.
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.820]   The one that came in unbroken is--
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.260]   Did the restroom come broken?
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.260]   See, we're going to do it ourselves.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.260]   It's that little one.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.080]   Yeah, the little one with the T with the spoon and the--
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.080]   Broke.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.080]   Broke.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.080]   It's a million pieces.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.080]   The spoon weakens it.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.080]   I don't like that one anyway.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.580]   I didn't really care about that one with-- but the other mug is intact.
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.860]   And that's what I cared about.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.580]   So Einhorn has dropped its Apple lawsuit.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:28.380]   Again, I'm picking really great stories, folks.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.100]   Really great stories here.
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.980]   The shareholders are looking for more money back.
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.540]   They want cash.
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:34.540]   Apple's got it.
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.540]   The shareholders want it.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:40.660]   And they deserve it because the shareholders are really the owners of the company.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.660]   What could Apple possibly do with-- what are they at?
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:43.660]   $120 billion now?
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:44.660]   Something like that.
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.660]   Or more.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:46.660]   Insane.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:51.020]   It does seem that if they wanted the shareholders to buy into the idea that maybe they're going
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:55.260]   to do something with the money, they should spend some instead of just accumulating it.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.260]   Yeah, just hoarding.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.260]   Horse.
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.220]   Where should Apple spend its money?
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:02.620]   Well, I could give you a simple answer.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.140]   And I think that would be capacity in manufacturing.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.020]   But I think they're doing it already, but they can't spend enough.
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:14.740]   They're putting in about $10 to $12 billion a year in equipment to manufacture things.
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:19.340]   This is mostly fabrication equipment, fabs, as they say.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:25.220]   And either displays or maybe some of the semiconductor stuff they're doing with Taiwan.
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.660]   So you're not talking about cutting out Foxconn.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.740]   You're just manufacturing new types of--
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:30.740]   Oh, no.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:31.740]   Foxconn.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:35.220]   It's a misconception to think that Foxconn is a big part of the value chain.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:39.180]   Foxconn, the labor components, are generally quite low.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.980]   They're like $3 to $8 per phone.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:46.700]   The semiconductors are $100 to $200 a phone.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.300]   That's where the real costs are.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:55.700]   And so in order to really solve the problem of capacity and the problem of scale, they
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.860]   need to really double and triple production every year.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:06.700]   And so the problem is that right now a lot of that is held by Samsung for microprocessors,
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.700]   but they need to somehow find a second source.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.700]   And it takes years.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:16.100]   That's the other thing you have to appreciate, is that the orders that are going in now for
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.460]   production are probably going to be product shipping in two years from now.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.780]   Because you've got to build the plants.
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.060]   You've got to build the lines.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.380]   You've got to test everything.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:34.420]   And so whatever was shipping in the fall was probably designed for manufacturing in 2010.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.980]   It's about two years.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.300]   It's similar to Intel, right?
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.300]   The same issue for Intel.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.980]   They have to plan where you're at.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.980]   Absolutely.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:43.100]   Is Apple building fabs?
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:48.980]   So someone else owns the fabs, but Apple buys the equipment that goes into the fabs.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:52.620]   That's the most important and most expensive part of the fab.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:56.700]   But as far as the building and the labor force and the regulations and dealing with the governments
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:00.460]   and the permits, that's the partner's responsibility.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.980]   Again, we're talking about some of the components.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.980]   Samsung probably does not get funding from Apple for its equipment.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:14.060]   But I would imagine Sharp and others in Japan are getting it right now.
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.060]   In fact, that's I think already been declared.
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.860]   But we're dealing with numbers.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:26.260]   Just keep in mind that Apple spends more on CapEx for manufacturing than Taiwan's semiconductor.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.380]   And they're about a half of Samsung's level right now.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.740]   They spend more than Intel.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:35.820]   Actually, it was a real eye-opener for me when you did that analysis on SMCO.com of capital
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:36.820]   expenditures by Apple.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:40.260]   It's been about $8 billion a year, more than $8 billion.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.340]   Yeah, it's over 10.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:47.060]   And on the quarterly basis, they overtook Intel, but it may not be on the nearly basis.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:52.580]   And it's way above other software companies like Amazon or Google or Microsoft.
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:56.780]   Right, because they don't need fabs, they would be spending it on infrastructure.
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:57.940]   Apple has its own, right?
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:00.580]   This is the servers and the data centers.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:05.780]   But those, I would imagine Apple spends 10 to 20% of its CapEx in that area.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.540]   They do declare that they do make those investments.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:14.260]   But I want to point out one thing that I think maybe also is not being observed right now.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:18.740]   And it just came out actually in the news this week, is that increasingly they're now
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:25.460]   semiconductors, manufacturers being built into the connectors.
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:29.380]   So I don't know if you guys probably already heard about this.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.260]   This is the lightning adapter that comes that you can buy.
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.020]   It's got arm chip in it.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.020]   Right.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.620]   It's the same processor that the iPhone one had.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.580]   And this is the connector.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.620]   Yeah, there's a connector.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:44.460]   And not only that, but it's got two gigs of memory.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.460]   What?
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.460]   Three.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:53.380]   And it has, it boots in a kernel of Unix.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.940]   And of course, it's OS 10 Unix.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.860]   And it has the boot and it's upgradable.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:02.980]   So you can actually do a software update to the connector.
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.180]   And so the thing you have to, you know, so this is the old one.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.780]   The old one was a pass through.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:08.780]   There was no intelligence.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.460]   This is not for all arm connectors.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.100]   This is for their video connector.
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:14.100]   HDMI.
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.100]   The digital lightning aviator.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.100]   Right.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:22.340]   I understand that the reason is that it, you know, the lightning connector is serial and
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.380]   HDMI needs to be parallelized.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:29.700]   So they need to somehow create, create the signal from, from, from a certain encoding
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:30.700]   to another.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:36.700]   And the interesting thing to me is that you imagine the intelligence or the processing
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.140]   power you need to embed in all kinds of things.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:45.300]   Now they're moving processors, not just into phones, but now we're seeing processors entering
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.740]   into peripherals and into actual connectors between peripherals.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:55.620]   And each microprocessor has to be built by somebody and the memory has to be sourced.
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:00.580]   And this is just going to be at the point where we're not counting computers like we
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:09.020]   do in terms of units of laptops or PCs and, you know, like Gartner would.
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:14.820]   We're going to see intelligent processing going on in all kinds of things that we don't think
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.380]   of as computers.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.140]   And someone needs to build that stuff and the control points that you're going to end
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:23.260]   up with who has the capacity.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:28.380]   I'm giving a talk actually next week asking the question if the ecosystem wars will actually
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:37.220]   be one and fought on the factory floor rather than, than amongst the developer community.
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.300]   That's a very interesting question.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.660]   I don't know the answer to, but I think it's something we need to start exploring.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:48.020]   And there are some advantages to Apple to making these connectors so smart, of course,
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:53.700]   the means others can't make cheap knockoffs of them.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:58.180]   The guys at panic who discovered this arm chip in the connector speculated maybe that
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:02.580]   the connector could be airplay capable, which is a wild idea.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:07.500]   You wouldn't know exactly which way that maybe you would connect.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.500]   I don't know.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.940]   You wouldn't need a device.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:14.940]   Okay.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.940]   This is a computer.
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:16.940]   It's a connector.
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.740]   It's got a 256.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:19.740]   Okay.
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:20.900]   Meg's a ramp.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.300]   I would hook a keyboard to it.
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:27.340]   I remember going into a computer store and the guy was saying, you know, you're really
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.980]   need on your Windows PC is probably Windows 95.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.500]   Maybe Windows 3 one is you need eight Megs of RAM.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.100]   You got two Megs for the operating system.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.100]   Talk like this.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.100]   Two Megs for the app.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:44.220]   You got two Megs for your if your ram drive and then two Megs for your cash.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.580]   That's eight, eight Megs.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.300]   And I thought, Oh, no one's ever going to have eight Megs in a computer.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.300]   This you're in.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.300]   Yes, yes.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:51.300]   Yes.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.300]   Yes.
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.700]   This connector has 256 megabytes of RAM in the connector.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   Wow.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.500]   Oh, now you're impressed.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.980]   I think it's pretty bizarre.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.900]   You get the Raspberry Pi, right?
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:02.900]   That's a huge phenomenon.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:03.900]   That's the same thing.
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:07.260]   I mean, then that was done by a bunch of amateurs or hobbyists.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.740]   Does anybody here do you have a Raspberry Pi?
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.940]   We have Raspberry Pi here.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.180]   Yeah, somewhere.
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.180]   You have one?
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.180]   Do you have one horse?
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.180]   Horace, you got one.
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.180]   No, I don't.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.180]   I don't.
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:18.180]   What would he do with a Raspberry Pi?
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.180]   He throw it somebody's face.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:20.180]   Not that kind of pie.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.180]   No, there's the effect.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.340]   They just cracked a million Raspberry Pi sold.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.340]   They cracked them?
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.340]   That's well a number.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.540]   They went through the ceiling of the number.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.340]   Was this a bad verb?
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.500]   Who invested in this company?
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.500]   Nobody.
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.300]   It's Cambridge University.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:37.420]   This reminds me of the phenomenon.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.420]   This is a repeat.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.420]   This is a cycle.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.900]   Remember the Sinclair 100?
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:42.900]   Yes.
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.620]   It was very much inspired by that.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.780]   99 dollar computer that didn't do anything.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:48.780]   Wow.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:49.980]   Raspberry Pi does something.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:51.700]   You can run Raspberry Pi as a media center.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:54.620]   In fact, we did a know-how episode a couple of weeks ago putting an XP.
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.740]   There's an XPMC version for Raspberry Pi.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:01.660]   You put Pi MBCs, whatever it's called.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:02.660]   XPMPi.
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:03.900]   I don't know what you call it.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:08.500]   You put that on there and you've got a media center on a $35 Raspberry Pi.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.180]   And then what do I do with this media center?
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.180]   Put it on your TV.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.980]   Now it's your smart TV.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.940]   Can I get Netflix on it?
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:15.940]   Yes.
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:16.940]   Yes.
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:17.940]   Through the media center?
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:18.940]   Yes.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:19.940]   Through the Raspberry Pi?
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.940]   Yes.
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.940]   Huh.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:22.940]   So I don't need a boxy box.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:23.940]   It's just like a boxy box.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.860]   You see in the boxy box the same software.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.580]   It's not like a-- well, yeah, it's like a Roku.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.780]   So I don't need a Roku?
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.740]   No, you can replace the Roku with this.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.060]   There's people making Android sticks to do the same thing.
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.060]   They're very inexpensive.
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:37.140]   I'm going to meet with the Roku CEO and find what's going on.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:40.420]   Well, I have to think that the low end is kind of eating away at his business a little
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.420]   bit.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.060]   And then, of course, we just see that LG just bought part of WebOS.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.060]   Did you see that?
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.060]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.060]   For their smart TVs.
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.060]   I think that's kind of neat.
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.060]   WebOS?
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.020]   Well, they need an operating system.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.180]   Most of these TVs, to my knowledge, use Linux.
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.060]   I guess WebOS is WebOS based on Linux?
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.500]   See, this is what's got to happen.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:03.300]   Apple has got to bring out a TV just to save the mess that we're getting into with all
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.300]   this kind of crazy stuff.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:05.300]   No, this is all good.
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:06.300]   They got to standardize it.
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:10.380]   This is-- no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:14.740]   Web-based for a TV does not make a lot of sense to me.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:19.580]   I mean, it would need to-- the applications would need to run in a very high resolution
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:22.540]   to look good on an HDTV.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:25.620]   You mean WebOS is not capable of that?
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.420]   There's no native applications for WebOS.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:28.420]   I mean, it's all--
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:30.420]   Well, LG would have to write in JavaScript.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.500]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.500]   It's Web apps.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.500]   You're right.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:38.340]   Okay, someone in the chat room came up with, "Oh, no, it's better because it's open source."
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.980]   And I disagree.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:44.220]   I think open source only works when there's a model for it to copy.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:49.060]   That's why Mozilla Firefox works because they could copy IE and make it better.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:53.900]   Just going crazy on open source just out of the blue, roaming around aimlessly.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.260]   All you have to do is look on the net and all these crazy projects that are going nowhere,
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.980]   there's thousands of them because they're not targeting anything.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:05.820]   You need to target for this to work as far as I can tell.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:11.220]   iOS or Android, which is more private?
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:12.220]   What?
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.220]   What would you guess?
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:14.940]   Don't look at the headline.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:20.260]   I would say the Apple iOS leak more, the apps leak more than the Android.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.260]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.260]   That's what it says.
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.260]   That's what it says.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:29.020]   There's a study posted by App Authority which evaluates apps for companies.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:33.980]   Say that free iPhone and iPad apps from Apple's App Store poor was of greater privacy risk
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:38.420]   than free apps from Google Play.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:42.580]   Somebody in the chat room called me on my little commentary right there saying that
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:46.700]   Mozilla predated IE, which I don't know if that's absolutely true.
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.380]   I don't think it is, but it's beside the point because they were targeting the Netscape.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.980]   He's thinking Netscape.
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:55.340]   When Netscape predated Mozilla, Netscape was there.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.340]   He's thinking of...
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.100]   I don't know what he's thinking.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.100]   The point...
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.100]   He's thinking of...
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.100]   He's thinking of...
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.100]   He's thinking of...
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.100]   No, no, he said that...
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.100]   Mosaic predated.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.100]   Oh, maybe that's what he's thinking.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:10.540]   Well, but remember that Mark Andreessen when he was at NCSA wrote the first browser.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.540]   I don't know if it was open source.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.580]   That was a team that wrote the browser.
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.140]   Mosaic was open source, was it?
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.140]   No.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.140]   It was not.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.140]   It was closed.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.140]   Well, I think it was.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.140]   I don't know.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.140]   I don't remember anybody in the chat room.
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.140]   No, you're just making up.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.140]   You're just saying no one, yes.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.140]   I can't be wrong.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:29.420]   You're just saying whatever, you know, just making it up right as you...
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.420]   Yeah, I am actually.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:36.260]   It's a shame, but it's come to that.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.500]   Groupon CEO.
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.620]   Groupon CEO Andrew Mason fired.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:44.140]   So the guy who came up there, he got fired, but Leonsis, or...
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.780]   Ted Leonsis from Fennel AOL.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:47.780]   We all know Ted.
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.780]   Yeah.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.900]   He tells a smart guy, he might be able to fix it.
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:51.900]   Is he the new CEO?
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.900]   Co-CEO with...
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:54.900]   Yeah, that's how we...
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:55.900]   That's how we...
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.900]   It's always a problem when you got co-CEOs.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:58.900]   Did they answer them now?
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.900]   No, they're looking at...
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.900]   Usually, one of them gets poisoned.
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.900]   No, you're thinking of the...
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.900]   Why I get the Chris.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.500]   You used to give them metachies.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.780]   That's a different thing.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:13.260]   Is Groupon a failed model?
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.260]   It's not looking good right now.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.260]   I've never used Groupon.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.260]   I mean, I tried to...
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.700]   I signed up for it once, and they started...
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.860]   Because I was going to go to New York, and I decided, well, maybe there's something there
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:23.620]   I can pick, you know, something going on.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:26.460]   So I signed up, and I said, I'm going to be going to New York.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.460]   And for years later...
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.140]   Never for the rest of your life, you're going to get to say that.
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.900]   They keep sending me stuff about New York.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:31.900]   I don't live in New York.
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:35.620]   They're going to go bankrupt, and you can still get those emails.
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:36.620]   They get...
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:37.620]   Forever.
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:45.420]   But using my fantastic email system from ctyme.com, I just put it in a...
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.700]   Click the box, and it got black-hold.
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:51.940]   The real issue with Groupon is the cost of the Salesforce, right?
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:56.940]   You have to have local salespeople everywhere you are, and that gets very costly.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.340]   Does it not?
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:59.340]   And difficult to manage.
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.140]   Yeah, and there are also questions from the retailers about the model, about what...
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.140]   The retailers insist.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.580]   Yeah, whether it actually converts customers, which is the whole appeal.
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:12.180]   The appeal of doing a Groupon, or whether it just gets bargain seekers who come in for
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.700]   the one-off and never come back again.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.340]   So we're going to see a pivot, are we not?
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.340]   A pivot?
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.340]   A pivot for Groupon.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:22.940]   Well, they've already taken a step into selling goods.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.500]   Yeah, Groupon goods.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.580]   You know, being more like Amazon.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.740]   Like more like FAB and fancy, more than anything, right?
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:32.580]   This idea of curated e-goods.
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:41.580]   Andrew Mason's goodbye letter was pretty insane, if anybody's.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.220]   Yeah, let's hear it.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.220]   What did Mr. Mason...
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.420]   I'll pull out a quote here.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:46.420]   He blamed the analysts.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:48.580]   He blamed the analysts, I'm sure.
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:49.580]   Let's see.
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:53.740]   After four and a half intents and wonderful years, the CEO of Groupon, I've decided that
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.780]   I'd like to spend more time with my family.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:56.780]   No!
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.780]   Boo!
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.780]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:12:59.780]   Boo, nobody should ever say that.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.780]   Next line?
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:01.780]   Just kidding.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.780]   I was fired today.
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:03.780]   Good line.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.780]   I was pretty.
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.780]   That's good.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:09.220]   A little later on, I'm okay with having failed at this part of the journey.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:13.260]   If Groupon was battle toads, it would be like I made it all the way to the terra tubes
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.500]   without dying on my first ever playthrough.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.420]   That's a pretty awesome resignation or firing letter.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.500]   He's got tons of money.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.220]   He could say whatever he wants.
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.340]   He's got a big exit.
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:28.980]   Not a big severance, but he made plenty of money while he was there.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.260]   Some thought it was a scam.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:34.140]   Was it a real business?
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.780]   Well, it seems so.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.780]   I don't think I...
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:39.780]   I don't know.
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:41.300]   It went public.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.580]   It's got the scrutiny of the securities people.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.380]   That's when it all went downhill, wasn't it?
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.700]   Quarter after quarter of bad results.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:52.340]   Then it starts to fall apart.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:57.780]   Samsung will be showing its Galaxy S4 in a couple of weeks, March 14.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.780]   These guys crank them out.
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:13:59.780]   It's official.
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:02.300]   Come and meet the next Galaxy, says the invite.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.020]   That could be the end-go to Barcelona.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.060]   I should have gone to Barcelona.
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:07.060]   Everybody else doing this show.
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.380]   It's doing this show anywhere but here.
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:14.100]   I wish I were at the I-Hop down the road right now, actually.
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:18.700]   Barcelona is Mobile World Congress.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.340]   I thought there'd be more announcements there.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.980]   It wasn't crazy with announcements.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:27.060]   We did Samsung released an eight-inch tablet, the Note 8.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.380]   And that's going to be used as a phone too.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.380]   They have phone on it.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:30.380]   Hello.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.380]   Hello, mom.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.780]   It turns out nothing new for them in Europe anyway.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:36.140]   In the US, they have a put phone software on there.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:37.140]   But you know me.
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140]   I like that idea.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.140]   I like big phones.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.140]   Yeah, you do.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.860]   I cannot lie.
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.860]   Thank you for the gratuitous--
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:46.860]   There's a bunch of--
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:47.860]   Do you notice by the way?
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:48.860]   The million gags in it.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.060]   Half the audience has actually walked out now.
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.980]   It's knockout.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:54.980]   I think they all snuck out.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:57.500]   I saw a lot of them jump out a window there.
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.140]   And that window isn't open.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.460]   Yeah, well, he's laying there dead.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.260]   March 14th, 7 p.m. Eastern.
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:04.740]   Come and meet the next galaxy.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:05.940]   I'm sure it will be the S4.
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:06.940]   What else?
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:07.940]   Right.
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.180]   And there's been a lot of rumors about what the S4 will be.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:13.540]   Galaxy S3, huge success.
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:16.540]   30 million sales in five months.
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.380]   Geez.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:25.100]   You know, a real credible competitor to the iPhone.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:30.260]   And it's just one of a fairly broad line of products.
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.060]   What about the Note 5?
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.020]   My next phone is going to be the HTC One.
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.020]   I'm really looking at that right now.
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:37.660]   It looks beautiful.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.060]   You have a different phone every two months.
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.020]   I love that about my life.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.700]   What are you rocking right now?
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.180]   A Note 2.
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.220]   It's a big note.
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:45.820]   It's a big note.
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:47.060]   But I'm ready for--
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.660]   It's a huge plunker.
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.100]   You keep that in a satchel or like a fanny pack?
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.420]   Yeah, we're a fanny.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.180]   It's not that big.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.780]   It fits in your breast pocket.
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:55.780]   It's not that big.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:56.780]   I like it.
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:57.780]   Or a merch.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.340]   This will be the first time I've gone backwards.
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.740]   I usually go bigger and bigger.
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:02.740]   And going to the HTC One.
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:04.540]   It usually goes bigger than you go smaller.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:05.780]   Yeah, it goes in common.
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:06.780]   It goes.
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.540]   With my age, it gets smaller faster.
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:09.540]   Well.
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:12.580]   But the new one is 4.8 inches.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.780]   So that's the one I'm going to go with.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:15.780]   Huh.
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:19.900]   You got to love this.
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:28.620]   The judge in the UK who told Apple, you must apologize to Samsung for implying that they
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.620]   copied you.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.540]   They did copy him.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.540]   No, no.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:36.300]   But in the UK, Samsung won.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.300]   OK.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.300]   And still copied it.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:43.180]   The judge ordered Apple to publish a notice on its website saying the Galaxy tab did not
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:45.500]   copy the register design for the iPad.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.900]   He has now been hired by Samsung.
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:48.100]   It's a patent expert.
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:49.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:53.180]   I guess it's cheaper than hiring him as an expert witness time and time again.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:57.220]   I thought this only happened in the US.
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.820]   That's pretty bad.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:02.900]   Motorola also hired Guy Kawasaki as a consultant.
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:03.900]   I saw this.
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:05.100]   Guy hasn't had a job.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.100]   Guy hasn't had a job.
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.100]   He's got new gig ages.
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.300]   He's been writing lots of books, though.
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.780]   He's been big on ebooks.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.780]   He wrote a book called Ego about ebooks, how to make money in ebooks.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.300]   Didn't you write an e-book?
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.780]   How to use Google+,?
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:21.580]   He wrote a book on Google+, which was an e-book, and that opened his eyes to the idea of making
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.580]   money in ebooks.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.900]   So then he wrote an e-book about making money in ebooks.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:25.900]   Right.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.900]   Which is usually what happens.
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.380]   And the next book is about how he made money on ebooks.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.540]   It's when you see those ads for, like, send me a dollar and an envelope, and I'll tell
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.780]   you how to make money in business online.
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:38.260]   And what it is is now you get a bunch of people to send you a dollar and an envelope.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.620]   Yeah, and you say, that's how you do it.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:40.620]   That's how you do it.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:42.540]   The same way I just screwed you, you screw everybody else.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.540]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.540]   That's American way.
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:45.540]   What a great country.
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:46.540]   Yes, Horace, please.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:51.540]   You just said that he was hired by Motorola.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:56.180]   At what point do you decide when you're working in that company, whether you're working for
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:57.660]   Motorola or for Google?
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.900]   Well, that's a really good question.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.900]   Google doesn't seem to really want Motorola.
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.300]   John, you said it was the patents.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.300]   It wasn't the hand-set.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:05.660]   That's what my understanding is.
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.540]   They did try to sell, they've been trying to sell off the set-top box.
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:09.700]   I think they did set it sell off the--
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:10.700]   Maybe.
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:11.700]   --set-top box business.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:12.860]   Which makes no sense if you think about it.
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.860]   I thought that was a real opportunity for Google.
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:15.860]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.860]   To do a set-top box, apparently.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:21.660]   Well, the division specialized more in sort of cable boxes.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.100]   Like, did that still have any deals with the cable company?
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:27.420]   To me, that was the opportunity because all these cable companies have been buying these
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:31.140]   crappy Motorola, you know, set-top boxes.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.780]   Maybe Google could have said, hey, you know what?
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.180]   Maybe we could make this a little better with Google TV on here.
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.340]   You've already got a business with us, a deal with this.
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.260]   Had they tried to put Google TV on there, all of the cable companies would have cut
[01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:42.260]   the deals.
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.260]   They would have said no.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.260]   Too expensive, we don't want it.
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.140]   The TV so far has been--
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.140]   Oh, right.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:51.220]   --go around all of the media cable companies, the broadcasters.
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:54.980]   Guy is going to reinvigorate the Motorola brand.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.300]   Well, maybe he can.
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:58.300]   This would give him something to do.
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:01.620]   He's going to focus on product design, user interface, marketing, and social media.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:04.780]   He's going to do Mr. Moto.
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.780]   They had a Moto thing, remember?
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:06.780]   Oh, yeah, Moto.
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:07.780]   Hello, Moto.
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:08.780]   Hello, Moto.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.420]   That was a terrible campaign, but it was the worst.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.980]   The best campaigns for the head, the dog, and all these years.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.020]   The dog that buried the phone, remember that one?
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.020]   Remember she had an awful--
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.780]   And then they did this right thing, which scared you about your phone.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:20.780]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:22.780]   I don't want my phone to be a scary robot.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:23.780]   Right.
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:24.780]   I agree.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:25.780]   That was for Eisen's two.
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:26.780]   Actually, it's all--
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:27.780]   So that more of a right thing.
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:29.300]   It's also Kawasaki can write another book.
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:32.140]   By the way, Kawasaki's book is not ego, it's ape.
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:33.140]   I apologize.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.620]   I don't know why I thought it was ego.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.620]   It's ape.
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:37.620]   And I can't remember what that stands.
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:38.620]   One time I did a--
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:40.620]   I don't know why he thought it was ego.
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:42.820]   One time I did a speech with him.
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:46.500]   And he came up the stage after I was there, and I said to him, you know, we got something
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.500]   in common.
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:48.500]   He says, what?
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.580]   I said, conflict of interest.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:51.580]   Nothing.
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:52.580]   Why?
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:53.580]   He didn't get it.
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.580]   I was kind of fun.
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:56.820]   I suppose the C1's at a conference.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:57.820]   That's my only interaction.
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:58.820]   No, I love guys.
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:19:59.820]   He's a good friend.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.540]   And he's been on our shows many times.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.540]   I don't think he's fun.
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:05.460]   His book is called Author Publisher Entrepreneur.
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.460]   That's what apes do.
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:07.460]   Oh, ape.
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:08.460]   Oh.
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.460]   Well, OK, I get it.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.460]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:11.460]   And it's actually-- I've recommended it to people.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.460]   It's a good book.
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:14.260]   It's a gorilla on the front.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:18.740]   One of the things he says is your ebook has to have a good cover.
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:19.780]   It's an ebook.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.540]   Well, it seems counterintuitive, isn't it?
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:25.700]   Yeah, because normally good covers are designed, so when you're walking through the book stories
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:26.700]   go on--
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:27.700]   Wow!
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:28.700]   But think about what the book story is now.
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.700]   It's Amazon, right?
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:30.700]   Yeah, but--
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:35.700]   So one of his points in ape, which is 300 pages long, so it's not like a lightweight--
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:36.700]   Non-trivial.
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:37.700]   --trivial.
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:38.700]   --what's its most trivial.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:39.700]   It's a non-trivial.
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:40.700]   It's a font size.
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:41.700]   It might be big, I don't know.
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:48.980]   But what he says in ape is that even in an online bookstore, the cover makes a huge difference.
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:53.020]   And he actually did some testing and stuff, makes a huge difference in sell-through.
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:56.100]   You really do need to pay attention to that, even though you would-- you're right.
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.020]   It's counterintuitive, you'd think not.
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.020]   Well, he's probably right.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.020]   He's an expert.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:01.860]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:06.820]   Only another half hour left, thank God.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.420]   The show brought to you by--
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   Also, you got it.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.420]   Here's the other thing.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:11.420]   Yeah?
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:12.420]   Show one.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:13.420]   And it drained all your energy.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:14.420]   I think you had the show Drain My Energy.
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.420]   It did.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:16.420]   Yeah, this is a problem.
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:17.420]   You're working yourself to death.
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:18.580]   I'm working myself to death.
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:21.500]   Yeah, you're going to have to pull back.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:22.500]   Pull back.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.500]   Delegate.
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.700]   Or I just have this little guy do some of the show.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:29.300]   The show brought to you by GoToAssist.
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.300]   Are you an IT?
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.300]   No, you're not.
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.860]   But I'm talking to the audience at home.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:34.180]   Are you an IT?
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:38.500]   Do you have to support computers, maybe software?
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:42.460]   GoToAssist is a must have for the IT professional.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.100]   Visit GoToAssist.com.
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.540]   You can learn all about it.
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.260]   It's for Citrix.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.500]   So you know, of course, it's well designed.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.300]   You probably have used the Remote Access module.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:58.220]   In fact, for the last 10 years, GoToAssist Remote Access has been the number one choice
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:00.460]   for IT professionals for Remote Access.
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:01.540]   It's huge.
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:05.780]   But they've recently added new features that make this even more valuable.
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:12.340]   They've added a module called Remote Monitoring that lets you track everything in your customer's
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.340]   network.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:16.020]   This is how you're going to turn into a managed service provider.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:19.460]   Somebody can really deliver on support.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:23.380]   So you install the crawler on your client's network here.
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:24.380]   And it will go out.
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:27.340]   It'll find every bit of hardware and software.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:31.580]   And then you set up the dashboards to track performance, network performance, even things
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:36.820]   like how much hard drive space is left, toner, cartridge, everything.
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:40.500]   They have some pre-customized dashboards, but you can also build your own.
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:45.900]   And you can get alerts from instant messenger email text.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:48.180]   Very powerful stuff.
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:50.660]   Then you go in with Remote Access and fix it.
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:55.860]   And of course, you can track the problems with their new service desk module.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:56.860]   Easy to go.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.500]   Easily manage and track and resolve issues.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:02.820]   You've got change, release, and configuration management.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:08.140]   Your customers will use this too with a beautiful branded self-service portal.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:09.860]   It's very nice stuff.
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.060]   So let me get you to try this.
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:15.460]   If you visit gotoassist.com, click the try it free button and use our offer code TWIT
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:16.460]   TWIT.

[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:24.500]   All three-- do-- they're going to ask you which modules, little pro tip, click all three.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.820]   It's free.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.500]   And I think you'll find uses for all three.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.660]   So really, really go hand in hand.
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:33.860]   Go to assist.com, use a promo code TWIT.
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:37.740]   We love Citrix and we thank them for their support of go to assist.
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:41.100]   Our guest's horror studio of asymco.com.
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.620]   You just had your conference in San Francisco, right?
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:44.620]   It's over.
[01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:45.620]   Yeah, we did.
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.620]   Just January 30.
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:49.820]   Are you going to do another one soon?
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:50.980]   Yes.
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:53.020]   No later than six months, I think.
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:54.820]   And we're going to do it in London.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:57.020]   Oh, how nice.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:58.020]   Fun.
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:00.180]   So it went well.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:02.540]   Yeah, very well.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.140]   We were hosted by IBM.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.740]   It was in their Watson research center.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:08.740]   Sorry not Watson.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.340]   Almadin research center.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:15.340]   And it was great venue, great people.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:20.260]   We just talked a lot about the history of Silicon Valley, the history of California
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:31.700]   and the history of the Asian Tigers and whether the frontier of innovation is moving east
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:35.620]   or west, I should say, back east, if you will.
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:36.620]   Back east.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:37.620]   Okay, to the east.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:41.420]   Well, the far east, the far east.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:47.700]   So that's one of the themes we want to explore.
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.260]   Did Watson cook you any food?
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:51.260]   He's cooking it out.
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:52.260]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:53.260]   I love that.
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.060]   So this is the same computer that won the Jeopardy.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:25:00.620]   Yep, now he's crunching culinary data and coming up with meal recipes.
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:05.020]   That is, to me, that would be a challenging thing for a computer to do.
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.420]   If a computer could cook, could be a...
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.020]   So he's not obviously cooking.
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:12.260]   No, he's making recipes that others will cook.
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:13.260]   Yes.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.260]   New recipes.
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:23.380]   Well, so for IBM's investor meeting that just happened on Friday, Watson came up with
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:28.980]   Spanish almond crescents, Australian grilled asparagus and veal croquettes.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.420]   Wow, that sounds really good.
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.820]   Now these aren't others recipes.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:33.820]   These are Watson created.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:36.580]   Watson came up with this after crunching a lot of data.
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.780]   That seems to be a good AI challenge.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:39.780]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:42.100]   Chemical compounds and human preferences.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.740]   Can't work.
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:44.740]   What if...
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.620]   Because when you're creating recipes, you're tasting stuff and you're making combinations
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:51.020]   in your head in such a way that a computer can't possibly do because it's never tasted
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:52.020]   anything.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:56.420]   So the real problem with this, the computer doesn't care if it tastes good.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:26:01.740]   What if it could get data that said, okay, everybody said this tastes good?
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.540]   Yeah, like these ingredients taste good.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:08.860]   So for the Spanish almond crescents, Watson wanted something that combined saffron, pepper,
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.860]   honey and chocolate.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:10.860]   Oh.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:11.860]   Oh.
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:12.860]   No, that sounds good.
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.740]   That sounds elbouli good.
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.300]   No, it doesn't.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:18.300]   Sounds horrible.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.300]   That's what he does.
[01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:20.300]   No, it might.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.300]   He finds five completely disparate ingredients.
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.780]   That's what, yeah, but he's also working on trying to fool you.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.740]   You know, kind of trick you into liking.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.740]   Into liking.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:29.740]   He's ever said that his food is good.
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:32.540]   It's just interesting.
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.060]   Michelin gave him three stars.
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:35.460]   That sounds like he's good.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.260]   No, the food, the restaurant's fantastic.
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.500]   I mean, they have like three staff members for every guest.
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.660]   I mean, it's closed now.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:41.660]   Have you been that one?
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:43.260]   No, I missed out.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:47.460]   He got, he ended up closing the place because they were losing so much money that nobody
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:48.460]   could afford to keep it.
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:51.220]   Which is interesting because they were getting a million reservation requests a year for
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.060]   eight thousand slots.
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.020]   How could you lose money?
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:58.780]   He was losing money because he really couldn't charge what the food was worth.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.780]   That's the problem, right?
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:01.900]   Yeah, it's already costing it thousands of dollars.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:06.620]   You had to pay like to make money, you'd have to charge 10 grand a meal, you know,
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:07.620]   kind of thing.
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:08.260]   He should have, he should have.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:13.780]   Then he wouldn't maybe get a million reservation requests or build a bigger restaurant.
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:17.660]   I'm sad that I would have liked to have gone.
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:20.060]   I know two people have been.
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:21.060]   And?
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:24.660]   Let's say it's the most interesting dining experience they've ever had, but the food
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:26.060]   wasn't necessarily that good.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:28.580]   It was interesting.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.580]   Not good, but interest.
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:30.580]   It was in Madrid?
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:35.460]   No, it was in the Costa Brava in the southern part or the over by Barcelona.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.460]   So where did the Adriya go?
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.460]   I mean, is he kind of?
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:39.460]   He retired.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:40.460]   He retired.
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:41.460]   Oh, no way.
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:42.460]   He's doing, no, this is hilarious.
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:44.260]   I think he's working for Koker Pepsi.
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:45.100]   No, seriously.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:50.980]   What he should do is go to work for IBM.
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:56.460]   I really like this idea that a computer, I think this is why they're smart to do this.
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:58.340]   They've watched in first game.
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:02.660]   They beat the world chess champion with deep blue and then they say, okay, now that's
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:04.940]   two, that's all calculation.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:07.700]   So chess isn't a good challenge because it's calculation.
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:11.540]   So now they're trying to say, what is the difference in calculation and thinking?
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:14.100]   And they go to jeopardy, but it's still very fact based.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:17.820]   But that was a scam and a fraud, that jeopardy thing.
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:20.460]   So timing, I think it hit the button faster.
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:21.860]   And they got the questions in advance?
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:25.020]   Yeah, because they needed some time to crunch everything so they give it a little extra
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:26.020]   time.
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:27.020]   I hope they did a ridiculous.
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:28.020]   I hope they did a ridiculous.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.460]   But there's a thought about- You think Alex Trebek had anything to do with that?
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:37.100]   There's a thought that computers with humans, in other words, a computer and a human could
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.500]   beat deep blue if they worked in tandem.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.500]   Well, sure.
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.500]   A computer plus a human is better than a computer alone.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.500]   Right.
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.500]   And I'm thinking maybe with the recipe thing, it might be better if you had a real chef.
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.060]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:51.060]   Working with the computer and especially if they-
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:53.300]   Mr. El Bully should have gone there.
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:56.740]   He's working for Koker Pepsi now doing something crazy.
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:00.780]   I can snack food, I think, seriously.
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:03.460]   I'm like, we're at the Tui.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.300]   We're at the Tui.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:08.060]   Get back to Pixar.
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:12.700]   So the creative director, former creative director at Shaiya De Kensigal worked with
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.620]   the jobs 14 years.
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:17.140]   He was like his guy.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:19.060]   He put the eye in the iMac.
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:23.860]   That's like on his- I put the eye in iMac.
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:26.420]   So he had to.
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.740]   He's a guy who did the Think Different Campaign.
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:35.620]   So they asked him about Apple's ads currently.
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:39.420]   He said Apple's advertising history is as famous as its products, but something has changed.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:43.860]   Well, you can still argue that Macs and iDevices have a ton of appeal.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:47.460]   You can't argue that Apple is still untouchable when it comes to advertising.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:51.580]   The fact it is being touched often and effectively by-
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:52.580]   Now, other than Samsung.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:53.580]   And I agree.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:59.180]   I think the Samsung ads- I'm not sure about the unicorn riot.
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:01.740]   And they weren't playing that a little too much too.
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.740]   Yeah.
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.500]   Samsung Safe, the Enterprise, Samsung Enterprise.
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.500]   Well, that's what they're pushing.
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:07.500]   You can see this commercial.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:08.500]   The unicorn game.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.700]   I think it's a series of ads too.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:13.500]   It's on all- Long series of ads.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:18.460]   Also the Super Bowl ad was a little weird where they brought in a couple of actors.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:19.460]   That's right.
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:20.460]   It was a little strange.
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.340]   But I love the ads that people waiting in line.
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:24.300]   And then mom and dad show up.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:29.060]   I mean, you put those against the Siri ads with Zooey Deschanel.
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.900]   Oh, terrible.
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:31.900]   Martin Scorsese.
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.980]   Those aren't very good.
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.380]   No, not at all.
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:39.820]   Plus, and I think Seagal mentions this as well, it's clear Samsung's way outspending
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:40.820]   Apple.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:41.820]   You see those ads.
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:42.820]   In fact, that may be the one flaw.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:44.620]   You see those ads everywhere all the time.
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:45.620]   Yeah.
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:47.860]   And Samsung is spending internationally.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:50.860]   Where's Apple tends to focus on certain markets with his advertising?
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:52.860]   Samsung is definitely outspending.
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:58.140]   Because Apple is feeling a bit like Obama after his first debate with Romney.
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.740]   It deeply believes in his ideas.
[01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:01.700]   It just needs to express them more forcefully.
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.340]   This guy Norman Mailer?
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:04.340]   I don't know.
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:07.500]   He's probably trying to be, you know, he's retired.
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.780]   Oh, this film, Philip.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:10.780]   Yeah.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:15.540]   But, you know, I can't disagree with him.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:17.500]   And now Samsung talk about copying.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:21.140]   They're doing the new wall of the app looks just like Passbook.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:23.620]   It even has a similar icon.
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:24.620]   It seems odd.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:27.380]   This is the analysis at Mobile World Congress.
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:29.500]   It's called Samsung Wallet.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.860]   Which is the same name as the Windows Phone 8.
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:32.860]   And Google.
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:33.860]   Google calls there's wallet.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:34.860]   Right.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:38.980]   Actually, I guess wallet, you can't trademark wallet, maybe.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:41.420]   There's the two icons.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:44.700]   On the left, Apple's Passbook icon on the right, Samsung's wallet.
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:47.220]   Both of them have tickets and a pouch.
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.220]   Right?
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:49.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:54.940]   You know, these guys, I don't understand why they can't.
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:56.140]   Why can't we just get along?
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:58.020]   Be a little more creative.
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:00.580]   It does seem as if Samsung.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.860]   But is that Samsung or Android?
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:03.860]   That's Samsung.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:04.860]   Okay.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:05.860]   So they did this themselves.
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:07.860]   Four Samsung phones.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:11.620]   You know, that's the big thing now is to really make the distinction between generic
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.540]   Android, which you've got on your Google.
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.540]   Right.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:17.020]   And the great thing about this, by the way, says it says Google on the back.
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:19.340]   It always gets upgraded immediately.
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:20.620]   That's not true, by the way.
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.300]   I got 4.2.2 on here.
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.300]   Well, that's good.
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:25.300]   It's not a guaranteed.
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:26.300]   4.2.2.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:32.740]   It should be one of those ads.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:35.100]   I like what TweetBot did.
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:38.740]   TapBot, which makes the TweetBot app, which is a kind of expensive app on the Macintosh
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:39.740]   platform.
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:41.580]   I think it's 20 bucks.
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:44.980]   20 bucks, something like that.
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:50.860]   If you pirate it-- and this is an issue if you're a Twitter client because Twitter only
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:55.580]   gives you 100,000 tokens or twice what you have already got signed up.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:59.540]   So in TweetBot's case, they probably have far more than 100,000 tokens because they've
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.980]   been around for a while.
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:05.820]   So I don't know how they know if you're pirated, but apparently if you pirate it, then when
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:13.060]   you first sign up, they suggest as your first tweet, "I've been demoing a pirated copy of
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.660]   TweetBot and really like it.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.820]   So I'm going to buy a copy."
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:17.820]   The funny thing is--
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:18.820]   They make you tweet this?
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:19.820]   They don't make you tweet it.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.900]   They just-- you know how you get-- when you first get it-- it's your first tweet, they
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:24.900]   suggest it.
[01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:25.900]   You could cancel.
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.900]   But apparently--
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:27.900]   It's like hello world.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:32.420]   Yeah, but apparently people-- pirates are not the brightest, maybe, because if you do a search
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:38.580]   for "I've been demoing a pirated copy of TweetBot," you get a lot of tweets.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:41.140]   They just go, "Yeah, sure."
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:42.540]   They're all from Arabs.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.540]   Okay.
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:44.540]   Well, no.
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:45.540]   One of the things--
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:47.460]   There's a lot of Arabic, but it's not just Arabic.
[01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:51.340]   But this is one of the things you realize now with Twitter is absolutely global phenomenon.
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:54.380]   You see non-Western characters in China.
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:57.580]   There's China, there's Japan, there's some more Arabic.
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:01.700]   Remember the original days of Twitter when there was-- when you could click one of these
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:05.140]   little icons and it would give you all the feeds coming in, all the time.
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:06.140]   It's changed a lot.
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.140]   And it would be fly-in by.
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:08.140]   Global feed.
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:09.140]   Yes.
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.140]   Global feed.
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:11.140]   Just imagine.
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.140]   I think Aptonnet still has that.
[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:13.140]   Yeah, they can.
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:17.340]   And it's a limited number of tweets or whatever you call those apps.
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:21.340]   What do they have a name for what they call Aptonnet postings?
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:24.100]   It's not very memorable, obviously.
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:28.180]   "I've been demoing a pirated copy of TweetBot and I really like it."
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:30.380]   It's like all of these.
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:31.380]   Disgusting.
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:33.380]   I mean, this thing's jumped the show.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:34.380]   That is brilliant.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:35.380]   Jumped to shark.
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:40.420]   No, I just think that's a great way to-- just a great way to shame people who have been stealing
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:41.420]   your product.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:44.340]   Oh, I keep doing the wrong key, but opening a million--
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:46.060]   Just poke at it.
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:47.540]   El Bouli.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:48.540]   Poke, poke, poke.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:49.540]   There you go.
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:50.540]   Look at that.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:51.540]   Not doing anything.
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:54.660]   And every time you poke, the whole thing shakes.
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.620]   You don't find that annoying?
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:35:00.220]   That's why they have that kickstand on the surface because it won't shake.
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:01.220]   This is like shakes.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.300]   I'm shaking my lap, terrible.
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:04.980]   Look, it just crashed.
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:06.820]   No, it's just a went to a new page.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.820]   Internet Explorer 10 now available on Windows 7.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:09.820]   Aren't you excited?
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:11.420]   Quick, run and download that.
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:13.420]   I got to get it when I get home.
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:20.340]   Improved JavaScript performance and a focus on battery life for mobile PCs.
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.340]   I don't know why that--
[01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:24.540]   You should-- yeah, well, how much battery life does a browser--
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:25.540]   It's browser-like.
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.860]   --to browser-like shoe up.
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:31.820]   Is Twitter worth $10 billion?
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.820]   Nah.
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:33.820]   No.
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:34.820]   That's an easy one.
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:35.820]   Yeah, we're done.
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:36.820]   Just saying no.
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:37.820]   Not even close.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:39.780]   Who thinks Twitter's worth-- well, a black rock.
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.780]   Black rock?
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:41.780]   Black rock?
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:46.020]   Black rock group just put in a big investment giving them a private market.
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:47.020]   It's not public.
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:50.780]   Private market valuation of $9 billion, Wall Street Journal's Dennis Berman.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:53.660]   All right, those guys who are the mercenaries in Iraq.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.580]   Oh, black water.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:59.540]   I see, that's right.
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:01.380]   Rock beats water.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:05.580]   I guess if somebody's willing to give you--
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:08.980]   Yeah, right, actually, water should be rock.
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:09.980]   Yeah.
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:11.180]   But water's not in that game.
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:13.660]   You notice it's scissors, papers, and rocks.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:14.660]   No water.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:17.900]   You know, there's a professional league of that game.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:24.460]   I guess if you had really good-- if you were really good at sensing microchangers in facial
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.460]   expressions--
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:27.180]   He's a bluffer, you could probably see what's going on.
[01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:29.060]   You could probably be very good at that.
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:30.500]   I wonder if Watson could do that.
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.540]   Maybe Watson shouldn't-- get chess.
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:34.500]   Rock and paper scissors.
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:38.420]   Okay, onward.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:39.420]   Good job, John.
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:44.420]   But you went and ate an orange instead, was to find a big, exciting--
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:45.420]   So I go--
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.420]   How about you?
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.420]   I got one.
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:48.420]   Go ahead.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.420]   You were going to say something.
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.420]   No, I'm not going to say anything.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:52.420]   Did somebody tell you that I was wearing a blue plaid shirt?
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:53.420]   Is that why you're wearing a blue plaid shirt?
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.420]   This is not blue.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:56.380]   It's blue-ish.
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:00.420]   I actually have a blue shirt, almost like that one.
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:01.420]   Almost wore it.
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:02.420]   I thought you were bluish.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.220]   It just was something about you.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:08.580]   Marissa Meyer says, if you're working from home, screw you.
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:09.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:10.580]   You've got to come back to the office.
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.820]   I wrote a column about this.
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:12.820]   I would too.
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:13.820]   Is this bizarre?
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:14.820]   Yeah, Margaret watch.
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:15.820]   I think it was in PC, man.
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.180]   This is bizarre.
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:18.180]   What is the story here?
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.660]   I have a theory.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:28.500]   This was a rare act for Marissa of unmediated peak that normally I would think that she
[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:34.740]   would get frustrated, get angry, and then go, "But I'm a CEO and I'm going to handle this
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:35.740]   more appropriately."
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:37.580]   I think she got pissed off.
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:38.580]   About what?
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.900]   About people working from home and not doing anything.
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:43.100]   Oh, they got people in the office not doing anything.
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.740]   Why doesn't she deal with that?
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.340]   But I think she got some metrics.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:50.100]   Somebody said, "Hey, by the way, Marissa, we've got 50 free customer service to ruin
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.100]   it."
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:52.100]   Somebody's agent's working at home.
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.100]   Look at VPN data.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.900]   You see how often they're actually not doing any work.
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:38:00.420]   And she got pissed off and wrote a memo saying, "You can't work from home anymore."
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:04.260]   When everybody knows that working from home is a more productive way to work, it's been
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:06.980]   studied to death.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:11.780]   Just because these people aren't doing their job by working from home is not...
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:14.100]   Well, just fire people who are not doing a good job.
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:15.100]   Yeah, she's...
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.300]   It's a strange thing.
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:21.020]   I don't think it's a big deal in the sense that I think it's obviously a mistake and
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:22.900]   they're going to change their mind.
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:28.140]   But it shows an unusual crack in the facade, I think.
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:29.780]   I think she just got pissed.
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.500]   Will they be punching clocks now?
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:33.740]   Yeah, what's next?
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:36.340]   Yeah, they should have a big thing of time cards.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:38.820]   Ching, and put it in the lower rack.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:42.820]   And then the big scandal will be the guy who punches in your time card.
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:44.380]   Oh, I hate it when that happens.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:45.380]   No, that's what you want.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:47.340]   The guy comes in before you do it.
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:48.740]   He covers for you by punching in.
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:51.420]   You're punching you in and then off you go.
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:52.420]   You stay at home.
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:57.340]   What do they call that when you ride on somebody when they open the door with their card key
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:58.340]   and you ride it after them?
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:00.340]   Yeah, it's called "Writing an After-Tailgating."
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:02.140]   They must be a name for it.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:03.140]   It's probably.
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.140]   Drafting.
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:05.140]   Drafting.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:06.740]   It's the same as the Mario Kart dream.
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:07.740]   Well, it's kind of--
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:08.740]   Tailgating.
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:09.740]   It's called Tailgating.
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:10.820]   Yeah, that's what everyone says.
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:17.340]   One of the bits of irony from the story was that Merissa Mayer had built or had had built
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:19.020]   a nursery in her office.
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.180]   Yeah, she can work from the-- she doesn't have to work from home.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:22.420]   She's got a nursery in her office.
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:23.420]   And probably a nanny.
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:26.540]   And a couple of nannies working around the clock.
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:27.540]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.540]   Well, she's a billionaire.
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:29.540]   She's got multiple residences.
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:32.420]   She doesn't care that people really can't afford to live in Silicon Valley.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:33.420]   She's an elitist.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:36.780]   Some people-- there was some speculation that this would save money because those people
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:38.260]   would quit.
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:39.420]   Well, they probably will.
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:43.620]   Well, a lot of them apparently were hired with the idea that you don't have to come
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:44.620]   in.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:45.620]   They may be coders and--
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:47.900]   And now they're saying you've got to move to San Jose and hang out here?
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:49.900]   Yeah, no.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:50.900]   I figured they're going to quit.
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:51.900]   We won't have to pay unemployment.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:57.940]   Yeah, I mean, Sunnyvale is not the most ideal commute for somebody living in San Francisco
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:59.340]   or somebody living in the North Bay.
[01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:00.340]   It is.
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:01.340]   Olders.
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:05.780]   There are people all over the place, right?
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:12.740]   Time Warner Cable says, you know, this Google gig of it thing, nobody really wants that.
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:16.780]   We have determined there is no consumer demand for gig of it.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:18.260]   Yeah, idiots.
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:19.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:22.260]   We can do one--
[01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:23.260]   Hey, that makes it so.
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:24.900]   One may get big per second, is good enough.
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:26.780]   That makes it so.
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:31.420]   We're in the business as Time Warner of delivering what customers want and they--
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.580]   They don't want speed.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:35.420]   The last thing they want.
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:40.580]   All they're doing is they're defining their own customers as out and out idiots.
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:42.660]   Our customers don't want it because they're stupid.
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.660]   We're here.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:44.660]   What are you saying?
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:48.900]   This is Time Warner's chief cable-- a company called Cable's Chief Financial Officer, Irina
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:50.620]   Stévez.
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:54.580]   We're in the business of delivering what customers want and stay a little ahead of what they
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:56.620]   think we think they'll want.
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:00.300]   But we just don't see the need of delivering gigabit to consumers.
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.300]   I mean, it does depend on the price.
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:05.300]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:07.700]   At $1,000 a month, they're probably right.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:08.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:10.660]   But how much does Google gig of it?
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:12.820]   By the way, that's probably what they asked the question.
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:14.380]   That's how probably how they placed it.
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:15.380]   Yes, of course.
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:19.060]   Would you pay $10,000 a month for gigabit ethernet?
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:20.060]   No.
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:22.060]   Anyone says no, our customers don't want it.
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:23.060]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:24.060]   We asked them--
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:29.300]   We asked charges, or at least when the 100 megabit per second service came out, they were charging
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:31.180]   $105 a month for that service.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:33.140]   Who's going to pay that for home in it?
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.140]   Right.
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:37.340]   But Google gigabit, I think, is really like 35 bucks cheap, right?
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:40.940]   Does anybody in watching-- it's living-- $70 is Jeff.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:41.940]   70 bucks.
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:42.940]   Yeah, 70 bucks.
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:43.940]   For a gig now.
[01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:48.340]   So I ask you Time Warner customers, would you pay $70 a month for gigabit?
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:50.180]   By the way, it's not just gigabit down, it's gigabit up.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:53.060]   I'd take it and I would pay about $100 easy.
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:56.060]   But I'd pay a hundred bucks.
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:41:58.060]   - Somebody sitting on the chat room said they'd pay 300.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:01.060]   - Hey everybody in the chat room saying yes for 70 bucks.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:02.340]   Of course you want.
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:03.620]   - Yeah, Google, Google.
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:06.560]   - Google paid 70 now for 15, 15, three years.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:09.540]   - In Kansas City Google, you know, said you can't have this
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:10.700]   unless everybody in your neighborhood
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:13.420]   or so percentage, 80% of the people in your neighborhood
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:17.580]   sign up, and it was universally subscribed to.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:20.440]   Apparently people in Kansas City wanted it.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:21.520]   - Hey everybody wants it.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:22.920]   It's so fine, love.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.060]   - That's a good business model.
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:26.900]   Just make up what your customers want
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.700]   if you don't want to give it to us.
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:31.500]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more,
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.500]   and then we'll find out why Square was slapped
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:36.700]   with a cease and desist by the state of Illinois.
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:37.540]   - Square?
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:38.420]   - Square.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:39.940]   You know the charge card thing, Square?
[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:41.140]   - Yeah, that little thing.
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:43.420]   - State of Illinois didn't like it.
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:44.760]   Why, didn't get a piece of the action
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:45.820]   in the correct state of Illinois.
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:48.060]   - I'm guessing they would have something to do with that.
[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:51.980]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com, audio books.
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:54.840]   The best audio book distributor in the world,

[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.380]   What is going on here?
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:12.720]   This is good, I typed in audible.xom
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:15.000]   and Google said oh you mean audible.com.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.720]   That's exactly what I did.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:18.080]   - Didn't even spell audible right.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:20.480]   - I spelled the whole thing wrong in Google New.
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.120]   100,000 plus titles, an amazing deal.
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:28.640]   And what great books, I am such a fan of audible.com.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:30.400]   Let me log into my audible.com.
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.000]   I noticed a lot of the books they recommend
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.760]   on the front page are books that we've recommended
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.920]   like Life of Pi, which was one of my favorite audio books.
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:40.700]   In fact, I don't wanna see the movie.
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:42.880]   I was such an experience.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.020]   I loved it so much.
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:46.200]   They've redesigned by the way the audible page.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.320]   So if you're an audible customer
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:48.480]   and you haven't been to the new webpage,
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.320]   I think you're gonna like it.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.280]   It's cleaner.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:53.080]   See how I can see two credits available in big letters.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:56.720]   What a great salt sugar fat
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.520]   how the food giants hooked us by Michael Moss.
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:00.600]   I gotta read that.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:03.160]   The Vatican diaries, ooh,
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.680]   a look behind the scenes at the power personalities
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:08.000]   of politics of the heart of the Catholic church.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.200]   That'd be good.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.360]   Right now it's timely.
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.320]   What are you looking at?
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.240]   - You're not a Catholic.
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:15.560]   - No, but I think it's fascinating.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:18.400]   It's medieval.
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.800]   The middle, I can't get enough.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.240]   - I'll get that one and listen to it.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.920]   - Would you do that for me?
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:24.760]   How about this one?
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.600]   It's just right for you.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.720]   Strong, hot winds.
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.560]   - Wow.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.640]   (laughing)
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:30.920]   I wish Joe Hanson.
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:31.760]   - Really?
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.600]   - It's almost as if he had a cheap shot.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.840]   I wish beneath you.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.800]   - It is, but I couldn't resist.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.560]   When I saw the book, I said that's John's book.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:41.400]   Well, here's the thing.
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:42.480]   You're gonna choose two books.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.920]   So you could make that one of your books.
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:45.760]   And then the...
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:46.600]   - Mm.
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.040]   - Strong, hot winds.
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:51.560]   It's probably a romance novel.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.280]   Let me just read the description.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.360]   Four years ago after Corey Brandale's passionate affair
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:59.080]   with Sheik de Monet El Karim ended,
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.960]   she gave birth to his son and kept it a secret from the Sheik.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:03.800]   - Huh.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:04.880]   - When Daemon finds out the truth,
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:07.000]   he kidnaps the boy and takes him across the world
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.320]   to his desert kingdom,
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.880]   knowing that Corey will follow.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.920]   This sounds good.
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:14.000]   - Yeah, we will.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.080]   - Totally.
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.320]   Until now, Corey never understood Daemon's loneliness,
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.600]   but is she strong enough to give him the enduring love he needs?
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:27.200]   Or, carnal innocence.
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.440]   By Nora Roberts.
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.720]   - Oh yeah, Nora Roberts.
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:33.560]   - I like Nora Roberts.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.800]   - She's a money maker.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:35.640]   - She's a money maker.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.000]   - I don't care much for her.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:37.840]   - Yeah.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.520]   - Well, the Hunger Games.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.360]   - What about him?
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.360]   - Good book.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:42.280]   - Really, you think so?
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.640]   - I haven't read it.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.480]   But it's on my list.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:45.320]   I actually downloaded it.
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.560]   I just haven't listened to it yet.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.600]   What I'm listening to now,
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:50.040]   you all know, 'cause I've talked about it,
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:52.240]   'cause it's a really, really long book
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:54.160]   is Patrick Rothfuss's name of the,
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:55.640]   well, I first listened to the name of the wind now
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.600]   listening to Book Two of the King Girl of Chronicles.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.640]   Did you finish that yet, Chad?
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.480]   - Haven't finished.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.320]   - It's long.
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.720]   - Yeah, I'm on, I'm like, I'm chapter like 27.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:03.960]   - I know, there's a lot of chapters.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:04.960]   I'm like 41.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:06.760]   - Yeah, I'm not even like a four through.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:07.600]   - I know.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.160]   - But that's my favorite type of book.
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.400]   - You just get lost in it.
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.680]   - You do.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:12.480]   Or how about this?
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.920]   - It's a duct tape parenting.
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:16.640]   A less is more approach to raising respectful,
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.480]   responsible and resilient kids.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.240]   God, I hope it doesn't involve duct tape.
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.120]   - Yeah, no, it totally involves duct tape.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.200]   I have no about this book.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:25.520]   The most about how to tie the kids down.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.360]   - No.
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:27.200]   - Yeah.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:28.200]   And then you put them in a chair
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.480]   and then you put the chair in a closet.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.600]   I don't recommend this book for anybody.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.240]   - No, I don't think it's a good idea.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.800]   Actually, I don't think that's what it's about.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.680]   Anyway, we could be wrong.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:38.520]   Here's the deal.
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:39.400]   You want to get a couple of books for free,

[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.680]   First two books are free.

[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.840]   And the new Audible Apps,
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.560]   I have the Audible App now on Windows 8.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.720]   It's really great.
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:59.440]   Windows Phone, iPhone, Android Phone.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:00.840]   They've just updated the apps
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.640]   to a clean, slick look to match the webpage.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:04.600]   They're doing nice stuff.
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:07.840]   Audible.com/twit2, your first book is free.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:10.000]   - They're looking like Windows 8.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.800]   - Yeah, it has kind of a, well, it's just clean.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.280]   It is a little Windows 8, isn't it?
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:16.760]   - Yeah, totally. - It's clean.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.400]   So these are my next three books.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:21.320]   I've already got them in the cart.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:23.280]   Jerry Pornell's The Gripping Hand.
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:27.600]   That's also a child rearing a book, I believe.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.520]   - I thought it was about something else.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.360]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.040]   Maybe it's not how not to have children.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:32.880]   That's probably what it is.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:33.960]   - Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:37.320]   - Audible.com/twit2.
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.280]   All right, we're gonna wrap this up.
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:40.120]   A couple of quick stories.
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:43.560]   Have I done, I've done Tom's The Week Ahead.
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.600]   I've done them promo.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:45.600]   That's really, really good.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.400]   - Maybe you do Tom again, it will reset the show.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.240]   - Maybe I could reset it.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.160]   - We should start over.
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:52.240]   - Yeah, you wouldn't mind if I started the whole thing
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.880]   would you, over again.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.160]   Square has been slapped with a cease and desist order
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:00.040]   by the Illinois State Department of Financial Regulation,
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:04.320]   the Transmitters of Money Act.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:07.080]   No person may engage in this state in the business
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.040]   of selling or issuing payment instruments,
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.960]   transmitting money or exchanging
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:14.040]   for compensation, payment instruments, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.120]   without first obtaining a license.
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:17.600]   - What does that got to do with Bitcoin?
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:18.640]   - Under this act.
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:21.760]   Should we, somebody sent me a Twitter
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:24.280]   that said we should accept Bitcoin as a...
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.120]   - Payment.
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:28.080]   - We have the same harassing people doing that to our show.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.360]   - The Bitcoin is now at the highest value it's been ever.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:32.360]   - Yeah, it's $33 or so.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:33.200]   - Yeah.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.880]   - But you can't really do that.
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.240]   - Well, you can buy pizzas with Bitcoin.
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:38.480]   There's a website. - Where are websites?
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.920]   - Yeah, there's a pizza in Wisconsin.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.240]   - No, I think it's Domino's.
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:42.480]   - Oh, great.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.560]   - No, it's a portal. - It's a portal.
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:47.240]   - You won't get the pizza. - It's a portal to...
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.080]   - Right. - It's a portal to pizza.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.000]   - It's a pizza portal. - It's a pizza portal.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.280]   - What would... So, pizza...
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:56.560]   - So, U.S. takes Bitcoin subscriptions.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.520]   - Really? - You can pay for subscriptions.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.000]   - Subscription to what? - To Wordpress.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.120]   - What do you mean, "at which subscription to Wordpress?"
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.040]   - Hosted for more space and...
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.160]   - Sometimes Wordpress takes money.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.200]   - Here. - Pizzaforcoins.com.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:11.360]   - You wanna say hi to Mimi?
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.520]   - Hi, Mimi. How are you? - I didn't turn her on yet.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.800]   - Here.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.360]   - Hi, Mimi. It's Leo. John said he just turned you on.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:20.200]   That's John White.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.960]   - Yeah. - I don't know why she's calling me well.
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.680]   - Mimi, John's on the air right now.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:24.960]   Don't bother us.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:30.520]   - Now she's apologizing. - She's saying up.
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:32.120]   - She just hung up. - I don't know.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.800]   - I love Mimi. Your wife is an awesome person
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.800]   and she doesn't get enough credit.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:36.640]   - Okay.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:40.200]   - A new website devoted to your hunger needs,
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.800]   but only if you're in the mood to pizza.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.040]   Going back to the infamous 10,000 Bitcoin
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.600]   for pizza back in 2010,
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:48.600]   a system for ordering pizzas with your Bitcoin.
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.320]   You choose your pizza company.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:51.760]   You can get Papa John's.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.960]   - I bet he likes that. - Pizza Hut or Domino's.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.080]   Mm?
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:01.200]   I don't have any Bitcoin or I try it.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:03.920]   This is not a quality product.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:06.920]   (both laugh)
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.800]   - He's, Chad, are we missing the boat?
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:10.680]   Should we be accepting Bitcoin?
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:12.440]   - Well, I was thinking about it the other day
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:14.520]   and like, I don't know what I do with it.
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:17.800]   - Well, I mean, you have to use it just like your credit card
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:19.400]   because you have a credit card number
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.120]   and that could be associated like a bit short.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:24.200]   - By the way, it's the use of your credit number.
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:28.560]   - But yeah, unless if everyone takes it, then it,
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:31.520]   so it's almost like the social network problem
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.520]   where everyone has to be on it.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.360]   Otherwise, it's not useful, but it's not useful
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:38.360]   until everyone's on it.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.360]   It's just a maritime before the state of Illinois
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.320]   sues the pants out.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:43.360]   - You guys have the right audience for it though.
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.960]   - Oh no, there, I'm sure there's Bitcoin runners out there.
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:46.360]   - Okay, as they're saying, how many people
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.240]   in the audience use Bitcoin?
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.600]   - Hey, there's a guy.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.760]   - Where are you from, sir? - Take one of the discs.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:53.200]   - He's from San Francisco.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.280]   Notorious. - Notorious.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.760]   - How many Bitcoins do you currently own hangout?
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:00.400]   - He must have a lot. - Oh, he's got a big Bitcoin.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.560]   - He's got a stash of Bitcoins.
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:02.480]   - Did they solve them?
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.360]   Because there was a problem with people stealing Bitcoins.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:06.200]   They've solved that issue, right?
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:09.360]   He says you can easily steal the coins.
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:10.560]   - No, that's no good.
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.800]   (laughing)
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:14.320]   - I'm in the bottom.
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:15.640]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:17.720]   - Not right.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:21.360]   - Horace, what are you writing about for your next blog post
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:22.680]   on Asimco.com?
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.000]   What's hot for you right now?
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.080]   - I'm looking at the iTunes economy.
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:32.480]   I think the fact that Apple switched
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:37.480]   their reporting about what used to be called a music business.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.800]   It's now called iTunes and they folded in
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:44.520]   the Apple Software division.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.960]   Because that Apple Software now is sold through
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.800]   the iTunes Store anyway, or the Mac App Store.
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.440]   - For the longest time, Apple said, oh, this is a lost leader.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:53.800]   We don't make any money on this.
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:56.440]   It's just a way to add value to the Apple platform.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:58.360]   They've gone beyond that, haven't they?
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:01.600]   - Well, my reckoning, I mean, they reported
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.640]   about $13 billion in revenue.
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:08.080]   So some of that is not, I mean, some of their gross income
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:11.600]   is not reported because it's actually on the agency model.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.720]   But I think that there are upwards of $15 billion a year now
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:19.560]   in terms of transaction value going through the iTunes Store.
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:22.840]   And that is a significant number that we should be
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.720]   looking at more closely and understanding
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:29.960]   where the costs are because if indeed they're collecting
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:32.760]   30% of all the transactional value,
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:36.600]   and if they're breaking even on that,
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:40.480]   you're looking at a cost structure in five to seven billion
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.400]   dollars.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:45.600]   So that is significant amount of money that is going
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.760]   up to something internal to Apple.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.120]   I think they are making money.
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:53.280]   So I don't think it's all going into the server farms,
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:58.160]   but it's still a question from a competitive point of view.
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:03.160]   Is this something that an alternative, you know,
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:09.960]   entrant or contender for being an ecosystem provider?
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:14.800]   Are they looking at the same investment level needed?
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.640]   Billions of dollars needed.
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:19.200]   - It'd be reasonable for Apple to hide that information
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:21.240]   because that's the kind of thing.
[01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:23.760]   - Indeed, it's a lot of money that's in there.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:25.160]   And if it's cheap to do.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:27.320]   - Yeah.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.800]   Yeah, it's like Google's own, you know,
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:32.160]   Google doesn't report a lot of its costs either.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:34.800]   So we don't really know what it costs to run Google.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:39.600]   But it is interesting to think about also, you know,
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:42.400]   because we're down to probably three major players,
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:45.920]   Google, Amazon and Apple, we're in the content business today
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:47.600]   or content distribution.
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:50.040]   - Well, that's going to do to the future
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:53.520]   of not just apps and music,
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:56.160]   but, you know, increasingly the TV space
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:58.200]   is going to be folded into this.
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.920]   So there's a lot of interesting thing also
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.760]   is Eddy Cugh that runs this business.
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:06.480]   I mean, he has to deal with five different industries.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:09.240]   He has to deal with people coming from book publishing
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:13.600]   to music publishing, music, I should say music labels,
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:17.400]   app developers, and they all have different expectations,
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:19.440]   different ways of looking at the world
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:21.120]   and what their value add is.
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:25.600]   And so somehow it all has to be re-purped,
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.600]   sort of resold through this channel that is iTunes.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:35.200]   So I'm very interested in looking at the economics of it,
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:40.280]   the competitive structure,
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:42.080]   how easy is it to enter into this,
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.680]   how easy is it to compete.
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:47.800]   And the data is beginning to come together.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:48.960]   That's the interesting thing.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.720]   If you can start to back out the crucial figures
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:56.000]   that will give us some answers, hopefully.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.760]   So I'll be writing more about that.
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:58.600]   - Interesting.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.320]   Use your best guess that it's somewhat profitable,
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:04.600]   wildly profitable, certainly not a break-even business anymore.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:07.200]   - No, but I think that they're mostly going to be profitable
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:09.400]   from their own software.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:12.080]   So we have, my expectation is they're running it
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:14.880]   about 17% operating margin.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.680]   So 15% to 17% on 17 billion is a lot of money.
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:22.200]   I think they're going to go over 20, actually, in 2013.
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:27.200]   So yeah, it's profitable, but not on them as a margin.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.840]   We're not looking at anything near the hardware businesses
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.600]   they have, but it is certainly above zero.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:37.600]   And also the whole business is growing at a solid 30%.
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:41.320]   And that is something you can try to extrapolate
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:44.200]   and it starts to look really, really interesting.
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.080]   - If you wanted to take over from Apple, though,
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.960]   they've been so successful at building this closed ecosystem,
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:58.080]   it's more than just the issue of can we make money at it?
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.520]   It's how do we get in there?
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:02.440]   How do we get a wedge a foot in the door?
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.240]   - Well, I think first of all,
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:06.120]   this is selling other people's content.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.200]   So it's not about open or not.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:11.760]   I think Google and Amazon are doing similar things
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:16.760]   in terms of offering a palette or a portfolio
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.360]   of media types.
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.360]   I think the interesting thing is whether the app model,
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:28.040]   which is actually one of the biggest chunks,
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:31.960]   it's about 15 billion downloads per in 2012,
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.280]   whether that app business is going to go more web-based.
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:37.800]   I mean, that's the big question,
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:41.200]   but right now developers are still finding it lucrative
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:46.200]   to do native code, which means the closed model, if you will.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:51.040]   And certainly Google is right in there.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:53.280]   Amazon is as well.
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.120]   Maybe Samsung will get into this game.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.600]   I think from a competitive point of view,
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:58.640]   that's really the question.
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:01.360]   If you're as big as Samsung is now,
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.760]   think about the fact that they make more profits
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:08.760]   from Galaxy than Google does for all of its business today.
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:14.120]   Samsung is a bigger player than Google, period.
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:16.680]   And so the question is for Samsung,
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:18.880]   what's next because they've said,
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:21.240]   hardware commoditizes, they know that.
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.640]   They've done it to others.
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:23.480]   - That's intriguing.
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:27.680]   - So how the Chinese are coming in the Huawei and NZTE
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:31.360]   are both gunning for that same spot that Samsung has today.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:33.520]   So they have to become an ecosystem player.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:35.640]   And it's not just about forking Android.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.080]   They have to track developers.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:39.080]   They have to track media companies.
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:42.360]   And they would have to be looking at these numbers about,
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:45.040]   what does it take, where do you make the investments,
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.480]   the lead times involved.
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:50.320]   I mean, iTunes has been around since 2004.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.640]   - Well, and many have taken a run at it.
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:54.760]   You look at Sony, which has taken many runs at iTunes
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:55.680]   and never succeeded.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.680]   And they even own a record company.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.520]   - Exactly.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:00.720]   I mean, here you would have thought Sony
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:04.200]   with all of its consumer electronics legacy
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:07.360]   could make a dent in there, but they weren't able to.
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:11.080]   So, and Sony, by the way, was also disrupted by Samsung.
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:12.760]   - It's on a TV business. - That's right, yep.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:16.200]   - So it's really an open question, I think.
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.160]   I'm not sure, again, what the answer might be,
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:21.280]   but I think that the first step is to understand
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:22.120]   what's going on.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:25.160]   And there isn't enough scrutiny right now
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:27.080]   of the iTunes business as a business.
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.160]   I think it's still seen as, you know,
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:32.040]   like you said, a break-even thing that sustains
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:35.920]   the hardware business.
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:38.760]   And Amazon is seen as sort of being actually
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:42.440]   very clever and innovative in terms of giving its hardware away
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:45.800]   so that it can make no margin on content sales.
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:48.400]   So, I'm not sure what the wisdom of that is,
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.600]   but the point is that Apple is doing that to some degree here
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:53.440]   with its TV business.
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:55.840]   It's giving away the Apple TV.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:59.320]   Essentially, it's not a high margin product
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:03.880]   while it's actually trying to generate content sales as well.
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:07.120]   So there's sort of like, I think of Apple TV
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:09.840]   as sort of Apple's Kindle.
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:12.640]   - Yeah, I think it's such disinformation when they say
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:13.800]   it's our hobby.
[01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:15.560]   (laughs)
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:16.960]   Whatever Apple says something like that,
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:18.280]   don't look over here, no, this is,
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:20.640]   there's no profit in the iTunes.
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:22.960]   The Apple TV is just a hobby.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:24.600]   That's the first place you should look.
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:26.640]   That's a big red flag.
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:28.840]   - Tim Cook has started to change the messaging on that
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:32.480]   a little bit saying, we're gonna keep pulling the strings.
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:34.120]   We think that there's something here,
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:37.240]   but I mean, you've just looked at their performance
[01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.080]   with the Apple TV.
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:40.080]   They obviously haven't cracked it yet.
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:43.880]   I mean, they're selling well by many standards within,
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:46.160]   I mean, it's the leader in that tiny,
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:48.160]   over the top set top box market.
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:50.200]   - I think they're sandbag in the Apple TV.
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:51.440]   - I don't think so.
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:53.040]   - I think they are, 'cause I think they've held back
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:54.600]   on the one thing that we really would put it over the top,
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:57.600]   which is apps, and they're holding onto that.
[01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:59.600]   I feel like they're keeping it off.
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:00.440]   - So what are they doing?
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.840]   They're ready to pull the trigger?
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:03.840]   - No, they're gonna pull the trigger,
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:07.640]   but I think, I just have a feeling they've got a long term.
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:11.000]   - Yeah, the trigger is going to be cancel it.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.240]   By the way, just as a side note.
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:14.600]   - Yes, you like my watch.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:15.800]   - You have a watch here.
[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:16.640]   - Yes.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:18.560]   - That's a $10,000 watch.
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:19.520]   - No, it's not.
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.360]   All right.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:21.760]   - It's a little less than that.
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:23.040]   It's a nice watch though, isn't it?
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:23.880]   You know what I found out?
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:24.720]   - It's a little bit clunky.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:26.080]   - Yeah, it's really big, and I bought it 'cause it was big,
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:29.280]   'cause I thought my watch should be equal size.
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:30.200]   - And what else?
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:36.480]   - And then, I found out that the inside of this
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:41.480]   is commoditized, that the works are based on
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:44.280]   what is effectively like a CPU
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:46.720]   that has sold to many watch manufacturers.
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:47.560]   Isn't that interesting?
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:48.400]   - No.
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:49.720]   - Okay, thank you.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.040]   We gotta thank everybody for being here,
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:52.960]   especially you, Horace, Teddy, you put up with us
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:54.160]   for a long, long time.
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:55.360]   Where are you located?
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:58.920]   - Well, I have a home in Finland.
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:01.200]   I'm actually right now in Boston, however.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:02.040]   - Oh, good.
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:02.880]   All right, I was worried you were in Finland
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:04.720]   and I thought, oh my God, it's like four in the morning.
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:05.840]   - You keep an eye up all night.
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:08.120]   - Northern lights are going and you're missing 'em,
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:09.640]   but no, Boston, nothing.
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:10.480]   - Nothing's going on.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.320]   - Nothing's going on.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:12.160]   - Nothing's going on.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:13.280]   Thank you very much, Horace, really appreciate it.
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:14.120]   - My pleasure.
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:18.840]   - We're at ASYMCO.com, certainly the place you should go.
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:22.200]   And we also encourage people to listen to your podcast
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:24.520]   about five by five, which is called?

[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:28.200]   - The Critical Path and really is fascinating.
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:30.760]   Really good stuff, both the writing out on Insempco
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:32.440]   and the show are great.
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:35.120]   Fivebyfive.tv, the Critical Path.
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:36.440]   Thank you very much, Mark Millian,
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.080]   for joining us from Bloomberg Business Week.
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:39.960]   What are you working on this week?
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:41.880]   - Well, I just got back from vacation,
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:42.960]   so we don't have a whole lot going on.
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:43.800]   - You're all right, I do.
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:44.640]   Relax.
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:48.160]   - I'm catching up on the last week, Hawaii, to Kauai.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:49.000]   - Nice, very nice.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:49.840]   - It was awesome.
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:50.680]   - Yeah.
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:52.200]   - I'm just gonna warn any shoes.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:53.040]   - Yep.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:53.880]   - Got the ear.
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:54.720]   - You're relaxed.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:55.640]   Got the sandals.
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:56.480]   - No.
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.320]   (laughs)
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:58.760]   - John C. Devorak.
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:01:59.920]   Nice to see you once again.
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:01.400]   Tomorrow, you and me,
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:03.760]   we're gonna be statler and Waldorf to the radio industry.
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:06.200]   - Yeah, we're gonna blow their minds.
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:08.000]   - I hate radio.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.400]   - I don't know what we're gonna say.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:11.360]   It's the interesting. - I know what we're gonna say.
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:12.280]   - Yeah, good.
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:13.280]   - Not really.
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:14.120]   - No.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:14.960]   - 'Cause you go up and you know why?
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:15.800]   - You know why?
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:16.640]   - Analyze you, just gonna be ad-libbed,
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:17.640]   but it's not gonna be ad-libbed.
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:19.280]   - We've been thinking about this for years.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:20.120]   - We've been thought this for years.
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:21.480]   - Fall into one of these patterns.
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:22.320]   - Absolutely.
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.400]   - And boom, we nail it.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:24.400]   - And then we go have dinner.
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:25.920]   - And where we going?
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:27.000]   - The village pub.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:27.920]   - Okay.
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:29.040]   - Now here's the deal.
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:29.920]   - Yes.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:32.520]   - So what we wanna do here is we want,
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:34.040]   they're giving us X amount of time.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:35.480]   We have to run over.
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:36.320]   - Oh, absolutely.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:38.440]   - At least 10 minutes until they panic.
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.280]   - Yeah.
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.120]   - And then they start, you know,
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:40.960]   "Oh God, get them off the stand."
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:41.880]   - You want to see a lot of this?
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:42.720]   - Yeah, a lot of that.
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:45.280]   - A lot of wrap it up, a lot of blood.
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.520]   - And somebody, and then the key is,
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:49.120]   you know you've got them when the woman
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:50.880]   that's always gonna be the one doing this.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:51.720]   - It's always, yeah.
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:53.640]   - She's gonna be up on the stage,
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:54.760]   inching toward us.
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:56.400]   - And they'll be the Jaws theme.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:58.040]   - Doo doo doo doo doo.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:02:58.880]   - No, that's right.
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.760]   - Then they'll cut our microphone,
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.280]   just like the Oscars.
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:03.520]   - That'd be cool.
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:04.920]   - Play us off, play us off.
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:05.760]   - Play us off.
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:07.280]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon at 3PM Pacific,
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.960]   right after the hot new This Week in YouTube show.
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:14.040]   We're trying something.
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:15.120]   We're trying, we'll see.
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:17.400]   It's with Lamar Wilson, we're doing a kind of a YouTube.
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:19.080]   It's fun, I think, you know.

[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:26.160]   or 2300 UTC at Twit.tv.

[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:43.840]   - So why am I doing this on Twit?
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:45.960]   - Just, they're a big friends of the whole network.

[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.240]   San Jose, that's the place to go.
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.080]   Mm-mm.
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:08.400]   - It's a destination wedding.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:13.800]   - Not Sunnyvale, now Sunnyvale, I might mock.
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:14.800]   - Well, maybe.
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.120]   - But San Jose, it's got some nice--
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:18.080]   - It's got a lot, it's gonna have the 49ers shortly.
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:18.920]   - That's right.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:20.600]   - Or the Santa Clara, I'm not sure.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:23.160]   - Thank you for joining us, we'll see you next week.
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:24.240]   I hope.
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:25.800]   What, anything?
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:26.640]   No?
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:27.800]   - Tickets at Twit.tv.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:30.360]   Tickets at Twit.tv if you'd like to join
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.760]   the rapidly dwindling crowd.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:34.720]   - You need tickets.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:36.160]   - There's five people left.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.000]   - You need tickets?
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.160]   - No, we just like to,
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.160]   well, I don't know how many people
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:40.160]   are gonna do this when we can put out seats
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:41.000]   and get you pieces.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.280]   - You got enough people.
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:45.520]   You got like 100 seats in three people here, come on.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:46.680]   - I mean, what happened by the way,
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:48.840]   when this show first started out--
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:49.680]   - It was huge.
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:51.480]   - It was packed, packed and always packed.
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:53.840]   - And when, this afternoon it was packed.
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:55.320]   It wasn't even like, you're not talking,
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:58.960]   you know, 95, you're talking, this afternoon.
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:00.920]   And then as we talk, there's seats.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:03.560]   We gotta do this, we gotta get Oscar,
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:05.480]   like the seat fillers that they have for the academy.
[02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:06.320]   - Why they can't rush in there.
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:07.160]   - You need seat fillers.
[02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:09.360]   - Yeah, they actually pay them.
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.600]   - No, I can't do that, that would be messed up.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.480]   Thank you, Berch is filling a seat.
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:14.800]   - This takes a seat, good man.
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:16.880]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:19.760]   - I'll join you next week for another fabulous episode.
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:22.800]   Now ladies and gentlemen, another Twit is in the can.
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:24.320]   - This is a beautiful lady.
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:26.900]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:28.580]   - Do it the Twit.
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:29.420]   - Do it the Twit.
