[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   here he is tall and too cool and
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.280]   Taught tan and lovely Tom Merritt of DTNS. I wasn't sure who you're
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.800]   Well, we're it's astrogeo baritos 75th birthday today, so I had honor that it's great to see you Tom
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.880]   Good to see you too. Thanks for having me back daily tech headlines.com
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.760]   And he still has the impenetrable Twitter handle ace detect. Yep. Good luck. Good luck spelling that
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.560]   You know what now it's an asset not not having a handle that anybody could figure out. That's actually an asset
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.840]   It proves it proves that people really want to follow me
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.920]   Exactly. Hey, I recognize that chuckle. It's Christina Warren great to see you again from Gizmodo
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.840]   Yes, great to see you too. Thanks for having me always always always a thrill
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.880]   Late of Mashable now of Gizmodo. We should probably say that so people don't think I got it wrong
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.360]   at film underscore girl on Twitter and I think although I'm sure I'll get corrected if I'm wrong his first time on
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.400]   Twit Steven Levy is here thrilled to have
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.840]   One of the greats in tech journalism and I and I mean that sincerely Steven your book hackers is
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.680]   Literally the best book ever written about the computer revolution even though. That's very nice. What is it now 30 years old?
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.640]   32 I guess Wow Wow and yet if you haven't read it folks you've got to read it
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.160]   It's all about the original MIT hackers who right over there on that shelf. Yep. Yeah, Steven
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.760]   I have to be a little bit of a fan girl between my husband and myself. We have four copies of hackers
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:03.360]   You'd think that's the only thing Steven ever wrote, but of course he's written no awful lot
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.080]   This time for another one. I think don't you think you know, I I'm often wonder you know
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.840]   The best computer books the ones I've always liked are Tracy Kitter's soul of the new machine hackers books about
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.040]   Pascal Zachary's show stoppers books about kind of the what really happened behind the scenes behind the headlines
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   And I feel like there's nobody does it better than you Steven and of course everybody can follow Stephen's writing now on back channel
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.240]   Which is weirdly on medium?
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.720]   But owned by Condi Nast
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.320]   Is that did I get that right? That is correct. We started on medium and
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.920]   I was really excited to after all these years about writing
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.520]   about companies like medium to leave Condi Nast actually had to join it
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.640]   Because you were at Wired yeah, I was at Wired
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.960]   I was in Newsweek and I moved to Wired and then I was wired full-time for six years and wired
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.040]   you know, I love I've always loved why or I started writing for it when it first started and
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.520]   But the idea the chance to start my own publication
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.280]   This company headed by F. William is why I really admire was really fantastic and
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.920]   then we had an opportunity to
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.280]   Move luck stock and barrel to Condi Nast and still be on medium. It was a win-win
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.600]   and
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.320]   Everyone benefited and now I'm back literally of the same floor of the World Trade Center that I would have been had
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.640]   I stayed at Wired so it was kind of an interesting circle, but now I'm in a different position at Condi Nast
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.480]   I'm not only writing but the editor-in-chief of my little publication. We have a fantastic team Jesse Hempel another
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.600]   fantastic right tech writer one of the she's one of the greats she joined us with the move so
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.760]   It's not just me. It's her and other great contributors. We talked about Scott Rosenberg. He writes for us
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.440]   and
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.560]   We have a fantastic executive editor
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.480]   Sandra Obson who came with me from medium. There she is. You can see her with that picture there
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.640]   That little thing there on the left with the our team. We're having our first event in a couple weeks
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.280]   It's a breakfast with Susan Lyon
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.520]   And it's going to be a very small breakfast and back channels very much into building a community of its readers
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.200]   So we're doing a small breakfast where people really get to participate and talk to each other and we're pretty excited about that
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.320]   Where are you gonna do that own New York at the Ace Hotel in New York? Yeah, I
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.480]   Wish I could be there for that. That sounds like a lot of fun
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.560]   I would love to do that and I'm an avid back channel reader. In fact many of the stories
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.240]   We talk about probably today as well are from back channel in fact
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:55.720]   I'll start with a story. It's kind of your cover story if you have one on a back channel the iPod is 15 years old
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.140]   Not at ship date, but it's announced date was 15 years ago. I think on Friday
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.520]   I think yeah and boy, that's kind of hard to believe 2001
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.080]   The Apple at 15 years on the one hand is not long
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.800]   But we're light years beyond what the iPod represented the first iPod 5 gigs
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.920]   Yeah, you know, I have more than that my walk it. Yeah, I have almost that much of my watch
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.840]   right
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:30.720]   And of course it was a black and white screen it has spinning hard drive not solid state a spinning click wheel and it had
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:37.640]   To be charged and and and filled with fire by a firewire cable, right pretty amazing
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   All technologies long gone
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.440]   Even even that spinning hard drive inside has been abandoned by yeah, well, it's interesting
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.560]   so I wrote that it was kind of an email story as well as an iPod story because
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.600]   Actually that anniversary crept up on me. I think it's probably a little earlier in the week of October 23rd
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.360]   Oh, yeah, yeah, right and we could go and I saw someone else wrote about it
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.040]   They actually had a picture of the
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.280]   My news week cover that I wrote about it a few years later and I thought wow
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:13.120]   I should do something about this actually wound up eventually writing a book about the iPod and I went back into my email from
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.320]   October
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.480]   2001 and it was just like like falling into a time work
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.240]   You know this one if you keep your emails us what can happen there John Podesta might not be
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.840]   But but I but it was amazing if you're
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:37.720]   Remember October 2001 was a really weird time for a lot of us. I was working for Newsweek
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:46.720]   After 9/11 yeah, and we were obviously you know full boor covering what was happening post 9/11
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.320]   And we had the extra
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:56.720]   Little twist that some people thought that and rocks had been mailed to us in our office one day
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.840]   We had people on bios who's walking around and someone in the art department had the flu and we thought oh my god
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.600]   We're all dead and they made us I actually reprinted part of the email
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.160]   they had to get our mail in separate rooms you had to put a gloves before you touch the mail and
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.600]   and that was sort of a backdrop of
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.520]   Getting this mail from Apple saying yeah, we're coming out with this device
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.800]   And I said well, I don't think I'm gonna go out there. I'm busy covering the end of the world here
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.360]   and they said well don't worry what we'll can deliver you an iPod and and is
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.880]   There it is you know and here we'll set up this interview with Steve for you Steve Jobs
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.160]   Which is what happened there and I talked about that and lay it out and wind up?
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.480]   revisiting something that I wrote about actually
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:54.560]   In Newsweek and then later in the book about the time a day later when I went to a dinner because Windows XP was rolling out
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.120]   And they were doing rolling in up New York
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.200]   Which was a big vote of confidence for the city really Julie on he was there and everything
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.760]   But but maybe for the launch they had a dinner. I sat next to Bill Gates and pulled the iPod out of my pocket
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   Which he hadn't seen we got to show
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.800]   Gates a rare opportunity to one-up Bill Gates
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.720]   Well, is he interested?
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.920]   Yeah, he was fascinated with it. You have the you know that the text there
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.400]   It was you know
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.040]   I just handed it to him and then it was just him in the iPod having this moment together
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.800]   And you know he was impressed
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.520]   Yeah, okay, although little surprise that it was only for Macintosh
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:42.040]   But that didn't last long Steve eventually figured out that this was a product that everyone could like and was actually a
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.640]   change in direction for Apple
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.000]   instead of just promoting the
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.400]   platform of the computer he realized that there was a big opportunity for Apple to
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.120]   Lead in the I guess what some people call the post-PC era and that's exactly what happened now
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.120]   You know you might say this is the first you know the beginning of the post-PC era in some ways
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.200]   Yeah, I mean, I know that I have a Mac because because of this I had an iPod
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.720]   Yes, you had this first I used Max and in school
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.240]   But when I went to college, you know, they were expensive and and and OS 10 was not great
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.960]   But the iPod was so fantastic that you know that Halo effect that everybody wrote about was a very real thing
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.200]   And so I had it with my Windows computer
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.640]   But I was like well, I want the whole experience according Walter Isaacson jobs went kicking and screaming
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:34.020]   Into into the Windows version. He did not want to do that and had to be convinced to make a Windows version of iTunes it would work
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:40.440]   With the yeah, the first the first one the first Windows iPod because it came out in like September of 2002
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   I think so a little under a year after the first one came out
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.080]   Didn't have iTunes and use music match jukebox. Well, that's right
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.560]   They didn't have iTunes didn't have iTunes and so iTunes didn't launch on Windows
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.180]   I don't think it's all like toper of 2013 or 2003
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.960]   I want to say yeah, cuz I remember they had the big Super Bowl campaign in 2004
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:06.100]   But I think it was like October 2003 that they finally brought Windows to the excuse me about iTunes to Windows
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:11.820]   You know, it's awesome about this. I had this is the original. It's no works if you find a firewire people to charge it
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.480]   Yeah, and configure out how to connect that to the wall
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.420]   But my songs are still on here. This is kind of interesting. This is like a time machine of
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:27.140]   The songs the thousand songs you were listening to in 2001. You could only pick a thousand songs back then. Yeah
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.400]   Yeah, yeah, I had to pick your your favorite that seemed like a lot. It seemed like a lot
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:37.780]   Yeah, let's fast forward 15 years and actually I'm really curious what you all think about this Apple had its event this week
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.320]   It's October event. No iPads no no
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:47.240]   iPods no iPhones it was all about Mac and Tasha not even really all about Mac and Tasha all about
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.220]   MacBook Pros no mention in fact at all
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:56.920]   Of the iMac or the Mac Pro which is way overdue for an update at least we got new laptops
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:03.980]   But Apple which has turned its back even going back to Steve Jobs on touch screens for desktop computing
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.060]   Finally kind of acknowledged that maybe it had missed the boat
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.820]   At least that's my interpretation and put an OLED touch bar in place of the function keys
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:19.260]   I'm not saying anything anybody who's paying attention doesn't already know what's interesting is it was the day after a
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:27.180]   Microsoft event in which Microsoft kind of very clearly went off at went after Apple's core audience the creatives
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:34.740]   They to the point that they named the next version of Windows coming out this spring the creative edition and introduced their first
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:41.220]   Micros this is weird just saying Microsoft's first desktop computer. They'd never made one before a
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.980]   28 inch all-in-one
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:52.060]   Dubbed the surface studio Apple pricing at $2,999 or the base unit and lo and bow
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.900]   I mean you might say well
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.500]   We've seen an iMac that was almost 15 years ago that first lamp iMac came out
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.820]   But this one lies almost flat on the table at a 20 degree angle like a drafting table
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:07.620]   And it's clearly aimed at the designer the artist the musician the writers the people that Apple has
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:13.900]   Traditionally owned and it's caused some creatives to say I'm moving I'm giving up
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.060]   Tom is did Apple miss the boat
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:24.220]   Well that depends on who you are right if you're somebody who looks at that and says that's the device that I was waiting for
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.860]   Then yeah the service to you yeah
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:32.140]   Yeah, if you're somebody who's just says you know what I like OS 10 reliability and I need a laptop then no
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:38.660]   They they didn't they haven't done anything with Windows that would make someone who loves OS 10 switch
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.860]   What they've done is said Windows now has a bunch of things you didn't think of Windows being able to do
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:49.200]   Yeah, and if that's one of those things that you've been wanting to do particularly on a touch screen
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.620]   My friend Scott Johnson is really intrigued by this
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.900]   He's a cartoonist drawing right and he's like I don't have to get a wake-up tablet. I can get a surface
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:04.860]   Tablet or maybe even the surface studio you don't need the centique which is $1,500 by itself
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.460]   Yeah, and for the big centique the 27 inch one is actually $3,000
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:18.460]   $3,000 now it has more pressure sensitivity points, but it's lower resolution and is literally just a tablet and some have pointed out this ad that
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:24.900]   Microsoft showed for the new surface studios very appily is oh, it's so Apple
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:34.380]   Including I wrote that you know I was shocked the not to hear Jonathan. I know he's the thinnest Windows PC
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:42.060]   Well and the Google Pixel ads are also very Apple like well that shows Apple's influence doesn't mean they're they're you know
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:48.660]   They're trying to eat apples lunch. It just shows Apple's influence on advertising although it does it is lustworthy is it not?
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.020]   Oh, it's beautiful
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:56.180]   I mean I got a few minutes to play with it at the event on what was that like it was Wednesday and it was very very impressed
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.060]   Especially for such a niche device
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.820]   Very very impressive niche in a number of ways although it makes sense if you think about Microsoft as being
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:11.300]   The creator of Windows 4 OEMs. They don't want to get Dell and and
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.380]   Right, and Novo and everybody mad at them. So here you make a device that is clearly not gonna
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:21.220]   Eat much of their business the OEM's business and yet can show what Windows can do
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:27.180]   It's a it's almost a reference design as much as one of the interesting reactions to the daily tech news show audience was people saying
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:33.140]   They went on and on and on when they introduced Windows 10 creators edition about how this was for everyone
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:42.260]   You didn't have to be a computer expert, and then they come out with this in their opinion insanely expensive computer like that's not a price for this is not for everyone
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:49.220]   No, yeah, influence though by the surface table which came out remember when they announced the I've had in 2010
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.900]   Microsoft said oh wait a minute. We've got something like that which is a big-ass table and
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.620]   I was supposed to sit you're supposed to use it in the barroom or something like that play a game
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.540]   Yeah, and you know this kind of stuff was interesting. This is this
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:10.220]   Stuff this minority report stuff has been around for a while Microsoft has had it in the research lab
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:16.340]   They hired this one engineer who sort of did it on his own, you know Johnny the chong I believe his name is and
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:24.340]   I don't think he's called Microsoft, but there's his legacy and Microsoft has had this wrap of things could just sit in the
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:30.820]   Research Division and Fester for years and years and years. This is a case where they finally did bring it out and
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:38.740]   and it's getting a lot of applause and flaws and kudos and things like that a lot of people are saying now that
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.380]   Microsoft is more innovative than Apple and I actually
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:49.860]   Googled that phrase in there and there's like about 30 tech publications that said it. I think that's a little too
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:55.100]   Fast-all. I think that it's more accurate to say that Apple is now in position
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:03.140]   That Microsoft was in during the 90s of being the dominant company in the dominant platform
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.860]   Which is mobile right so they can't really
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.660]   innovate as
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.660]   drastically as
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.900]   The content that the would be they've inherited Microsoft's legacy problem
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:22.260]   Exactly exactly so you see how slow they are in a total redesign of the iPhone
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:29.380]   Yeah, you know, we've been getting these increments what they do is they usually do one big innovative feature and that's okay
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.580]   That's the next iPhone whether it's a you know the new number or an s right?
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:40.740]   Yeah, so you can see it's painstakingly, you know deliberate as to how they evolve this leading product
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.940]   Because you know people still buy it
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.540]   They had a really lucky break this time around with the Samsung's phones catch fire all the time
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.460]   No, and they're off the market. That was gonna buy it
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:57.900]   I don't think the pixel is gonna roll out in any kind of the numbers that'll threatened Apple
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.300]   Pixels problem of course is you can't get it at carriers except for Verizon and even T-Mobile
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.900]   Which said oh, we're gonna have a big pixel announcement. They're big announcement was buy it from Google and you could bring it to T-Mobile
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.620]   That's not how you get to market really. I mean now
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:18.740]   And even in the Verizon stores, it's not clear how much the salespeople will push it as the phone the Android phone to buy
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:24.460]   That means to be seen so yeah, basically Apple has a clear coast this Christmas
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.780]   Anyone's buying a phone. You've got to think of Apple first
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:34.180]   Well, and I think the key is if you're doing a long-term line like laptops
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:39.620]   Which arguably are declining for everybody so Apple's bucking the trend a little bit by maintaining a
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:46.860]   Smaller decline than other people you innovate very slowly you say look reliability and familiarity are good
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:55.060]   What Apple hasn't done which I think people are noticing here is come up with something that stuns you like the iPad or the iPhone did and
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:00.140]   Microsoft hasn't put out an all-in-one PC before and they put out one with some really cool design
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:05.940]   Yeah, it feels though part of the problem isn't it's not exclusive to Apple is that
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:11.220]   It's hard to think of what more you could add to a smartphone that would make people gasp
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.260]   Are we kind of almost to the perfection point where?
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.300]   You can't get another no Steven you
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:25.540]   What do you think there's some magic lying out there that we haven't plumbed yet? Absolutely
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.980]   That's their job to do that to find those things, you know and
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:36.220]   Are they are they unable to find it or is it more that they just can't leave
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.540]   Their legacy customers behind
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:44.220]   Um, you know you'd have to really go behind closed doors in Cupertino to answer that question
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:50.500]   But if they're not working on something which is mind-blowing for the phones then shame on that
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.420]   Because that's their job. Yeah
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:59.980]   And meanwhile a number of creatives are saying that this new these new laptops are
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:05.300]   Pro in name only that that is a marketing term. They tap out at 16 gigs of RAM
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.140]   Which anybody uses Photoshop realizes is the bare minimum?
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:14.980]   Well, I mean I think that's more of a limitation of the processor than Apple claimed it was to save battery life and I think
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.100]   You've got to really wonder about apples. It seems like
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:24.700]   Drive to make things thinner and lighter at the expense of power
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.700]   It's prosumer. It's prosumer. It's not pro
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:34.460]   So here's the forgotten member of the Apple family everyone talked about oh
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:39.260]   Shall I get this with a MacBook Air and Apple seems to be saying to you?
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:45.260]   Well, don't really think about the MacBook Air because he made this a spin they actually compared this, you know
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.700]   favorably with it with with the MacBook Air, but then Apple has this
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.340]   MacBook right just plain MacBook this beautiful 12 inch computer
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:22:01.660]   Which was woefully underpowered and I really thought that they were going to get the announce of version of the 12 inch MacBook
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:07.740]   Which was going to be more sufficiently powered. That's what the rumor mill seemed to indicate that was gonna the 13 inch would be a MacBook
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.100]   13, but it really is just a stripped down MacBook Pro. Yeah, you know you got it. You have it
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:18.740]   I do I have a lot of money. Let me see how thin it is hold it up to the very very very thin
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.020]   Air competitor except it's 300 bucks more than the air. That's the only negative, right?
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:30.140]   And so this is the one that does not have you know the touchscreen obviously just has the regular function rose
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.260]   How's the keyboard? It's the same as the MacBook
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:40.180]   I hate the MacBook keyboard, but but they read it's the same travel, but they readjusted the way that the butterfly
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.180]   Switch mechanism works so it actually feels better to type on
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:48.700]   So it's it's good because I make so many mistakes in the MacBook
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:54.220]   Yeah, so it's a weird mind-frock and that the travels the same but in my experience like I could tell them how it feels
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:59.460]   It feels better. Yeah, but the key size is the same and the distance between the keys is the same
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.820]   And that's the same keyboard that you're gonna see in the other Mac Pro models
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.260]   Yes, it's the exact same keyboard the difference is obviously like the other ones will have the
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.620]   OLD touch stripper retina touch strip whatever
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:16.180]   Technology is at the top and you know the the cheaper machine just has the two
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:22.220]   I think for a MacBook here the other okay, so you lose out
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.980]   You have a better screen. Thank goodness because the air screen was really starting to look pretty pathetic
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:32.540]   But you lose the ports and you lose the price you lose the ports and you I think the price is the big thing
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.700]   Although Amazon is already selling the thirteen hundred dollar one for like eleven
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.540]   Eleven fifty they're already selling the store and B&H is undercutting it too
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:47.140]   You rarely see that Apple controls the channel so tightly you really do and especially not with new stuff where
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:51.300]   Literally brand new you can get eleven forty. That's that's a significant
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.500]   Yeah, so which to me
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.100]   I mean if I'm gonna make any sort of critique just not even getting into the merits of the MacBook step and whether you know the
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.940]   Touch bar is the future
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.580]   It's a new paradigm and a revolutionary way of computing as they called it or not
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.020]   I think that the price was the one thing that kind of stuck out to me is being a little bit off
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.540]   I understand that they're putting a lot of technology in this
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.080]   I understand that it has an ARM processor and a secure element
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:24.360]   Yeah, the the OLED screen is really its own little computer with the same operating system as watch OS
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.140]   Yeah, and that's all very cool
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:33.020]   but the big critique that a lot of us have had and it and I'm a Mac user you know as much as I might feel
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.980]   Abandoned sometimes by certain things would like you know the perfect computer built just for me. I'm a Mac user
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.980]   I'm not gonna go to Windows. That's just not going to happen. I
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.380]   Do feel like the price point that they're starting out at is a little high
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.700]   And that's gonna be difficult. I think for some people to kind of justify
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.980]   You know 1800 dollars for a 13 inch laptop
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.540]   $2,300 $2,400 for a 15 inch laptop ironically pros
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:04.100]   Because they're buying something for work there. I don't think there is price sensitive. So I don't think price
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.660]   You're agreeing with it. Right?
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:17.300]   The but the pros but with the last version of the Mac book pros was great about them and some people say these were the greatest computers that Apple made really
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:24.700]   Was because the pros were not so much more expensive than the other models if you compared before yes
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:31.660]   Before last week you compare a Mac book pro to an air the Mac book pro was a much much better deal, right?
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:38.940]   And it max out the specs the the 2013 versions maxed out in the $3,000 range
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.340]   Oh, no, we got up to 4,000 these got up above 4,000 exactly
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.780]   So it's a 15 and and all you can get are pros
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:51.780]   I mean, yes, there is one Mac book version. Yes, there's the old Mac book air version, but they are very obviously
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.980]   tilting towards Mac book pros and yet not
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.260]   targeting the
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.980]   Upward professionals. It is a prosumer model
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.540]   I don't have a problem with them dropping the air because they've got a very thin and light look
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.740]   They had to improve the screen. Yeah, they're all written and now they've got a very thin and light
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:14.260]   They've got a medium thin and light with this OLED list 13 inch and they've got so it the line makes sense
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:21.420]   Yeah, the problem is you cannot buy a loaded Mac book pro that does what they want pretended it could do
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:28.540]   They had the new LG 5k screen hooked up to it and you dock it and suddenly it's a workstation
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.100]   On your desktop and yet
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:39.780]   It's it really you know thunderbolt three drive arrays and but it really isn't because it's 16 gigs of RAM and it's the skylake
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:46.420]   Processor and it feels like they they I feel like Apple doesn't really care about that and it's admittedly a small market
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.740]   So why should they care about the pro?
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.660]   They look at this Mac Pro. This is ridiculous three and a half years in now and
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.420]   No update and I did no update in sight for the Mac Pro
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.700]   Which which is a shame because I think that's and I don't think they care
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.860]   They don't think they have to care about that market as much or they do think that that is an opportunity though for you know
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.340]   The the Microsoft of the world so does I agree?
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:14.740]   I think you know that that is actually I mean the first the first crack was with Final Cut 10
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.900]   I was at I was at NAB that year that it was announced and saw people
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.580]   Gasping and not in a good way for one of the first times and then a year later
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:28.820]   So many people had switched to premiere all our edit suites are running Dell PCs windows 8 and premiere
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.100]   Because we didn't have an upgrade path with the Mac Pro exactly
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.780]   They finally did come up with one but it was it was too late and and so at this point, you know when you're talking about three
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:41.300]   You know plus year old you know Mac Pro hardware
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:46.780]   It was a very extendable machine a very good machine the fact that you know it has you know
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.100]   As many thunderbolt courses it had as it has as it was fine
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.500]   But now everything's moving to Thunderbolt 3 and USB C and so
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:59.900]   What are people going to do you're kind of asking people to maintain two different ecosystems if you have you know a mobile workstation
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:04.420]   You know with your new Mac book pro and you're still having your professional, you know sweet with your Mac Pro
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.140]   I mean that that's a little bit odd
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:14.380]   Stephen are but really when we think about this our Apple and Microsoft fighting over a moribund category
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:20.340]   Anyway, art isn't the I mean is the PC even have is there any market for a PC except for this small
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.540]   niche of developers and and professionals
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:29.180]   Or I think there is there's a lot of people who still use laptops, you know millions of sold every year
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.460]   It is shrinking though
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.500]   It is shrinking you know Apple has said the you know
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   Tim Cook in particular has said that he feels that for what a lot of people do they should be happy with the iPad the power iPad
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.100]   That's crazy the iPad Pro right that's and for me
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:53.020]   I you know I don't I don't edit movies or things like that, but I just like a lot of storage
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.300]   Powerful word processor
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.980]   You know the usual music and movies and things like that and I like to take it along with me and
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.500]   You use a Chromebook Stephen
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.460]   You know it's funny
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:11.580]   I went to Nigeria a few weeks ago and didn't want to you know cross borders and things like that with my all my data
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.340]   So I took a chrome a Chromebook with me and it was perfectly fine
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.060]   And it took a pixel that's what I would worry about it
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:23.580]   I use though I use though I use a computer a lot where there's no good internet connection there
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.580]   and
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:30.100]   A Chromebook is not good if you're not connected to the internet. So that's out for me
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:36.540]   You know I actually was thinking you know I have a MacBook Air a MacBook Pro. Sorry for work
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:42.500]   And you know good then I got supplied with and I thought well G. This is a good time
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:48.820]   I was looking forward this announcement so I thought now I'm gonna buy a personal laptop to replace the MacBook Air I have there and
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:53.920]   Not quite sure if I'm going to be running out to get one of these things
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.500]   I'm gonna have to get a lot of dongles and things like that in order to go with it
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.020]   It's gonna be a little more money than I thought I was a little disappointed that
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:10.700]   The basic things for 13 inch even the highest end 13 inch you only get 256 gigs of storage there and automatically I would 512
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:16.820]   You know so I all and as for the touch pad
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.420]   I'm gonna have to take a look at it and see if it really is revolutionary. I'm I'm optimistic
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.260]   I love to see what they do with it about a year ago
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:30.260]   It feels like the touch pad is Apple's kind of lame-ass way of responding to touch screens like well
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.340]   About a year ago I went to Apple
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:38.580]   They invited me actually to take a look at their accessories lab because they came up with new accessories
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:45.140]   And it was around the time of the iMac launch and I sat there and Phil Schiller and he gave me what I called the grand unified theory of
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.980]   Macintosh I remember that that was a great that was a great conversation
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:54.420]   Yeah, yeah, and he like laid out like you know well, you know if you do this this is only for the phone
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:55.820]   This he's kind of test for the phone
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:03.100]   This was for the iPad and this is for the laptop and this is for the desktop right and you know can I ask them specifically
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.460]   Well, what about a touchscreen?
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.460]   You know a lot of people thought that last I'm back but I have a touchscreen and he said no no no no no no
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:15.460]   That's wrong. That's wrong people you know like if their head is down, you know for the keyboard
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:22.660]   We when you work with it's ergonomically a disaster to touch the screen you get your gooey fingers on the screen
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.060]   It's just wrong right so this is
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.020]   Extension of that and the other thing is that
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.460]   Apple firm ever since the iPhone came out really
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:38.020]   They've been trying to make the desktop behave more like the phone right so the operating systems are merging there
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:44.260]   So this does a lot of things that are created because the limitations of a phone the thing
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.940]   I mentioned I wrote our newsletter about it this week is
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:54.820]   The one thing I saw in the demo that they gave is that it suggests words for you like it does for the phone
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:01.160]   Yeah, I thought you how how strange is that here's a feature that came about because you were weren't using a false
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.040]   full-fledged
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.540]   Keyboard right and you know because you're probably a type things wrong and it's a pain to type
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:11.500]   So they'll suggest the next word to you, but now they're doing it on top of the keyboard
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:17.300]   I think I have to reach all the way across that ridiculously large track back to get there so far far
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.200]   I
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.380]   Think Apple is saying it's wrong until the day. They say it's right isn't how Apple Apple works
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.280]   Yeah, they've got a rewrite OS 10
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.960]   Clearly and that was a painful process for Microsoft Windows 8, which was the transitional
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   Operating system to touch was horrid and and and Microsoft suffered from that
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.700]   But they've gone through the fire and now they come out the other end with this surface studio, which I
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:51.420]   Think proves that Apple's wrong about touch. I think this shows that touch is exactly what you want
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.680]   And well, I mean I think for those I think for what the surface studio is good for touch is good
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.640]   I don't think that for a lot of other applications
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.800]   Type you do an Excel spreadsheets or you're writing your your column for medium probably not
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:09.680]   Well, and I think that's what happens. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, cuz I'll tell you when I use my surface book pro
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.860]   I find that I rarely ever touch the screen, but
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:18.120]   Every once in a while you touch a button because it's more convenient
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.560]   There's a big button there than getting them out you touch it, but it's not like when I switch over to a Mac
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.680]   I suddenly find myself constantly trying to touch the screen. I do you don't touch your screen. Oh, no, I know
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.920]   I don't oh, I do all right, so not even switching from Windows 10, but switching from iPhone and iPad
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.120]   Constantly touching the screen
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.760]   So here's an interesting idea
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:42.240]   So we also learned that Apple was getting out of the standalone monitor business, right?
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.920]   Yeah, she'll are responded to that what if
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:51.960]   Either they're working with or someplace on its own some third party is working on the equivalent of that
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:58.760]   Big thing in the surface studio that you could use as an Apple peripheral with it what else comes out
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:05.240]   Yes comes out with the equivalent of what we've seen there that works with your laptop the way
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:11.960]   You know, I think that's why you have to rewrite Windows. I mean Mac it touch though
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:18.360]   I mean, I mean small go ahead. I'm Christine. I was gonna say the way comes the centiques work with Mac
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.560]   You know, you can use the tablets. So I mean, there's an idea, but I agree with you
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.320]   I think that they'd have to rewrite it. I will say this though when I was playing with the the new Macs
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.920]   I
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.360]   Kept almost touching the screen, which has never happened to me before but when I was playing with the touch bar
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:40.000]   I kept reaching up and almost touching the screen and that was a first and and I've long thought that Apple didn't actually need to go
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.680]   Touch for the Mac
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:48.120]   But I think that it's indisputable to say that their way the touch bars at least their way of saying this is we're doing touch on our
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.400]   Terms, you know, this is this is bringing some of those features people want
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:58.640]   But we're going to do it on our terms. I know it looks so dopey. You see they had they they brought out a DJ
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.160]   And it looks so dopey
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.960]   For the guy to be using this little touch thing to do his things weren't yeah
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.680]   He could just get a iPad and and do it all on the screen
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:16.680]   Well, they do seem to be tilting the iPad to be the replacement for the MacBook to say like look
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.680]   If that's the kind of thing you want then get an iPad pro or get an iPad
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.880]   We're gonna we're gonna have the laptops be serious laptops
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:29.040]   Do they come out with larger iPads then that are like that's the touchscreen interface?
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:36.680]   Well, they have they have a pretty large eye the I first I've had frozen. Yeah, you could surf on it
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.240]   Yeah, I always want to serve drinks on it. I feel like it's although
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.120]   Yeah, I have that in a 15 inch laptop
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.560]   And so I think of it as smaller like but do we I guess what I'm saying is do we want a 15 inch touch iPad Pro?
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.800]   I just I can't I don't know, you know, we're not gonna get the surface studio till
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.920]   December 15th, so
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:03.080]   I'll get the Mac Pro before then but I just I think that surface studio is even and I'm not an artist
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   I could draw stick figures is just
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:11.720]   Looks like the the kind of device that Apple might have made if Apple were still Apple
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   And I hate to say stuff like that
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:23.440]   But you you know, what was the name of your book on the iPod Steven was what the one perfect the perfect thing the perfect thing
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:29.040]   Yeah, and really for as a music player it was
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.280]   Perfect in the way that a lot of digital devices
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:40.720]   Since are perfect, right? I remember when the flip camera came out, right? Yeah, that that was perfect too
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:47.600]   Now it turns out we have a nice place. It's the perfect camera the perfect music player everything right, but but you know
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.200]   I have to say the iPhone 7
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:56.560]   Technology allowed is as close to that perfect thing. It is it's okay at least an industrial design
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.880]   That that the iPod was by the way, I have
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.080]   Pylers so you say you say the Apple isn't Apple anymore
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.180]   They just hold the eye but well and I have to say that the
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:10.120]   Civilization but you know, especially the jet black
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.720]   I mean there when you hold in your hand and you compare it to a pixel
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:18.440]   You realize that in terms of industrial design. I don't know where Johnny Ivis. I think he's on sabbatical
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.440]   But in terms of industrial design
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.720]   They still have it in that respect that's a black is amazing
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.480]   But I got to really wonder what the MacBooks are up to you by the way
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.680]   I have powered up my iPod and you want to see my playlist
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.440]   For rock and pop the number one song
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.880]   Britney Spears hit me baby one more time
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.200]   Class of 2001 it's a great year. You drive me crazy
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:50.000]   Old man three years later. I'm still listening. It's still it's still great today
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.040]   I can't believe you know the year that blows me away course. I do have a 16 years old. It's great, right?
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:02.880]   Soda pop I don't know what that is even is anyway, well, I guess I'll have some listening to do we're gonna take a break
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.400]   This is fun. I love this panel Tom Merritt is here from the daily tech news show
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.960]   Great to see you Tom
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:16.560]   Here's your set looks exactly the same ours has changed but yours has it just never changes. I love it
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:23.280]   Is that a functioning fireplace? Yes, it is. Wow. It is not a green screen. We have a fake fireplace here
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.160]   Yeah, I haven't cleaned the chimney in a while so I'm a little bit nervous about setting one up
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.860]   Yeah, see our fire is burning over here
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:35.040]   But it actually exudes zero warmth otherwise Steven would be really torching right now
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.320]   Steven Levy is also here from back channel calm and Steven Levy calm and
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:46.200]   Of course Christina Warren from Gizmodo and we're thrilled to have all three of you are sure you can take a break folks
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:51.360]   As they used to say in the army smoke them if you got them are sure today
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:57.440]   Are sure to tell please are sure today is brought to you by blue apron
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.960]   I want to talk cooking right now and I know it's a you know tough thing you work nine to five
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:08.360]   You're at the end of the day and you know my wife and I work together and this is the question I dread at the end of the day
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.960]   What's what are we gonna do for dinner?
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:18.200]   And it's and it's dawning to think oh now I have to plan a meal shop for a meal and cook the meal and that's why
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.160]   Thank goodness. There's an eye hop just around the corner
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:26.000]   And you don't want to end up frankly at the Burger King the Chipotle the eye hop the Applebee's every night
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.960]   Well blue apron is the solution blue apron day is our my favorite day would get home on the porch
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.520]   The refrigerated box containing three different meals
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.080]   Delicious meals meals we picked from the blue apron site
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:45.040]   Using ingredients that are fresh never frozen not even the meat of the fish because it's a refrigerated box
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.320]   Exactly the right ingredients for the recipe you get a recipe card with it as well
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:56.400]   So you never have too much if you need one clove of garlic you go one clove of garlic. There's no waste and by the way under ten
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.920]   Dollars per meal now if you shop for the same product at a grocery store
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.400]   It's gonna cost you 60% more blue a I think sometimes people look at this and go this is gonna be expensive
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:12.920]   It's actually more affordable and you're gonna cook it. What is that grilled ricotta cheese and beet sandwich is see that's amazing
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:18.560]   I mean, I don't know what it tastes like but that's amazing with persimmon and marinated fennel salad
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.720]   So these are exotic ingredients great recipes once you cook this you're gonna go wow
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:29.120]   I want to cook that again the nice thing is blue apron doesn't repeat the guarantee you unique
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.040]   recipes every day for at least a year
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:37.440]   And you're gonna use unusual ingredients you've never tried before but you're gonna make a wonderful meal
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.200]   They have plans for a couple plans for a family with kid-friendly ingredients
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.960]   And of course you're choosing exactly what you want
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:49.480]   So if a beet grilled cheese sandwich doesn't sound like heaven to you actually kind of looks good to me
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:57.960]   You can try crispy chicken milanese with warm Brussels sprouts celery and potato salad or how about a Thai green curry chicken and squash with
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:04.400]   You choy jasmine rice and cashews pork meatballs southern Indian squash curry. There's always something on the menu that's delicious
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.000]   blue apron's mission is
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.680]   To make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone while supporting a more sustainable food system while setting the highest standards for ingredients and building a community of
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.920]   home
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.080]   chefs and

[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:37.040]   Dot-com slash to it. You'll love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home cooked meals with blue apron
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.360]   And we thank them so much for their support of this week in
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.920]   Tech
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.840]   It was funny to see the surface dial. I was thinking what was the name of that power mate that the griffin made
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:54.920]   You guys remember that the little knob that you got with your Mac it was exactly the same thing
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:02.400]   I came to market that they had a couple of they had like a ruler and a pencil
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:09.640]   That the date they showed off that were that you put it on the iPad right exactly exactly kind of reminded me of that a little bit
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.120]   I'm a guy with the apple -
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:19.200]   Yeah, there's dials the key with the power was did it come with the apple tour you bought it was a power mate from Griffin
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.480]   Right yeah, Tom. We had you muted so yeah, Tom. We had a mute it
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.200]   So I don't know if you're muted now, but you can try well Leo. Yes, Tom
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   Yeah, no, I was thinking earlier
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.560]   when Stephen brought up the
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   Surface table that they talked about one of the things they showed off back then was being able to set your
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:44.440]   Down yeah and have it order another one and I saw the dial was the first thing I thought of was like well
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.200]   They basically took that recognition technology and figured out an actual use for it
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:55.880]   Microsoft's also go ahead. They have this cool tiles right on that yeah, yeah, like magic tiles
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   I wonder if they're gonna introduce those again
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:04.640]   So you put a tile there and it was sort of read right it would and would know what was on you put your camera there
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.480]   And it would show your pictures and you could sort them
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:13.240]   I ever saw that was on a cruise ship and a casino nobody else hotel lobbies
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:19.440]   That's all you actually saw what I saw it played with it was really it was all messed up because people have been putting their drinks on it
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:26.280]   Scratched up. What do you expect? It's not a good product. It was a bad idea, but you know what it lives on in the surface
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.920]   Studio Mike we should mention that Microsoft also is entering the VR
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:38.440]   Realm they announced less expensive VR headsets that are tethered unlike the HoloLens
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:43.500]   Which is untethered starting at two ninety nine and and in a very typically Microsoft way
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:50.440]   They're not gonna make them, but their partners a suit aces a sir Dell HP and Lenovo
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:56.280]   Are gonna make these and they have something that I had to ask somebody with this means six degrees of freedom?
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:04.040]   Which which sounds I'm not sure at the founding fathers it does it sounds like maybe something that was in the Federalist papers
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:11.080]   But no, it's the ability to go left right up down back and forth so without the external sensor all the axes
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.600]   That's because you're totally untethered from the six degrees of people
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.080]   100% degrees of separation. Yeah, I'm Kevin Bacon and everyone else
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.400]   It's funny to watch everybody
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.240]   Chase this market
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.960]   Even though I'm not convinced it's anything more than a gimmick. Are you Christina if anybody we're still in the VR would be you? I?
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.400]   Don't know I think that it has potential
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:44.880]   But I don't I mean right now so much of the focus has been on gaming and I think that I'm not convinced that out
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.240]   I mean there've been a lot of cases before kind of it broken it started to bring in the mainstream where it could be used
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.720]   you know in
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   Medicine and to help people with PTSD and I think that there are some interesting
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.040]   Use cases that you could obviously do even in like the industrial sector
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:07.680]   But when it comes to regular people I don't know if we're ever going to be at a point where people are going to be willing to put on a headset
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:15.080]   I just don't have to seize the world as a 3d it wants to it announced also it's new paint 3d which
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:22.280]   Answers a question. I don't think anybody's asking which is how can I make a 3d object on my PC?
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:28.720]   I mean obviously business for you know if you're making computer graphics for movies and stuff, but it can minecraft
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.480]   Is that it they I got the impression that they really felt that kids were just dying
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:40.160]   For a tool here. We are in a school where they could make 3d objects on their PC
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:46.240]   When I first heard 3d I was like it'll probably be really hard like bubble letters, but when I saw this
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.680]   I was like it's like yeah, it is like but it's like word art. I mean I don't get really
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:57.640]   Maybe there is a market for this. Is this a bunch of my is this Microsoft owns Minecraft after all right?
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.040]   Yeah
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.040]   And one little notice
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:07.920]   Announcement the apple event was that minecraft. Yes coming. Yes, right? Yeah to Apple there
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:14.160]   So maybe that's Microsoft's you know sort of answer kind of to extend you know that the role reversal of
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:20.360]   You know remember we were talking about the seismic
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:26.640]   You know reverberations when Apple made iTunes available for Windows there
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.800]   Maybe this is sort of a similar move there the showing the Microsoft isn't so
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.720]   Chain to its own system there. You know, they're not clearly
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:44.800]   We want to be wherever our customers are we're gonna make products that are cut if our customers using iPads
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:49.760]   We're gonna make and some of the best Microsoft products are for iPhone and iPad. They're not for right right so but
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.280]   This franchise that they're building there they're gonna be very
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.800]   ecumenical there I
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   Guess what I'm wondering is are we entering a future where kids want to do 3d they want to do 3d printing?
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:12.120]   Clearly Microsoft would love a cadre of young people who could design products for hollow lens
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:19.720]   And the new by the way one of the announcements with Windows 10 the creative edition is the Microsoft holographic interface
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:26.880]   They're you can't use it now, but eventually you'll be able to speaking a minority report integrate interact with Windows
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.120]   in a in a very kind of
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:34.320]   Virtual or augmented reality way that's gonna be built in the next version of Windows so
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:41.220]   Maybe it's just Microsoft saying hey you guys you need to learn these skills because we need you to write the next generation of operating systems
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:41.720]   Well, yeah
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.820]   I mean there's a ton of VR headsets Microsoft
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.560]   You know took less than 30 seconds to announce a bunch of cheaper VR headsets
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.500]   the ones that have phones that you put in them are
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:56.680]   Obviously more the more popular right now, but they're just change as it goes along
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.440]   And Microsoft saying we're the place where you can design stuff for that universe
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.280]   You guys that are young are already designing 3d stuff for the Minecraft universe
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.440]   And of course we've got the hollow lens coming out which we think will be a huge hit eventually
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.240]   So we need a tool for you to be able to design for that universe. Yeah
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.080]   Yeah
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:16.160]   All right, enough of Apple and Microsoft. I'm sick of them both
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:22.360]   No, actually, I'm not I can't wait to get both my hardware Christina. You don't have the OLED yet
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.940]   You just have no, I don't know. I just I just have the base model, but you did play with the OLED
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.000]   I did I played with the OLED and you thought it was great. I thought it was very cool
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.880]   Is it a gimmick or is it something that regular people will?
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.440]   You know that the professionals and people really want that I'm not sure about
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.960]   But I thought it was very cool and and I thought I was a little bit concerned
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.620]   That it would be weird to use that you would constantly be looking down at your
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.520]   Your keyboard and you wouldn't be able to see what was on the screen
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:56.000]   But I felt like I was afraid it would feel unnatural. It actually didn't it actually felt very natural, okay, but
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.280]   You know how useful it will actually be that I don't know because I was already thinking to myself, you know
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:06.600]   I'm I have so many key bindings, you know muscle muscle train to my memory, you know and and
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:12.120]   They use the function keys and so I don't know how that will work in an era with a touchscreen
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.400]   Turn on the setting that makes that strip be function keys by default
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.080]   Well, you can't do that and some number of people saying well
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.320]   How can I be a programmer now because I don't have an escape key or an F1 key?
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:27.440]   But in fact they showed a picture of an escape key so you can obviously in fact you could have
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:33.520]   VIM bindings if you wanted I guess on your on your OLED screen and well no though did this on the X10 a few years back
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.880]   Oh really it was it was a little more limited it could only do four key sets
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.160]   So it wasn't as programmable as this it wasn't in color
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:45.280]   And it it was neither a hit nor not a hit like as far as I could tell there weren't
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:52.320]   Significant complaints about it seemed to work fine, but people didn't also rave about how it really increased their productivity art lebadev
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:56.320]   You know
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:01.000]   That art lebadev ever released that keyboard he was gonna do with all OLED keycaps
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.360]   Remember that yeah, they did they did I thought it was I thought it was a it was very small quantity
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.440]   I understand and expensive it was a super expensive
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.160]   And then you know there's the rumor that they're going to be you know the 2018
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:21.120]   MacBook with the yank yank with the things. Yeah, I
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.960]   That's kind of interesting because they would be normal keys
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.760]   But they would be completely programmable. I don't know if I but
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:33.000]   To your point about muscle memory. Do you really want to be in that kind of shifting landscape?
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.440]   Like a key could be whatever it wants to be it's unintended Allen
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:42.840]   It sounds a very Alice in Wonderland. I a key is whatever I intended to be
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:51.040]   Let's let's as I said time to move on let's talk about vine speaking of moving on
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.200]   Three years and out
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.680]   I bet you made some vines in your time. In fact, I know you did for Mashable
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:05.240]   Didn't Mashable have a whole vine team we did have a whole vine team and and then the the person who headed up the vine
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.520]   Step originally Mashable went on to work at vine. He was the community manager at vine for a couple of years. Sorry
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:15.320]   Down yeah, yeah, no
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:22.400]   I'm not surprised but given the financial situations, but yet I am surprised because it just seems
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:30.560]   Russ Russ Yusupov who created vine and sold it to Twitter had a fairly pithy response to the announcement
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:35.880]   Never sell your company don't sell your company. It may or may not have been related to the announcement
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:41.000]   It could just been scroll down a little bit. I'm still on there you go. There's a tweet
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.720]   Just happened to come out at the same time for little words that say so much
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:50.600]   Yeah, but with the with those words come from the you know me or cat
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.280]   No, I think seriously Ben Rubens moved on to
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:01.440]   Well that disappeared too, right? They announced they were gonna do a social meerkat and that that was only a month ago
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.960]   Yeah, well in near has gone for the absolute but I agree with you Stephen
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.400]   I mean I think that as much as you might be you know pithy me like don't sell your company
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:13.520]   Well, no one else probably would have bought your company. So I don't I don't know I don't know
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.920]   He sold it they say for 30 million dollars Russ. I think you should take the money and run
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.640]   I mean the questions could he have made it on his own with that with could he have beaten Instagram, right?
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.560]   um
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:33.200]   Yeah, well and I read an article that there was a turning point with vine when all the vine creators
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.520]   I love the story got together. Where was that that I read that?
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.960]   This is mike mike wrote the story about how last fall
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:48.320]   I'll read you the first paragraph last fall nearly 20 of vines top 50 creators gathered in a conference room at 1600 vine street to station intervention
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:54.800]   And they're basically asked the stars had a proposal if vine would pay all 18 of them 1.2 million each
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.880]   Roll out several product changes and open up more direct lines of communication
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:04.400]   Everyone in the room would agree to produce 12 pieces of monthly original content for the app or three vines per week
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.480]   But their complaint was
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.280]   Oh vine you're not doing a good job. Nobody's watching us anymore
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.920]   right what I really wonder is
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:21.280]   Did you guys like uh, who are these who is who's the biggest vine guy? What's his name? Uh, bok king bok
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:26.560]   Yeah, did king bok go on to greater things after leaving vine?
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.880]   Yeah, he's he's making he's on snapshot. Yeah, but honestly
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:37.600]   Uh, could it be that maybe people just got tired of six second jokey videos and oh definitely
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.160]   I mean, it wasn't vines fault
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:45.280]   No, I mean, I think that they're they probably had a point that they wanted some product changes
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:50.000]   And there were probably things that vine could have done to talk to their creative community more and figure out ways
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   They wanted 1.2 million
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.640]   Oh, I agree, but I think that I think that the ask of 1.2 million each to create 12 pieces of content monthly
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.800]   Isn't insane ask you're not the cast of friends here. This is not no
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:08.080]   No, but not only that. I mean, it's just it's uh, I mean it completely outsizes
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.880]   I think their own influence um especially since most of them had
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:16.560]   You know because they'd already at that point moved on to other services snapchat or instagram or facebook or youtube or whatever
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:24.480]   Um, I mean and there were some there happened a few like legitimate artists that came out of i'm some of them have gone on leeley pons
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:30.800]   Uh shan men des shan men des shan men des is a musician and he was a vine star and
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.920]   Spotify named him number one 25 or 25 he opened for taylor swish last year on her role tour
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.400]   but that's
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.400]   That's six seconds long
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:46.720]   He would I interviewed him and it's bizarre to me. I'll be honest with you. I met the kid and I
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:53.280]   My internal responsibility. Yeah, good luck with all that. Um, I was wrong. He's gone on to be very successful
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.560]   But uh, yeah, he was he was there were a number of musicians who were making
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:03.040]   You know kind of like six second, you know musical things people would hear little bits of what they were doing and and they gained audiences that way
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:07.360]   But I mean, I think that to your point though. I think that just the the nature of the product
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.280]   I mean you could do a lot of humor and it was very good
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:15.360]   And and there were certain content there that was certainly very like big in the meme community and that people would adopt
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.960]   But I think that a problem with the service like mine for a company like twitter
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.840]   Is twofold one?
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.920]   Um, you know, you can't really guarantee that the stream of content that will come in that
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.000]   It's gonna be good enough that people are gonna watch it
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.080]   But I think the bigger problem is that you know something like instagram or even snapchat
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.320]   Or even youtube to a lesser extent
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.760]   Everybody feels like they can upload it
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.800]   You don't have to have an inherent talent to be able to get something out of it
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.800]   Everybody can take out their phone and take a photo and post it on instagram and share it with your friends and family
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.360]   To be really good at mine and to have people be to make compelling buying content. It's hard to do
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:54.720]   It's very hard. Yeah, you know stop motion september. It's also a very specialized skill that may not translate to any other platform
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.720]   Precisely
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.080]   And it was a launch platform
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:04.720]   I mean if you look at the majority of the vine stars were musical and they all made it big by moving to another platform
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.480]   And I think that was one of the most interesting parts about that story was youtube
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.880]   Which usually is getting flack from creators for not supporting them enough
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.760]   Talking them with with content. We're getting
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:22.880]   Pointed out as the example of like vine you need to do what youtube is doing giving us money helping support us
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.360]   And while that makes perfect sense for youtube
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:30.160]   I don't think it did make sense for vine vines not monetizing in the same way or at all
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:39.200]   Yeah, and and it's it's ephemeral content. You don't see snapchat out subsidizing artists. That's the question. What does this portend for snapchat?
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.080]   Well snapchat has had that now. No, you know now people are you know
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.320]   uh, they're gonna
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.560]   You know like pay for the content there and take all the advertising there
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:55.360]   So that's going to be a really interesting thing to see how that plays it ended up being uh the brands ended up being
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.360]   The big thing for snapchat, right?
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:04.480]   The brands would be even beyond that when you have um like your influencers like some of the bigger vine people are really big on snapchat
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:09.520]   And if you get like uh if you're verified on snapchat, you get like your own custom emoji or whatever they will run ads
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.520]   On your story. So they're okay, so they can't move on that. I'm sure yeah
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.920]   So I'm sure that they're getting a cut of that snapchat's running ads on them
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:19.360]   So like when I look at you know, Kylie Jenner's snapchat as I do every day
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.760]   Um, you know, there's ads. Yeah
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:25.600]   I mean genuinely everyone should it's actually really uh, it's kind of amazing
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:30.880]   It's a book that um, but uh, it's it's amazing to see what what youth is into
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:37.280]   Um, I I do love the teens, but um, no, but you know, they run ads on that and and so the people who are getting
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.840]   You know tremendous amount of views
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.640]   Are are potentially bringing in actual money?
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:46.320]   That way, but and they could never do that on vine because twitter
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.800]   I mean that's been one of their stories is they've had a really difficult time monetizing
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:56.880]   I think as well as everybody else in their space as all the filters snapchat had the filters that they sponsor all the
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.320]   Filters right those little filters are always sponsored. Yeah
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   Another thing that vine never had they never built on right right vines are on vine vine stay on vine
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:11.680]   But snapchat filter pictures for instance are everywhere else they're all over instagram. They're everywhere right people
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:17.440]   Well and vine the product at launch is still the product now at the end like they didn't they didn't expand it
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:22.160]   Didn't change it. No, they didn't. I mean they they they made it so you could upload other video like it in the early on
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:27.520]   You had to actually record with your phone camera and so when mashable was doing vine content in house
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:31.840]   That was you know tremendously difficult because we would literally have to have you know
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:37.920]   Jeremy who led it up for mashable and then when i'm gone going to vine, you know would would sit and spend you know
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:43.120]   Hours upon hours upon hours hours hours and hours to do stop motion stuff and have would have to do it all with
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.760]   You know his camera and you put in background music
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.000]   It's very primitive and then they did add more stuff
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.280]   So you could upload existing video and have different audio stuff and and have different tools
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:56.320]   But that came late and and again that's still very specialized whereas, you know
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.960]   You know something like youtube obviously you have a lot more options even with live stuff like facebook live
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.120]   There are a lot more options. So
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:10.320]   Is it though a larger story really because twitter cut 9% of its workforce vine which is a part of all of this totally
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.560]   You know and clearly if you can't monetize vines gonna gonna go
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:20.720]   Twitter's trying to show profitability and the only way you can do it or they're trying to get sold
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:26.800]   Yeah, well most of it is trying to get sold everyone but jacked or see is trying to get sold
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.040]   Jack just wants to make money. I mean
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.320]   Well, you're not gonna get it's gonna be difficult to sell well, there's a lot of
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.640]   Roblox to twitter sell there look there are but I think they're having
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.400]   Yeah
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:44.640]   I mean basically as it turns out the biggest problem they have in selling now is the troll problem is that sure
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.560]   Is that true because I saw that I saw mark banny off said that and it was
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:53.360]   Disney said that disney well reportedly disney said that nizzy and saying publicly
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.400]   Oh, I I trust blinberg's reporting on that. Yeah, they're good
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.120]   So and that makes sense especially for a brand like disney you don't want to be tarred
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.440]   With the troll brand that twitter brings to the table
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:10.800]   But I have to think that the real issue is two and a half billion dollars in revenue and zero profitability
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.600]   Yeah, I mean and I think that you know they have
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.600]   A
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.640]   Vine if you look at it was always a very different core product than twitter's core product
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:23.680]   You know twitter is all about the now and instantaneous and vine was was fun and and certainly
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.000]   Um, there are a lot of vines that I've enjoyed over the years and a lot of people who made really good content
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   And I think the community they built there
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   Um and kind of the outpouring of the the people who that community is leaving that's interesting
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.480]   It's always interesting to see you know communities get shut down and we haven't seen one that was you know this big so to speak
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.840]   Um
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.080]   Shutter in this way in quite some time and that's interesting
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:49.040]   But I think that the two products were very different and if you're a company who you're trying to get sold or you're trying to become profitable
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:55.280]   You've got to look at what your core what your core strengths are off the dead limbs and that was a dead limb if ever it was
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.800]   Yeah, I mean it was always run sort of as a startup inside of twitter anyway
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.960]   You know they had their own offices and and so it was different after disney and google and sales force
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:11.440]   Everybody else kind of withdrew from the buying twitter the conventional wisdom was oh, that's not a problem
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   Some investor group will come along
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.760]   Uh with the kahone's to fire enough people to make it profitable
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:25.600]   And that hasn't that doesn't seem to have been materialized if any of you heard of any uh inkling that somebody might be sniffing around it seems like
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:30.560]   Nobody just just the rumor that disney was was back interested in that last
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.280]   Before it went away
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.520]   Well, you know, I think there's there's a perpetual appeal for google
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.560]   So you know kind of this dance has been going on for many years of
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:49.680]   You know because obviously it's very valuable real-time information. It could be a great use to google
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.840]   Um, you know if the price was right, uh, face are they just waiting for the stock to tat to tank or
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:02.800]   Well, I don't know. I mean, you know for for google in particular there could be a regulation issue there
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.320]   Uh when when when they bought it, but then again if it got so weak
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.480]   Uh they could argue that look no one else wants to say how can you say that we're saving?
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.600]   Yeah, we're yeah, we're saving jobs or whatever
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.840]   It's not like google plus is really the same
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:22.960]   Ability in terms of the profitability, you know twitter is actually done a fairly good job monetization adam bane
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:28.800]   Who's you know the the business of twitter has done a fantastic job? The problem is
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.920]   It because it's not growing then you know, uh wall street is intolerating these losses
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.560]   Uh that they come through and most of the the losses if it wasn't for the you know money
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.600]   They pay out for competent options in in terms of the compensation things like that
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.760]   It probably would be profitable or they could jigger the numbers to make it profitable there
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.400]   The problem has always been for the last couple of years just there's a lack of growth stang it
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.760]   Less cool actually was their best their best growth order in a while
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.080]   It wasn't you know, gine busters, but uh it was moving the needle there
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.200]   And you look at the impact the twitter has on this election
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.160]   Uh, and how big a story it is
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.480]   You can't say that the twitter is in in some sense
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:17.840]   An amazing company. I like don't I like the idea that donald trump puts together trump dot tv
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.960]   And buys twitter and social arm and I love this idea. I want to see this happen
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.760]   Donald sort doesn't actually have that much money, but no, it doesn't need money. He gets people people sure
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.680]   Sure, but but don't you think steven? I mean I agree with what you're saying and twitter is certainly very important
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:37.120]   But don't you think that the fact that twitter has been so crucial to this election and has been such a big part of the conversation
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:42.080]   And it's arguably more relevant now than it's ever been in social discourse and it only
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.000]   um
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.960]   The growth was only what it was. I doesn't that represent. I mean, I I know why you know why because it's only it's only us
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.760]   That's the twitter as be it's a small
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.080]   Sliced society. I mean, I've said this so I've said this many times
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.520]   I mean I love twitter and I've built a lot of my career because of twitter
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.800]   But don't you think though?
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.000]   I mean, I think that maybe the problem when they want public and and certainly
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.080]   With their expectations on their roadshow was that they could have this this growth
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:16.160]   But the trajectory that you've sought seem to snapshot them with with facebook and with instagram and with other properties
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.800]   But it's just never going to be bigger than 300 million people
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.360]   I mean, I think that's just reached the number of people that it's going to reach
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:28.800]   And that's what the board and the stockholders are saying when they want to sell is this needs to go to somebody who can use that as it is
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.120]   Let's cash out and jack dorsey is saying no, let's lean into that
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.360]   Let's become a platform that sure it only has 300 million monthly active users
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.080]   But everyone consumes it sure everyone looks at it and so those are the two bets
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.360]   I'm not saying I know which one is is the better way to go
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.680]   But it's not unreasonable to think that dorsey's right that he can turn this into a new kind of of live event
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.680]   platform when people assume
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.400]   People become like a total loser
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:05.280]   I don't think it's a loser at all. I just think that that's the that's the cap of where it is
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.200]   That's not to say that 300 million is small
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:13.840]   First of all first of all half of those people are fake. I think that the real number is somewhat less than 300
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.040]   Well, okay. Okay. Let's let's assume that I don't actually think that's true
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.080]   But let's say it was 150 million that would still be tremendous
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.080]   I just that you know
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.800]   I fundamentally think that whoever buys Twitter or if Twitter stays, you know independent whatever happens
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.600]   They have to focus on the fact that the the days of growth they are never going to it's never going to be a billion user
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.400]   Entity it's never it's just not and that's okay
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.360]   It doesn't have to be but I think that the fact that this election when it's been you know used by one of
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:45.360]   By both presidential candidates, but but especially used by one is basically his central way of communicating directly with people
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:51.680]   It's become a crucial part of discourse and the growth was only like 3% and that was their best quarter in in years
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:57.760]   I think says that no matter how important it might be and no matter how good that that number might be like in
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.720]   In act, you know from a macro level. That's just as big as the companies ever going to get and
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.200]   Who you know the people who are making those decisions like Thomas saying or going to have to make the decision
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.400]   Um like to I think they just need to focus on the fact that this is never going to be a 500 million
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.800]   What if we stipulate that that's that that's a big enough number to be valuable and that
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:22.720]   In the last few months dorsey has shown that twitter can become a media platform in a very interesting way
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.520]   I think
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.880]   November 8th i'm probably going to be watching twitter as closely as I watch any television network, right?
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:33.840]   Well, you're but you're not going to be watching twitter. You're going to be watching is it buzzfeed or bloomberg? I can't remember
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:39.840]   Well, i'll be watching buzzfeed on twitter. Yeah, it's buzzfeed. Okay, but that's it, but that's on twitter's website, right?
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.760]   I mean that that has value. I think um, I think it's worth it
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.520]   He has made some very
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.560]   Significant changes that are probably the right direction
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.440]   I think he's got the right idea that twitter is essentially a participatory block broadcast platform
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.160]   Yes, and that people are missing that it's not either one. It's not a broadcast right? It's not a social network
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.880]   It's a blend of the two the question is can he pull that off
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:09.200]   To not only keep it as a business but make it attractive to advertisers and other monetization opportunities
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.200]   He may get the chance because I don't see anybody, you know getting in line to buy the thing
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.320]   But maybe there's behind the scenes
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.880]   You're right. Stephen google should buy it
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:25.040]   Google has has been talking and like just a number of times I talked to any number of people at google over the years
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:28.320]   And then yeah, maybe at one point it was like a billion dollars
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:34.720]   No point was 10 billion dollars and the discussion always went and there were some people who wanted to buy it and some people said no
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.920]   um
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.720]   And again at one point anything google did was a subject a huge regulation here
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.800]   Who's who's to say what would happen?
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.680]   If google how a bit alpha that should buy it
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.640]   Yeah, maybe that's different
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.400]   Yeah, well it is different. Have a chug every chinese wall. It was wind up in google
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:57.520]   I mean it would be crazy if google were to buy alpha that were to buy it. It would have to be google
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.800]   Yeah, you put it in youtube. I think even yeah, that's interesting. Oh, yeah
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.600]   Look at twitch twitch is essentially that right with the chat and the video at the same time
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.800]   Uh, that would be a very interesting play youtube is twitch is a social network
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:17.680]   Uh, in fact that was the other thing at the microsoft and as but I thought it was very interesting announcing essentially a twitch competitor
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.240]   Dean this thing
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.240]   So maybe i'm such a buy it
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.240]   They own twitch, uh, maybe maybe
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:31.120]   Well, they don't do they need it. They already have the the chat they already have that hybrid platform you were talking about tom
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:38.160]   Which you mentioned the steven's written the book for what google's thinking called inside the plex and I think
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:43.280]   It's the book and I think steven probably had better access into google
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.200]   Uh, than anybody we learned so much about what was going on inside the plex from uh steven's book. I presume you still have
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:58.800]   Uh good contacts in there. Yeah, well, you know, I do talk to people no one's told me where they're um, about the pull a trigger on twitter
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.280]   They are um, you know, they probably should get fired if they did tell me but
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:12.800]   Well, and probably I think I think I think that it's not a zero chance that google wants a twitter and with the stock and free fall
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:18.400]   Uh, you'd be foolish to bid too soon. You might just watch why not verizon
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.320]   Why not? Well, they want well they want add 10 so they can get twitter analytics
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.960]   That would be really good at tech. They also would have a customer service platform that they could sell out
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.120]   Yeah, and a platform to go with her
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:38.000]   Exactly and yeah, who and yeah, and I'll tell you one thing if Verizon buys twitter, that's the end of twitter
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.360]   Uh, incidentally twitter stock price has stabilized since october 7th, so
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.360]   um
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.080]   Can't wait much longer google flatline would be another word
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:54.160]   Stabilize flatline, you know, it's
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.280]   difference amongst friends
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:02.160]   Uh, let's take a break great panel steven levi from back channel

[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.040]   But i'm still confused about the thunderbolt port. So could I like this regular usb?
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.120]   Will that fit in the thunderbolt or do I have to get it?
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.520]   No, and those ports are multi-function ports
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.320]   So they do all of your other things as long as you have a dongle to do it

[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:43.920]   I don't know what's coming out of us. It isn't it nice not to have to worry and just come to the news as it emerges instead of thinking ahead
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.320]   Yeah, definitely about what there is to say
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.640]   um

[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.640]   We all gonna whether for phones or whatever we're all going to have different assistance there whether it's viv or your samson phone

[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.840]   Some of them are gonna do different things than the other ones so we're gonna have to figure out
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:13.920]   You know who's going to do this there and maybe you could just ask them saying okay
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.560]   Jump ball who waters me the uber here?
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:25.040]   This is as bad as the situation right now with smart tv appliances where you have to have more than one because no one no roku
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.360]   roku can't play i tunes and i tunes can't play amazon and
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.400]   It's just annoying as hell can we just
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.720]   I want one virtual assistant i could talk to
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:43.120]   That that learns because you because you want to use one regularly so we'll learn your habits and your needs and your interests
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:51.600]   I just comes down to who's a api is going to be more open there there. So you know right now amazon is leading the api
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.720]   sweepstakes there they
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.440]   They have more people using us apples trying to open up a little more you know siri
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.040]   Actually, you know, it's funny after a couple of years siri had fewer
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:11.760]   Outside parties using you know, it's platform then it did when apple bought the app open table used to work with siri
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.360]   And then apple bought it. Yeah, well now it does again, but um
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:23.840]   The you know, but then there's this other one these guys who left apple literally the day that siri was launched and the day
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.400]   Steve jobs died
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.000]   You know, uh, they did this thing called viv i did a huge story about it
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.840]   For wired and samsung fought them a couple weeks ago
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.680]   So that's going to be the samsung assistant there
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:43.680]   And that's the one that's the i think is going to be the most open because anyone could just write to them and it's going to be
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:50.000]   Uh an easy app process to get integrated into the whole thing and you're not going to have to know like you do with
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.120]   The amazon with the echo with a lexa
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.560]   Um, what's there in order to ask for it?
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:02.800]   It'll just be part of one big system there and the third parties will be you know, woven into one
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.760]   So picture picture, you know your iphone
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.400]   Uh, your your ios device with all the apps but no app screen
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:16.320]   It just knows which app to get called on that's the that's the ideal isn't and that's what google and apple both want to do
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.120]   Michael, but will viv require samsung
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.160]   Um, what pardon
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.800]   Uh, viv is going to require samsung hardware though. Of course, it's going to be a samsung
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.120]   specific thing
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.920]   Well, if i remember right from your article steven samsung is using it but they're leaving viv
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:39.200]   As its own division right so they will be able to market it to other companies
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.040]   Yeah, but they're not they didn't buy it to give it to the world
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:48.560]   They bought it because you know, they're at a disadvantage because in order to have this
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:52.320]   This thing you really have to own the hardware there right and yeah
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.280]   To build it into the the hardware
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.760]   um, so google and
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.120]   Apple have the advantage if they could build their assistant in
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:07.600]   Microsoft has cortana, but they don't have a phone so cortana is never going to be part of our lives to a really deep degree
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.840]   Uh, well, even if there's no
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.880]   Yeah, and even if viv is open to a
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:18.240]   Same reason facebook it couldn't work with its facebook home because they didn't own a phone
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.120]   Right and even if viv is open up to other hardware
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:29.520]   Google's not going to make viv the allow you to give the default neither is and apple certainly isn't going to allow ios to make viv the default
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.000]   But the samsung android phones can do it
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:39.200]   Yeah, I was so excited that I wouldn't have to buy any more samsung phones after the note seven disaster now you're telling me i'm gonna
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.320]   Be back in the market. They did say they're going to do the note eight right they've or is that
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:47.440]   Yeah
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:50.880]   Yeah, the first command you learn will be viv don't catch fire, please
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:21:02.160]   Viv extinguish extinguish the galaxy s7's never had that problem. No, they didn't um and i'm still i would still be surprised if the note
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.160]   Name survived. I know that the uh
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.440]   Korean press release mentioned about the the reef and they were giving to korean users
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:16.640]   Basically to say hey half off a note eight if you had to turn in your notes, sadly, but I don't know i something tells me
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.000]   That that branding might not be able to recover especially with how much money they're continuing to have to lose
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.240]   You know all the mobile profits were wiped out um expectedly. I mean, you know the thing you make an exploding phone
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:35.280]   Yeah, things go back. Yeah, I mean honestly, but they were a smaller company and weren't already so successful and so good at other things
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:41.040]   Then this could have been the sort of thing that could have been the end for them. So um, I mean that's that's the upside
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.440]   Um, steven did you know like when you talked?
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.560]   I don't know if you've heard anything from the viv guys are know from sam's line
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.600]   Do they have any plans of integrating that with the the smart homes?
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:55.680]   They're not smart on the smart things stuff. Yeah, samsung also bought smart things didn't they because that would be interesting where you've got all these
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.680]   Internet of things stuff, you know with smart things and that has become a decent hub
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.880]   Having that and viv integration could be really really compelling
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.760]   No, I haven't spoke to them about that, but it certainly be reasonable to assume
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.800]   If sam's on knows what it's doing
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.880]   That those will be among the first things to be integrated into into the platform
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.880]   Right now you can actually use your echo to control your smart things hub
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.400]   Yeah, and that's that's to what you said steven that the openness of the amazon platform
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:27.920]   Right. Yeah, yeah, I actually I talked to the new seer of nest recently
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:34.080]   Um, and you know they they want to be on everything there. So, you know, uh, you see that
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.640]   They were they're on elixir
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.400]   So before they got on google home before google home was launched
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:43.920]   Uh, you know you could control your nest through elixir
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:50.080]   And he says this is part of the alphabet ethos now that you know doesn't have to be alphabet first google
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:54.960]   You know, we don't have to play with our partners or our cousins or brothers
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.320]   Whatever you want to call them of the other bets. They call them. You know, not
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.200]   subsidiaries
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.080]   They they can just go and succeed on you know
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.440]   With third parties as well as with the other bets
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.560]   But pity that any anyone on the amazon api though
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:14.880]   Pity the pork has daily tech headlines on there. Do you really and is it is it messy?
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:19.520]   No, it was easy. It was easy. Yeah, pity the I don't know that's fine
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:26.320]   But what about the pork consumer who is now in this tower of babble with multiple devices and multiple syntaxes
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:33.440]   It doesn't seem like a solution. I think you you you run the risk of such fragmentation that nothing wins
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:40.320]   So we tonight I'm listening to your headlines. What do I have to say to like say give these people like they have to work specifically?
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.920]   We're on the yes
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.760]   Yeah, so there's a couple of things we are you're asking tom go ahead and tell them
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.960]   Tell them tell them yeah, I'm for either one you say add in my case daily tech headlines add daily tech headlines to flash briefing
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.720]   That's it. Yeah
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:56.400]   Or add to it say her name first, but i'm trying not to try not to
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:01.360]   Hey echo try not to turn on say hey echo, although I set my echo to answer to echo so i'm
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.240]   Yeah, I think daily tech that much which is fine with me
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.040]   Twitter is also on in fact this show will probably be on the
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:12.080]   Flash briefing tomorrow morning parts of the show a small part of this show because we
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.560]   You really wouldn't want a two hour flash
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:19.920]   Well, yeah mine seven minutes and they're like well, we prefer five but okay sure yeah, they were sure
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.120]   Um, and as it should be really because you have multiple
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:27.760]   Sources on there and then i'm sure it's true for your show as well as ours
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.120]   You can use tune in to listen any of our twitch shows the podcast right?
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.000]   Um, but but again if you're a consumer
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.800]   Uh, it's bewildering and I I don't see any one
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.880]   Yes, we can say as as geeks. Oh, this one's better than that one
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:48.320]   But I don't see one head and so far head and shoulders above that we're going to avoid this fragmentation problem
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.400]   And I think I could kill the whole category
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.760]   Anything that's always been the challenge with this stuff right is is having to figure out how it all works together and
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.320]   Also, as you said
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:05.200]   Making sure people aren't afraid of even jumping in but I do think that's why products like google home and the echo are important
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.080]   I got my mom and echo from mother's day and she loves it. Yes
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:14.240]   They don't have they don't have smart home things in the house, but she can pull up audible and spotify exactly from her echo
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:21.680]   And so it's compelling and it's one of those things where maybe for christmas i'll get them some smart locks or get her a phillips use system or something
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.000]   Start slow. It's a witch precisely, but it is already now that's already part of her house
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.520]   She's used to talking to what she likes it and it's something that she can use
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:36.480]   We taught our us our in-laws in the seven in their 70s. They only need one command echo play elvis
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:42.560]   And that's and they're happy. They're happy. That's all and it's and they're amazed by the way
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:51.680]   Does a google home speaker sound better? Steven the echo speaker's a little disappointing, but supposedly the google home speaker is is better
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.040]   Well, you you're one thing I was was going to do today. I never got around to it. Of course
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:05.040]   Uh was that used the you know the google audio device. What's it called? Um chrome audio from the get the croncast audio
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:11.120]   Yeah, but yeah to attach that to my speakers. So, oh, then you could command your speakers from the home
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:16.640]   Right. I have a man. So I have an echo dot is connected with to a bluetooth speaker
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.960]   I do the same and with this you could do you know the same thing with the home so you can make it sound good
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.040]   And early next year have you tried this yet, Christina?
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.920]   Sonos integration is coming for the yes, I got to see a preview of that a few weeks ago
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.800]   That's awesome. And I think that's a match made in heaven
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:40.240]   Because I have a sonos system I also have an echo and I have an echo dot and to be able to control that is fantastic
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.840]   And that's a niche audience for sure
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:46.800]   But I think that is the perfect sort of niche thing that can expand this sort of thing and you can kind of create
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.200]   I mean being able to talk to your sonos
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:56.640]   Why not by wouldn't you want to so uh, we watched the demo of course when when google, uh announced it or am uh amazon
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:00.160]   I'm sorry. I'm sono. I mean, whoever you see the problem
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:02.800]   You see the problem here
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.640]   When when amazon, I guess it was announced it. Um, it wasn't clear
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.200]   Uh, what kinds of commands you could give can I say to my echo?
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:16.400]   I want to listen to elvis in the living room
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.400]   Yes
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.480]   Yeah, and can I do I have access to all my sonos subscriptions
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:26.480]   From the echo can I say on spotify on tune in?
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.040]   I'm pretty sure yes, but you might have to say on my sonos
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:37.120]   I'm not 1000 pause about that the the demo I had was didn't go that in depth and it won't be in beta until I think the end of the
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.200]   Year and it'll be out early next year
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.880]   Uh, but I believe that that's that's the plan is to be able to have
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:48.320]   Close to the full range of a functionality to be able to control your sonos with your voice from your echo
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.400]   Which is fantastic
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:57.920]   And and yet I think this is all still very bewildering. It says bat, you know, and home automation never took off for exactly the same problem
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.480]   Fragmentation
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:07.280]   complicated a lot of it's a lot easier now home automation did not have a voice other recognition and understanding that we have now
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:14.080]   So I think you know one one thing now we're taking for granted already is how well
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.680]   uh
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.160]   These companies have done in pushing
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.560]   voice recognition and language understanding and it's going to get better
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.040]   Uh, you know after after the google event. I went to google looking for an angle
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:30.400]   No one else might have had and I talked to one of their top
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.680]   uh
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:38.640]   Scientists in voice understanding there and he was super excited because he felt that they're going to get
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:45.520]   Data about how people talk and ask computers and systems like this to do things that they've never had before
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:51.520]   He actually calls this period of the next two years the transition because he feels they're going to get enough data to
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:57.520]   Have a tipping point and how well google can understand the way people talk when they ask for things there
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.080]   So he's super excited that this thing in the home is actually sort of a trojan horse that
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.080]   Gathered data not personal data
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:12.240]   But aggregate data about how people ask for things and they'll be able to use their neural nets and deep learning systems to improve the way they understand language
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:17.200]   That's how google operates. That's what they did with goog411. It was really exactly to gain data
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:23.120]   Is google not best positioned to do this? I can amazon do something similar. No, I think not
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:30.000]   No, well, no one touches google when it comes to this AI stuff and they've got deep mind over there in london, you know
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.120]   Uh doing amazing things they came over the paper last week
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.240]   I uh
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:39.840]   About how they were using their deep learning systems to create cryptography systems, right?
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.400]   So it's sort of amazing they've created a
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:45.440]   Script a crypto system
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.640]   By these neural nets, but no one knows how it works. Wow
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:56.720]   Yeah, it's a little scary. Yeah, that's just a bad. That's a bad trend. They had allis bob and eve ai
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.400]   ai's
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.400]   And and they tasked each one of them
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.840]   With going af like allis and bob had to talk to each other
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.080]   But they weren't given an encryption scheme and eve had to try to intercept the message and decrypt it
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:12.800]   And that's all they did allis and bob were able to talk. Oh, you couldn't break in
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:18.880]   Oh, and they don't know what the encryption was it's begun. That is that is actually terrifying
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.720]   That's they're starting to talk to each other and we have no idea how
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:26.000]   They're not only starting to talk to each other, but they're encrypting it so we can't
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.840]   We can't hear it and then we have no idea what they're doing this
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.640]   That is the most important story of the week
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.600]   And I of course I asked google
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:40.800]   Let me talk to these guys and they said we're not making them available. Yeah, no kidding. They're not actually people
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.440]   It's bob
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:47.120]   Let's take a break. I'm now I am literally terrified
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:50.080]   That is the worst news of all
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:55.680]   Well, you know that's to me that's the singularity
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:59.680]   The singularities was when machines can design themselves, right?
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:05.200]   Because then it accelerates it if paced that far faster than a human can keep up with that's this is the beginning
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:12.160]   Machines designing their own encryption protocol and even they can't understand what happens no human can understand that's terrifying
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.800]   And i'm not joking. All right, we're gonna take a break
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.440]   Uh, maybe i'm joking a little
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:23.600]   Uh, we got a great panel lots more to talk about but I have to get everybody out of here before the eagles hit the field so
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.200]   Let's talk about texture if you like magazines who doesn't
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:33.040]   I I when when Stephen wrote for news week. That was a religious read every single week
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:39.680]   And there's still great writing happening and rolling stone and vanity fair and you know, nick bilton's moved to vanity fair
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.000]   You get that's where you read his amazing pieces
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.640]   But who wants to buy dead trees or some worse?
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:52.720]   Subscribed to dead trees. I mean how how silly is that the idea that you give somebody some money and every
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:57.600]   Month they're gonna kill a bunch of trees and send them to your house with stuff on it
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:06.080]   Why do that when you could get texture texture is like netflix for magazines 200 plus magazines for one low monthly rate
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:10.800]   Everything you want. I mean people us entertainment weekly
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:16.080]   Cosmopolitan see i don't i'm not gonna subscribe to cosmo that would be embarrassing
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:19.840]   But i do like to take the sex quiz every month and so now i can
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:25.520]   Rolling stone there's always one great article in rolling stone every month i want to read and i don't have to subscribe anymore
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:31.680]   Sports illustrated national geographic, you know when you're looking at it on your ipad or your android device or your phone
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:36.080]   And you're looking at these great photo essays in national geographic they come to life
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:41.920]   Uh on your ipad and they're beautiful much better than some screened print in a magazine
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:45.280]   Even more they can give you video there's features they can add
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:49.120]   Over and above what they could put in the magazine audio and video extras
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:53.840]   Plus you get every single page in the current new stand edition and back editions
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.680]   You can share it
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:00.800]   I love this lisa has our texture subscription, but you can put it on up to five devices
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:08.240]   So i can i can put it on my ipad she can put it on her ipad. We can read our magazines in peace i read sports illustrated she reads the atlantic
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.200]   It works out great. I want you to try it free
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:16.400]   immediate access to all the top magazines back issues bonus video content everything

[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:46.160]   We just got we flew to Gainesville for a day yesterday and our friday and texture was a great
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   Lifesaver i get on a plane. I love having that texture out there you download them and they're all there
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.560]   uh, let's see
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:58.080]   I don't know where to go here
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.480]   I
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.040]   Still stunned by this cryptographic story
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.520]   How about facebook let's advertisers exclude users
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:10.880]   by race
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.360]   Pro publica
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.360]   uh was able to place an ad
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.640]   on facebook
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:25.440]   And among the choices the demographics exclude people who match at least one of the following african-american-american ispanic
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:28.000]   Is that racist or is that just algorithms?
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.760]   Nobody wants to touch it. Well according to some of the people
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:38.560]   Um, the pro publica spoke to it seemed like it might violate certain
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:43.120]   um, uh, laws because you know, uh,
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:48.960]   There there are certain things other that say you can't like the fair housing act of 1968. Yeah, that's the one. Thank you. Thank you
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:54.800]   Don, um, so that's interesting. It's also interesting that you can exclude all these other races, but you can't exclude
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.360]   Caucasian
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.120]   Um, uh people which is that's racist right there, isn't it?
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.240]   Yeah, well, I mean, I would think if you're really trying to target a specific demographic
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.640]   If that's what they're trying to give you if that's the argument for this sort of thing if you're trying to say I want to
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:13.920]   Target target facebook says we prohibit advertisers from using those options for discrimination
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.960]   Right because they can really tell they can really tell
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.600]   They're doing a bane job of that
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:25.680]   If what they're saying is if we see an ad for housing that excludes african-americans, we will
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:33.920]   Kill that it's it's an interesting question because yeah, the civil rights act for instance says you can't print or publish notices or advertisements
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.360]   Indicating a preference based on race, but that's not what's happening in this ad
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.560]   You mean obviously if you put in the ad, you know, only whites can apply that would be illegal, but
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.840]   I imagine in 1964 they didn't really contemplate an advertising system that would allow you to
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:56.240]   Select which races would see the right but I mean and there is and I guess there is something to be said about the fact that
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:03.600]   Free very frequently you have different commercials or cuts movie trailers or cuts are cut differently depending on what demographic and what type of
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.240]   You know what type of people they think are going to see those things and and that's an that's a common
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.400]   Advertising trick and there's nothing wrong. I don't think with
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:19.280]   Trying to market to a specific type of audience. I think that the the big question is are you doing that by excluding or in some way
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:24.400]   I'm holding back other audiences. Uh, so I don't know. I think it's it's interesting. It's certainly
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:30.480]   With all the other kind of issues the facebook is faced with you know questions of bias
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.520]   It's certainly not a great look
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:38.640]   the pro publica got went to the new york times and said you know the new york times has
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:45.040]   You know policies in place that prohibit this but then they said we also reject ads that contain too many white people
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.040]   so
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:47.840]   I
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:55.200]   Well and the the other interesting thing about facebook is what they're doing is ethnic affinity because you don't right state your ethnicity on facebook
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.240]   What's your affinity?
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.200]   Do seeing it? Yeah, no they're deducing it from what you do
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.760]   They're saying our algorithm notices that you like these kinds of things you talk to these
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.160]   So it isn't really about your race. It's about and so we're making a guess that you are
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:11.040]   An african-american or that you are hispanic, right?
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.960]   Well, I know how well that worked because facebook's thinks i'm a republican so
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.240]   Because remember you could see what facebook thought you were
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:23.040]   Right. They got my i think you i think you still do that. You know, I mean clearly
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.680]   uh, this is something that
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.960]   as
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:33.280]   The history of facebook, uh, they're going to roll it back. You know, they're going to say, oh, no, sorry. Yeah
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.600]   Yeah, and apparently
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.880]   They
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:43.120]   They're looking and saying like the it's not being used in discriminatory sense. They they they check it out
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.560]   but um, you know, look facebook is an advertising
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:51.520]   company there, um, and if there's always things
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:56.560]   Because it deals in such huge amounts of numbers there
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:03.360]   And micro targeting is the advantage of their advertising system there is um, any i can
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:09.440]   I'm sure you can see how this slipped through there, but um, uh, it looks bad when you see it on the screen
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.760]   Kenneth when you're i know people work in the ad agency and this is not unusual
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.400]   To say i want to place an ad campaign. Sure. I want to hit hispanics
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:24.320]   But i don't want to hit african-american audiences go by the ad campaign the difference is you don't have a drop down menu to do it
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:31.360]   You have to call them together right networks and so seeing a drop down menu that says exclude african-americans
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, it causes an emotional reaction
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:40.960]   Yeah, it's best the bad is the bad optics of what of translating, you know, uh in a friction-free way
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:45.360]   What advertisers, you know an agency has done for quite some time
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:51.360]   Kenneth lip writing for the daily beast at and t is spying on americans for profit
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:58.800]   Hey, this is exciting the uh atent apparently we've known for a while that phone companies have portals for law enforcement and allasum
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:02.160]   Uh to do, uh, what are they called pen register?
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:04.640]   uh pen warrant
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:09.440]   um requests that are not that do or warrantless requests that things like location
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:12.240]   Uh metadata and so forth
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.320]   Uh, but hemisphere is a product that atent developed
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.400]   marketed
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.920]   and sells
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.280]   At a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:26.560]   to access the company's treasure trove of data
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:31.840]   And these are uh documents that the daily beast has uncovered this was of course
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:36.320]   timely because atnt is uh trying to buy time one or for 85
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.880]   billion dollars the real question is
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:46.160]   How much of the data massaging does atnt do does it merely offer a gps coordinates and meta data?
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.760]   Or is it actually taking all the data?
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:53.600]   It hasn't has much more data and massaging it putting it together in a way that makes it more valuable to law enforcement
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.840]   And it well it requires a subpoena, right? That's that's all
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:04.800]   Right. Does it even require that? Yeah, I think it does. Okay. I thought you could just log in and
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.760]   So it requires a pina, but it doesn't require a warrant like a bicycle right?
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.720]   A war or a bicycle right uh hearing so that's
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:18.400]   ATTs have been doing this for ages of course that we remember the whistleblower 15 years ago that was
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.240]   Told us that the nsa had a special tap in the atnt
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.760]   Internet
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.800]   I love though, and I think this is if there's a smoking gun. It's the uh
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.520]   The document that atnt requires law enforcement client sign
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:36.880]   Which says if there's any way you can avoid revealing how you got this information
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:43.280]   We sure appreciated the government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or proceedings unless there's no
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:49.360]   Other available and emissive probative evidence in other words. Can we keep this a secret just between us?
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.600]   No referrals. There's no referral
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:58.160]   Please don't let us know that we were the ones because it might look bad for our customers between us. You might not appreciate this
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.480]   Yeah, so it's not illegal, but maybe our customers wouldn't be too happy about
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.760]   uh
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:12.240]   Actually then the the the follow up on this at least 17 firms according to bloomberg
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.040]   uh our marketing uh
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:21.760]   This kind of information to intelligence agencies include our twitter shares rising today after the company's let me pause this lovely
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:29.360]   Instant play video. Thank you bloomberg bloomberg really can't wait to get on the twitter timeline can they they just they're just so excited
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:35.920]   Well, and this is the twitter fire hose, which is right? I think this is a little different than what atnt's doing atnt's taking customer data
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:40.000]   That it owns and selling it based on a subpoena. This is a public
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:45.040]   Twitter right and saying we're gonna break it down and make it easy for you to surveil right
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:51.360]   It's still bad optics is a great word steven i'll get it's still bad optics
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:58.960]   Um, well the other hand, I don't know if this was the week before maybe discussed it last week, but the fcc decision
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:01.520]   The or f yeah, it was fcc
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:09.120]   Basically saying that the company's the isp's can't you know, uh, you know collect your private information
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:12.800]   uh, you know can without your permission, you know can
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.160]   Is a huge of dance for consumers? So that was actually a pretty positive thing
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:27.680]   For privacy that happened. This is information about websites you visit which isp's obviously have complete details on your mobile location information how you use apps
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.240]   all of this
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:37.120]   Now requires explicit consent from subscribers before verizon comcasts or atnt those people can sell your data
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:41.840]   Now this is to marketers obviously law enforcement has complete and full access to this event
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:48.240]   Right, I know but but I mean, you know, we're being surveilled, you know pretty thoroughly right by little brother
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:54.320]   And you know can no one had has better access than the isp's right, uh, you know, so
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.120]   It is you know
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:05.200]   It's a way not to be surveilled by the the people and people have much choice about which isp generally uh, they use so
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:11.600]   They have no choice to have someone watching every website you visit and then marketing that information
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:14.080]   Um now they can't do that
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:21.440]   That's just one of a number of pretty consumer friendly things this current commissioner has done a lot of people
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.000]   Myself included were pretty skeptical. Yes when you know wheeler, you know, who was a lobbyist
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.600]   I've been a lobbyist for the cable company became the head of the FCC
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:35.600]   Uh, we thought what is this and you know, what is this guy going to do and he actually turned out to be pretty good for consumers?
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.960]   He was the guy who fought for net neutrality and to actually make the internet
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:47.840]   Uh come under regulatory status, uh, which a lot of people, you know, uh on the other side felt shouldn't happen
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.440]   I still keep wondering what his angle is. I am sorry
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:58.000]   But I just what are you up to wheeler? You got it. He's got a sweet position with consumer reports lined up
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:05.600]   There's guy and of course this is the guy that uh, uh, was it uh, uh, it was john all of her famously
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:11.680]   Compared to a you know giving your baby to a dingo, uh, and well the dingo actually turned out to be pretty good now
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.920]   Yeah, it's a good nanny. That's so bad. I what's his angle. He's got to be up to something
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:22.560]   Uh, att speaking of which will now be able to not only monitor your phone calls, but uh, what tv shows you watch they have
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:29.680]   They have announced a new streaming tv service, uh direct tv now. This is all tied into the uh,
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.040]   I mean this time marner acquisition and now this
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:38.480]   Uh, we don't know when there was a rumor that will be november 4th in just a few days
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:43.040]   Uh, 35 for 100 channels is clearly a lost leader for
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.520]   At and t
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:49.280]   Um, why why do an over the top service?
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.080]   For 35 bucks for 100 channels
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:59.760]   When uh, sling charges 20 bucks for 25 channels place sony's charges 55 bucks for 100 channels
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.800]   This is this is a uh, a grab of some kind. What is
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.200]   Yeah, what is a qt up to christina?
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:11.760]   Uh, well, I mean I think that what it what they're up to is that they see that the future is going to be in these um bundles
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:18.640]   And whether is these these skinny bundles or or cord cutting or whatever you want to call it that the future of their customer race is not
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:20.720]   Going to be coming to them through cable subscriptions
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:26.160]   They're going to be coming to them through kind of these over the top subscriptions and the faster that they can get people to convert and the faster
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:31.440]   They can get people on board the better and if that means starting now with a lost leader
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.440]   Until they can get better care rates and better agreements to make the pricing work
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:41.360]   Um the better and I you know there was an interview with the um, I think it was with rennell stevenson
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:45.040]   I think that he gave to de bloomberg or no not a glooper. He was at the golden sachs conference
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:46.880]   Uh a couple of weeks ago
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.720]   I guess it was last month and he made some sort of statement about how they anticipate that
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:55.200]   Most of their business will be based on you know pure internet only plans
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:01.360]   Um by 2020 and this is how you get there by undercutting everybody else by offering good
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.000]   Good bundles tom and I were talking before the show started
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.680]   The big question is what networks are actually and what channels are actually going to be part of this
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:13.840]   But it certainly looks really compelling to come out of the gate and say we have a hundred plus channels for 35 dollars a month
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:19.760]   That becomes very very compelling in a world where people are just are many people have already cut the court
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:24.480]   But even even more people are considering it and if you're considering doing that why wouldn't you?
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:30.320]   Look at somebody like like direct tv at and t and make that move that that way tom of course
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.400]   You do a court cutters show court killers and you have a great guide to court cutting
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.280]   Uh that you've published is like mini book
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.920]   Uh and I keep having to update because they keep launching services like this. Well, that's what's interesting
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:46.080]   I mean, it's a clearly disruptive period and it's frustrating
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:52.400]   I mean, but isn't the big issue for court cutters getting live locals? Isn't that the one thing at this point?
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:53.600]   You can't do
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.480]   Yeah, and that's what's interesting with what direct tv is doing here because
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:03.040]   What a lot of people don't realize is if you were a satellite subscriber, you got almost all of this service already
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:08.080]   Uh, you could watch when I was a direct tv subscriber. I was always impressed by the number of channels
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:11.040]   I could watch live on my tablet
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:17.360]   Uh, just I wouldn't even really need the satellite if I didn't if I if I didn't want to watch it on my television
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:21.440]   And so what this is going to do is say, you know what? We didn't have to sync a lot into infrastructure
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:25.280]   We already had permission to do this so we can move this over
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:30.000]   We can we can make less than a dollar per subscriber on it because we're trying to build market share
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.600]   And we've got deals with the networks for local channels
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:37.120]   Which is something that sling is still slowly building out
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:41.280]   PlayStation still slowly building out and could be a big advantage for direct tv. Yeah
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:46.080]   PlayStation does have live locals in some in some markets exactly
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.720]   It's linked us too. It just depends uh and sling obviously their big benefit
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:53.920]   Was that they were able to get things from from the dish deals and from some of those settlements?
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.520]   They were able to bring things over so you know direct tv has that advantage to where attainty does through direct tv
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.560]   but
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:06.320]   I'm looking forward to seeing how this launches because I do think that there are a lot of people out there who are very much wanting to cut their cable
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.520]   subscription
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:12.560]   Or are looking if they already have cut it or saying I want access to more channels
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.560]   But I don't want to subscribe to a million different things
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:21.760]   This as I said, I think this could be compelling depending on how it's done and and what the offering is
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:26.560]   All right, I know you have a couple of um, you know like cbs has its own
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:30.320]   Uh, app app now you see get that over the top there
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:36.480]   You know, eventually there's going to become a point where these local channels are going to realize
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:39.920]   That it's in their interest to get on these services there
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.760]   Absolutely now they they feel like they've got the power that they could force
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:49.520]   Uh, the cable companies to pay them, but if they're going to lose a lot of viewers
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:54.880]   Uh, you know locally who say well, I'm going to go over the top. I'll look at cbs.com
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:59.040]   I'll maybe have something else and I'll just never watch a bc my abc channel
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:04.880]   I don't want to spend the next $1 for that. I don't like their shows too much there. Um, you know, I kind of don't care about
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:09.600]   You know, they don't abc doesn't really have you know, uh, the sports. I wonder whatever
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:17.200]   Um, well in that case, uh, those same local stations might come begging to be on some of these services
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:24.480]   Did Comcast uh roll out its terra bite, uh caps because they're worried about over the top
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:27.440]   They have after all, uh, uh
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:30.320]   They sell premium tv services
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:33.840]   Yeah, I mean, a synix of take I think would take would say that that's true
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:39.760]   And I think that's probably part of it, especially since they've I think said to xfinity customers that if you subscribe to xfinity
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.080]   And you are watching xfinity video
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:47.040]   That doesn't count right you can stream you can stream over it. Yeah, so as you can stream over it now
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.720]   Or cap as
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:52.560]   Precisely so and that they were doing that a while back even before they institute the cap
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:56.000]   I mean, I think a synix would say that's absolutely true. I think there's probably part of it
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.920]   and
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:02.720]   But at the same time, I mean, I'd be very surprised if Comcast doesn't at some point come out with their own
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.600]   Skinny bundle of sorts. It's just it's a matter of time
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:10.720]   I think and they have one they have one available that's over the top. It's it's in a few amount of markets
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.720]   But yeah, it's probably gonna go more widespread
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.880]   That's why me. I mean nationwide. Yeah, yeah
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:19.760]   Clearly we need tom wheeler super hero to leap into action here
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.720]   And fix this mess we're gonna
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:26.720]   We need competition if the if Comcast didn't have cable television
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:30.240]   They'd still be putting in a terra bite cap and still be charging you 50
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:34.560]   For unlimited because they know you don't can't go anywhere else. Yeah, there's nowhere else to go
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:40.000]   Yeah, no terra bite is gonna either come down or people will be streaming higher definition television
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.800]   And that won't be as great as it sounds. No, I clean, you know, they started at 250 gigabytes
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.000]   They tried that out they went up to a terra bite, but I think they see
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.640]   That this is this is a cap that's gonna be important in a year two years three years
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:57.040]   Uh with uhd 4k and all this high res stuff coming down the pipe
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:00.560]   Uh, we I want to take a break because I don't want to be sensitive to your out time
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:04.720]   uh tom and we have one more commercial and I have a couple more terrifying stories
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:09.280]   Including the delivery of 50,000 beers by autonomous truck
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:13.680]   But first word as long as we're talking about highways about automatic
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:18.720]   We've talked so much about the automatic. This is a great device that plugs right into your obd 2 port in your car
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:23.120]   Every car since 1996 has had that little diagnostic port right below your steering wheel
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:26.320]   Maybe you even never noticed it or if you did you thought oh, that's not for me
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.240]   That's for the tech
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:34.080]   The guy working at the dealership. No, that's for you. This pairs to your smartphone. You plug it right into it
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:39.680]   It's powered by the obd 2 port and now you know more about what's going on in your car
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:44.960]   Then even that tech does here's is is even better. They've just introduced the automatic light
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:51.840]   Which is their most affordable adapter yet perfect if you've got a business fleet it tracks every trip
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:58.080]   Gas expenses one tap integrations and logging you get the engine light. You'll know what it means
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:04.960]   In fact, what's great? It says I here's the engine light. Here's what it is. And here's a mechanic nearby. I love it
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:08.080]   automatic calm
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.400]   They've got of course still got the automatic pro
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:15.120]   Which gives you 3g connection and that's subscription and fee free
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.600]   You can get human help with the pro in a crash
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:22.400]   Detect severe accidents trained responders will call for help even if you can't
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:26.640]   It's great if you've got teenagers you can have geo fencing. You'll know where your car is parked
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.240]   You'll know where your teenagers are going
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:30.800]   And it works with if this then that
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:31.440]   and
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:38.800]   Expensifying concur and a bunch of apps you can even link your car with the automatic to a nest thermostat or an amazon echo
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:42.400]   And you could say hey echo where did I park my car or hey echo?
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:46.400]   How much gas is left in the tank before you go out to get in the car?
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.160]   automatic now the automatic pro and

[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:18.400]   Uh out to ever note automatically and I would have a map. I'd have how much gas I use how much it cost

[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:50.080]   auto
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:56.080]   Uber's truck driving autonomous vehicles made their first delivery
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:03.120]   Wired magazine. Alex stavies had the story end of video and here's the truly terrifying thing in the video
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:07.040]   an 18 wheeler going down the highway
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:09.760]   at 55 miles an hour
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:14.800]   And there's nobody in the cab the guys in the back doing yoga
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.960]   That is that is not what I want to see going down the highway
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:22.720]   They say it's it's you know the driver will take it
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:25.760]   They took the beers in Fort Collins, Colorado
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:31.680]   Got the got the truck drove the truck to the uh on ramp got on the freeway and then engaged auto
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:38.800]   I think the guy should be forced to sit there though. He got in the back look at that's not right
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:41.920]   It's not even legal is it
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.200]   I from what I I've heard he was surrounded by state troopers escort again
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:53.040]   It was that it was at a low period of traffic
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:58.560]   Okay, even though that that video makes it look like there are a bunch of other people on the road 120 miles
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:01.920]   Uh drove to Colorado Springs with 50,000 cans of beer
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:03.920]   Uh
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:06.640]   Again again again. It's the it's the optics there really
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:08.160]   um
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:14.720]   You know google is pursuing you know, can these guys came from google the level four degree of autonomy
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.520]   Which means the thing does it by itself there?
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:23.200]   So on the highway they're confident that could happen and it would be silly to have him sitting there
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:27.040]   Because you know the what google has learned all he'll do is screw it up
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.720]   On the highway is if the car needs you generally, uh, it's too late
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:36.480]   Yeah, you know you can't this wasn't your mind because you'll be sitting there. You're not paying attention
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:39.920]   Even if you got you yeah, exactly. Yeah, and then saying you know by the way
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:42.880]   You know the car ahead of you just like hit the brakes or something like that
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:46.240]   You know or like someone who is riding a bicycle in the highway
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.400]   You know they're just veered in front of you. It's it's too late to do anything about that
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.360]   I got a new way
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:55.680]   So you need you need to have the truck handle anything that could happen on the highway, right?
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:01.760]   And then you know, it doesn't matter whether the whether the drivers in the back were you know, or sleeping or whatever
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.800]   Three lives aren't the first run it made either. Oh, really? This was the first run with budweiser in it
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.800]   They did a bunch of times
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:11.440]   This they did a bunch of empty
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:17.440]   Because now they're risking the sign off on it. Yeah, well, but well, but well, yes risking real products
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:23.200]   Three lydar units on the cab and the trailer a radar on the bolt
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:26.240]   Bolted to the bumper and a high precision camera on the windshield
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.960]   Somewhat similar
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:33.440]   Pay for this is just like a product placement. Oh, sure. Well, they mentioned the button
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:35.440]   Safe button on the truck
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:38.800]   They went to anhyzer bushen and I guess anhyzer busch came to them
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:42.240]   According to one of the stories I read and said we'd like to be involved somehow. Okay
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:49.040]   What I thought was interesting and I did not know this I was worried about all the truck drivers who are about to lose their jobs apparently
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:51.120]   That's not the problem. There's far more
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.400]   Far more jobs than there are people to drive
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:57:00.400]   And they can't they the demand is there's a shortfall of 48,000 drivers
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:06.560]   This year and it could hit 175,000 by 2024. So maybe we do need auto
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:09.520]   If you think about it, this is going to drive down
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:14.160]   The cost of these trucking companies goes with the trucks will be able to go
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.240]   You know, it makes me sad. So there's going to be more trucks
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:21.120]   They'll be cheaper than rail now
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:23.280]   We had this thing called trains
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:27.600]   They were on rails. You didn't have to steer them
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:29.040]   We still have them
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:32.880]   You only went forward and backward that would be a perfect autonomous thing in fact
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:36.800]   I know many trains are autonomous every time I you know get on
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:39.680]   The subway and where is it Seattle? There's nobody driving
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:43.600]   Um the mono rail in Las Vegas. There's nobody driving
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:50.480]   But we abandoned our rail system for trucks and I guess game spot gave it seven out of ten because it was on rails
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:58.160]   By the way, this the new slogan for auto auto get blotto. No, that's not
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:00.640]   That's not that's not the slogan
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:06.320]   Uh, but anyway, there you go. That's I think in some ways that is a watershed moment to the autonomous
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.720]   truck driving 120
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:11.200]   Miles and finally I
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:16.880]   Red matt maulin wigs a posting mad of course the creator of wordpress. He's pissed
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:24.640]   Yeah, and I think rightly so. He said he was he sat down to use wicks, which is a proprietary web platform
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:29.920]   Uh the whip wicks mobile app and he said wait a minute. This is my code. This is our code
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:34.560]   Which was open source wicks used it apparently according to maulin wig
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:39.280]   uh in he says extreme contravention of the gpl
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:44.080]   and uh and uh he says i'll i'll take it as a compliment but
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:46.640]   You know to be great
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:51.440]   Use the abide by the gpl and release your source code back to the community and maybe give us a little credit
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:56.080]   Uh the ceo of wicks posted a response on the wicks blog
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:03.040]   And said we're we're well. Let's get rid of the ad. We're very surprised by your post as you have so many claims against us
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:06.480]   Wow, dude. I did not even know we were fighting
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:12.160]   Okay, I thought we did on a high note
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:17.520]   Dude dude. I didn't even know i gpl some other stuff. Come on
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:21.440]   Did you not see I force the code and and get help?
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.840]   GitHub did
