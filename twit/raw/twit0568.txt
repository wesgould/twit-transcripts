[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   What an amazing show ahead for you.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.480]   Jason Calicanas joins me along with Ian Thompson.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.240]   Of course, because Ian's here, we're going to have to start by talking a little bit about Brexit
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.080]   and what it means to the tech community and the community at large.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.000]   And I have a feeling we're going to get pretty, pretty heavy on this one.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.840]   So stay tuned.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.680]   Apple drops the headphone port.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.760]   Is that a big deal?
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.760]   Maybe so.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.320]   In fact, maybe the end of Apple, according to some, and we'll talk about Solar City and
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.080]   Elon Musk and his plan to make the next trillion dollar company.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.320]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.320]   On Twit.

[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.320]   This week in Tech the show where we cover the great Tech News of the Week with smart,
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   intelligent tech journalists.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.320]   Or sometimes people who are just like in the middle of it like Mr. Jason Calicanis who
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   lives Tech.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   He's Tech as an angel investor.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   Is that what I should call you an angel investor?
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.320]   Early stage investor.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   I started obviously my career as a journalist.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   Now I do angel investing but I still run companies too.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   So I have three hats I wear.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   Once a journalist always kind of you always have that bent that interest in looking at things
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   in a unique way.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   You know asking questions and having that BS meter is in your head.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   It's in your head.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.320]   It's in your head.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   You're constantly when you're talking to people trying to form the next question.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   Which is actually why so many journalists wind up becoming investors.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   Because it really is about asking questions, listening, being present and then coming up
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   with a follow up question.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320]   And of course deal flow.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.320]   Deal flow is good.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   So if you're a MG Seagler or Omallik they knew everybody from being a journalist.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   It's a great way to cut your teeth and then you leverage that into an investing career.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   And meanwhile Ian and I will just sit here in the corner with the whole of our stocks.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320]   Rubbing our headies together.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.320]   Ian Thompson also here from the Register that code.uk.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.320]   And was just coincidentally and is Scottish by.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.320]   But half Scott.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.320]   My father's side of the family is Scott.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   Where did you grow up though?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   I grew up in Derbyshire in the in the Peak District.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.320]   Okay.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   And I'm a little village in New England.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   That's in England.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   Yes.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   Very Tlee place.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   So when you came in you said I only got a few hours sleep on the night of the Brexit vote.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.320]   I just I started listening about lunchtime UK time because of the time difference.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.320]   And yeah it was about 5am before it was just like I've got to be doing interview in about
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   three hours time.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320]   I need to get some sleep.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   But it was you couldn't.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   To be honest my wife learnt an awful lot of English swear words.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.320]   She probably shouldn't have been introduced to it at that point.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.320]   But yeah it was it was a very fraught night.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   The last few days haven't been much better.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.320]   I'd like to keep it light and cheery.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   But basically the UK is screwed.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   So there you go.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   There you have it.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.040]   I mean there's all look it's funny from our point of view across the pond.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.320]   I don't think we really know what to think of it right.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.120]   On the one hand I understand how voters might be afraid of untrammeled immigration.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.320]   The UK is one of the richest of the UK of the EU countries or UK is even a country.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   Well technically yeah I guess it was alright.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.920]   It was a richest and so as a result it carries the weight of Greece and other countries that
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.920]   are suffering.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.200]   It also you're going to get your share of immigrants coming in who are looking for work
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.960]   in one of the richer countries just as Germany does.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.000]   So I understand the reluctance to keep your borders wide open.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.200]   I also understand the reluctance to let Brussels decide things that would normally be to be
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.760]   decide by parliament.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   Oh certainly.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.400]   I mean there are strong elements and my family is split.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.320]   Largely 50/50 between voting remains.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.600]   This was by the way we should point out the country it was only a few percentage points.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   It was 3.2 to 48.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   52 to 48.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   Yes.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.640]   Although if you look at demographics it was the over 45 set that voted 4 eggs in the EU.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.720]   Over 50s were overwhelmingly vote leave.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.440]   And the young people did not want to leave.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.080]   No why not.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.200]   Well because they want the right to live and work in 29 other countries should they have
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.400]   the desire to.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.000]   They recognise that Europe has kept the peace for the last 70 years which is longer than
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.640]   the conscience managed for the last 2000.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.760]   By the way that is at least from my point of view the one thing that here in the states
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.160]   we might look across the pond and worry about because one of the things the source of two
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   world wars now.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.720]   Yeah and Putin is getting frisky in the sidelines and the head of NATO could be coming from
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.280]   the US as the best ever president when it comes to running the.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.240]   So a united Europe to us looks better for peace.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.240]   Absolutely.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.080]   So if you technology there's economic benefit to negotiating one treaty with 29 countries
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   than multiple treaties.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.880]   I mean we'll have to negotiate separately with England of course.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.080]   If you look at the demographics of just Europe as a whole and it's under a billion people
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.720]   and it's a very slow growth culture you have you know population growth is a fifth of other
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.560]   countries other continents.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   So people are getting old there what do people do when they get old you know they they want
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.560]   to protect what they have.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.680]   Oh that's the right thing I understand world.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.720]   And it's kind of the same reason Trump is supported.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   We want to go back to the days when England was England.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.040]   And England wasn't a bunch of curry shops on the corner we want to go back.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.400]   Okay on the curry front I would have to say.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.160]   It's pretty great curry.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.600]   You were talking about what immigrants give to this country before immigrants brought curry
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.040]   in the rest of it to this country we had scones and trust me that really boring.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   Bangers and bush.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   Yeah we had bangers and marshmallow had fish and chips.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.040]   We had roast, clearly I'm being put in.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.040]   It's going to be a disaster.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.560]   It's going to be a complete disaster in terms of economics because.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.760]   From pure economics I mean the biggest winners out of this are Ireland because if you're
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.640]   an international company that wants to get into the Eurozone your first choice if you're
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.000]   an English speaking country like the US was to come to the UK.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.120]   If the UK isn't in the Eurozone annual.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.600]   And by the way then they're going to Ireland.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   That includes Ireland.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   Or Berlin.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   Well Northern Ireland.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   Northern Ireland.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.160]   Northern Ireland has the very favourable tax systems.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   So that's where the very important is.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.080]   Yeah this is where they funnel all their money.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.280]   So this doesn't affect that.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.720]   No but I mean if you're actually looking to get along in you know.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.000]   Is Southern Ireland in the EU?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Yeah it is.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.280]   Oh they're firmly in the EU.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.440]   And in fact Northern Ireland could be going into the EU.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   Well that's the other thing.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.840]   They're now talking about a referendum to rejoin with Ireland to keep their EU status.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.320]   If you're nostalgic about Jolly Old England you might be a little nervous about the notion
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.080]   that Scotland is not thrilled about this.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080]   Scotland's going.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.080]   60+% to 38%
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.480]   Every single constituency in Scotland voted to stay.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   And of course Scotland had recently had an independence vote that failed.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.840]   Now they're thinking they will have another independence vote and they will appeal to
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.880]   they will apply to be in the EU.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880]   And they'll do it.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.880]   Which is kind of mind boggling.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.960]   Everything I'm seeing from the Scotland vote is if the EU membership is at stake the Scotland
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   independence vote will win.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.480]   And I think it's an enormous mistake for Scotland but at the same time they will win.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.520]   But speaking as a tech company I could now I could still go to Ireland.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.800]   I could still go to perhaps to Scotland.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   I like to go to England.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.280]   I might want to go to England.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.880]   But just think about data privacy.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.120]   Where are you going to store your data?
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.760]   Well let me build your product.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   Let me bring this up because you're a paid market.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.040]   It's like you're now going to have the reason the EU is so transformative I think for tech
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.800]   companies was we could look at that region as one region as opposed to building a terms
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.560]   of service for every region building a product for every region.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   And now it's going to be okay we have to build a product and an office in the UK and in the
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.920]   EU and in this country.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.760]   You're competing against South America and China, United States.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   It's going to set them back.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.520]   Of course they might make some better decisions for themselves.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.960]   We'll see how that turns out.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:15.120]   But it is something there is something in the air about not trusting the government,
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   not trusting politicians.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.120]   Yes well.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.120]   And we stay here with Trump obviously.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:24.920]   There is a much larger story and it's being told here to a complete distrust of what up
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   to now I'm in the elites.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.840]   Not just the political elites but the media elites.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   Intellectuals.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   The intellectual elites.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.680]   And so that's pretty clearly happening in the US.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.520]   I think that the Trump movement and to certain degree the Bernie Sanders movement are about
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.520]   same thing.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.320]   Turning their backs because as a media elite I guess I'm the one who's suffering here.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.120]   But turning your back on the elites I expected the pay to be a lot better.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   At least get a makeup person if it's going to be a media elite.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.400]   But you know what the thing is?
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.320]   I really think this comes down to jobs and the economy.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.640]   If the rich keep getting richer.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   It's incoming quality.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.760]   And people in the middle are looking and they're saying wow all these rich people are getting
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.480]   so rich and then the middle class is getting ground down and the poor don't feel there's
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480]   a path.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.640]   There's no path to get to the middle class and the middle class is stuck.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.960]   And if you look at something just one example education and college education.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.960]   Oh huge.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.240]   Used to be that you had this great path to success which was city universities and state
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.720]   universities were either free or cheap.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.600]   And now Bernie Sanders comes down and says hey let's make college free again.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600]   You know what?
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.120]   That's a brilliant idea.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.280]   It gives people a path to get out of poverty.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.480]   And you know what?
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.120]   The elite are like yeah we don't want to get free college.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.920]   As a member of the elite at this point in my life and being previously being poor.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.920]   Let's make college free again.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.760]   Let's give people a path because if people feel ground down they don't trust Hillary.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.240]   They don't trust intellectuals.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.680]   They don't trust global warming.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.000]   And they're going to vote for somebody like Trump who can't complete a sentence and
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.800]   have changes his plan every other week.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.480]   And I'll be honest I completely understand.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   I'm not unsympathetic to that.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.920]   He says a little bit like let Rome burn.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   It's a burn it down vote.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   It is.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.920]   It says exactly.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.080]   Glenn Greenwald and the intercept kind of surprised me and I'm not sure I completely agree
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.000]   with him but he says Brexit is only the latest proof of the insularity and failure of Western
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   established institutions.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.360]   This exactly what he's saying is the failure of the elite, the political elite, the media
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.520]   elite, the government elite to provide an opportunity.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.080]   And it's a reaction to that to people who feel disenfranchised.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.600]   No, no, I don't feel it.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.880]   And I completely understand that.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.200]   So now if you're Google you might not be completely against this.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.400]   Google's had horrific times with the EU in privacy, the right to be forgotten.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.440]   It doesn't necessarily, the EU is not necessarily a great place for American corporate interests.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.600]   Well, okay.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.400]   It's not a great place for American corporate interests who want to carry on the way that
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   they do in America.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.560]   But Microsoft's been censured by the EU.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.280]   Google has been censured by the EU.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.520]   But why were they censured?
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.160]   Microsoft was censured because the EU took action that the US government wasn't prepared
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   to do.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.360]   Yeah, but the EU did don't be things.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.560]   The EU said, well, your Internet Explorer browser is a monopoly.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.440]   Just as our Department of Justice tried to do in the 90s.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.200]   And then completely without.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.120]   And what they ended up doing is saying, well, what you got to do is browser ballot.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.400]   They insisted on a ballot.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   When you install Windows in Europe, you get, okay, which browser do you want to be the
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.400]   default?
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.880]   This was a terrible solution.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.880]   The cookie.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.200]   Yes.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.120]   Because it's not what it doesn't serve anybody in any way.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.280]   The cookie banner that you see everywhere now as you travel around the Internet is directly
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:37.440]   attributable to Brussels because of their privacy concerns misguided privacy concerns
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   about cookies.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.840]   Okay, we could argue long.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.720]   But how does it in any way do anything but annoy that banner?
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.480]   Do you just you click OK, right?
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.480]   It depends on the site.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.440]   I'll just check out that terms and conditions and then I decide whether or not I'm going
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.440]   to carry on that.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.960]   Everybody else just clicks OK and says get rid of that banner.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   It's just annoying.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.960]   It had the opportunity to make the decision.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.280]   The right to be forgotten is an abomination.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.640]   It's a misunderstanding about the Internet works.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.280]   It's an attempt to edit history and you think the Germans of all people would know better.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.720]   Now now the Germans of the nice nice boxes.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   Now that they're the nice people I know.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.680]   But I'm going to say it's sort of this week and going there.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.360]   There's a string on their people.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.360]   There's been no I'm not going there.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.360]   Look at there.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.360]   We're almost there.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   There's blood coming.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   Okay.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   Who's stringing up a little big enough?
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.960]   Bad decisions against US tech companies coming out of Brussels.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.960]   No, I'm not sure.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960]   I think I don't.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.480]   There is one good thing.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.920]   When you have to deal with one governing body as opposed to 20 or 30, it does make it for
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   the United States.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.920]   The US companies a little bit easier.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.000]   Google still has to go to France and deal with the French courts and Germany and deal
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.040]   with the German courts.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   So no, it's not.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.280]   It doesn't it doesn't it.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:53.960]   The EU's decisions do not eliminate the the courts in France and the courts in Germany.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.360]   They provide a crucial buffer zone between allowing companies to do exactly what the
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.980]   hell they want and actually holding their account on some level.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.440]   There is an anti corporate sentiment that comes out of Europe.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.320]   Europe is pro government anti corporate just as US is anti government.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.280]   You can't say the entire EU is pro is anti corporate.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.120]   It just doesn't work like that.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.280]   It feels like nine different nations.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.160]   At the end of the day, people get to choose which country they live in.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.840]   The United States happens to be full capitalist and we suffer the ramifications of that with
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840]   the pros and cons.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.840]   The pros and cons.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840]   The EU is pretty much pro capitalist.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.000]   You know, people in the United States would like to turn it into Denmark or Norway and
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.280]   you know, get a year off for maternity and have people have three years of job severance
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.400]   or two years of job severance.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:43.240]   If you do those kind of things while they seem great on a individual basis, sure, we
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.840]   all want to take a year off when we have a baby or we all want to have two years of
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   severance.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.200]   The problem is then people don't take create cutting age companies because they don't want
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.560]   to take the risk of being personally liable for people's salaries and and they have to
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.640]   go a little bit slower.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.400]   That's why the United States comes up with all these great companies and Europe comes
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.040]   up with very few to none.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.000]   There's a very little thing in Europe.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.480]   It's very difficult to get done.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.680]   But the corollary of that is that in the US, you have no safety net whatsoever.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.880]   So if you actually want to go and start your own company, you've got to abandon the choices
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.360]   of healthcare because that's something you have to pay through the nose for.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.280]   You've got to your way down with student debts, which to my mind is quite frankly economic
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.280]   surfed on board.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.280]   I think we agree.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   I mean, I think that's.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   Yeah, listen, there are going to be some ramifications.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.920]   We're also rugged individualists.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.000]   And I think that this is.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   You have to appearance.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.400]   Oh, we were all rugged individuals.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.920]   Why do I make that check?
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.600]   It's in the DNA.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.000]   I'm admittedly, we're not.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.520]   I'm not a rugged individualist, but please start at the station.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.840]   You can't chop wood.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.280]   But I do think that there is in the DNA of this country this sense of independence and
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:53.000]   self determinism that says we don't want a safety net because that is some sort of nanny
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   government.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.440]   And the opportunity to succeed or fail on our own rights.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.680]   But I agree with you, Jason.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.920]   We failed at that as well because their opportunity doesn't exist and income inequality is growing.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.520]   And that's why you're seeing a rebellion.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.120]   I mean, social economy is country is low than you.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.120]   Okay.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.120]   At the moment.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.120]   Yeah, no, it's clear.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.760]   There are some real failures here.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.640]   And adding to all of this is the fact that while we are arguing about the particulars of
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.040]   socialism versus full capitalism versus everything in between, there is a bigger trend that's
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.560]   occurring, which is artificial intelligence, robotics, could lead to the end of employment,
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:35.000]   could lead to a massive, a massive, um, deprecation of jobs.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.880]   And if that happens, you know, this kind of weird behavior, seeing like the Brexit or
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.040]   Donald Trump phenomenon, this could be the tip of the iceberg.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.560]   Operation Wall Street, I believe was like the dry run.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.080]   It was like this little peek into what discord could look like.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.400]   And if you look at what happened in Spain and Greece with full scale riots, you know,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.600]   this could be a common corner.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.840]   Yeah, we could be sitting here 10 years from now doing an episode and last month, Foxconn
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.600]   laid off, replaced.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.080]   They said we didn't lay off these 60,000 workers, but they replaced 60,000 workers with robots.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.280]   I'm pretty sure that 60,000 people didn't get other jobs.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.280]   Yes.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.000]   That this, and this is the beginning, this is happening in China.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.200]   This is the beginning of a complete transformation.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   I agree with you.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.880]   I mean, the, the advance in AI and robotics machine learning is going to bring around in
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.360]   terms of in the job front, something that's going to make the 30s, great depression look
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   like a cake.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.200]   Well, and, but if you ask Mark Andreessen, and by the way, I'm not thinking Mark knows
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.440]   what he's talking about, but if you ask Mark Andreessen, you know, when it comes to India,
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.720]   he's, his position is, well, what's going to happen is the cost of goods is going to
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.520]   drop so low that it's effectively free.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.080]   And so you don't need a job.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.080]   Is there credible in any sense?
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.480]   Well, there is something that, I mean, Star Trek kind of envisioned this, which is there's
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.440]   going to be this life leisure and people are going to find their pursuits.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.080]   That is a possible utopian vision that could happen.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.280]   Free electricity, free food, free, clean water, and even free housing is possible in our lifetime.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.960]   We could provide that for everybody.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.600]   And we're kind of on the way to that when you think about welfare or food stamps or
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   solar.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.640]   So there is this beautiful utopian society.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:13.320]   What it's going to take is a complete recalibration of what our expectation is in the United States.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.440]   We're going to have to expect maybe that this minimum viable income, you know, a huge
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.800]   universal income, which is a lot of tests going on around that.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.400]   Maybe that becomes a possibility.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.960]   We're going to need transportation to the suburbs and out to the far, the royal farms.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.840]   But our life, the second half of our lifetimes are going to be quite interesting.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.360]   And it's going to require a level of leadership that we just don't see today.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:42.120]   No, that's the problem is I can see that, but the getting from here to there is a massive
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.520]   disruption and seems like it will not be a peaceful transition.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.160]   I've got no, there's going to be blood on the streets.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.240]   Well, that scares me a little bit when you say no, no, it scares me too, because Anakis
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   mobs don't build chips.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   Is it truly?
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.240]   Is there anything we can do?
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.320]   It's not too late.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   It's not truly.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.000]   There's definitely going to be a lot of I am an optimist about it.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.120]   I think that, you know, there's so much wealth and prosperity in the world, and it's just
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.600]   not equally distributed yet.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:16.880]   But if you think about something, you know, people can buy a pair of jeans, and this is
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.960]   remarks points do make sense.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.760]   If you think about what it cost to buy a pair of jeans from when I was a kid in 1985, when
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.960]   I was 15 years old, it was 20 bucks, 25 bucks to buy a pair of jeans.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.600]   If you go to Old Navy or to Walmart, it's 10 bucks or 20 bucks to buy a pair of jeans,
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   and you think about the price of milk?
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.080]   Because it's made by Chinese slaves.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.080]   Exactly.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.840]   Well, slaves, or they would consider it that they're becoming part of the middle class.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840]   Right.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.840]   They're off a farm.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:39.840]   They have running water.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.800]   And so, until they figure out how to make jeans with robots and the ones with the farm,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.760]   which case it's, yeah, back to the paddy field.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.600]   So this is where we have to decide as a society how we're going to distribute wealth.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   And we're going to have to close up certain loopholes.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.320]   Like the fact that we have a capital gains tack, we don't let individuals own stock in
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   private companies, right?
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.480]   You have to be accredited investors.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.640]   So isn't the Jobs Act changed that?
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.640]   It's starting to.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.640]   And it's just a...
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.640]   You think that's a good thing?
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.040]   Of course, because 97% of the people in the country cannot invest in private companies,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.720]   they can't invest in things that could really have a currency.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   That's the main concern.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   In terms of income standards.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.960]   And the theory is you have to be an informed investor.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.520]   It's too easy to take advantage of people.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.600]   But that's where the opportunity is.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:22.360]   And then the people who are on the top are only paying capital gains tax.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.760]   So they pay this very de minimis amount of tax compared to income tax.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.120]   There's a big gap between those two things.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.480]   So we just have to maybe get rid of the capital gains tax.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.560]   We're going to have to tax people a little bit more.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.760]   Higher income tax, no capital gains tax.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.200]   You're going to have to wipe out the income tax.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.120]   You're going to have to just provide people with free housing if they need to or free
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120]   food.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.120]   We're going to have this as ever.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120]   This is so utopian.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.680]   It's happening in Utah right at the moment.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.280]   Yeah, this is a lot of experience.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.400]   No, in Utah they don't have a homeless problem because they give homeless people a housing
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   first is a fact.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.480]   I actually mentioned them into finding a job.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.120]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.600]   Taking care of a homeless person is going to be roughly $30,000 to $90,000 a year because
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.400]   of emergency room visits and all the other things we have.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.960]   Food stamps and Medicare.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.600]   It's also a basic crime.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   Yeah, everything.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.840]   You're talking about a progressive agenda that this country will never.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.840]   It's the antithesis.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   This country has already embraced it.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.800]   What do you think Medicare and Medicaid are?
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   Yeah, this is the tipping point.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.200]   We're in the middle of this program.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.480]   This is why it's a 5248 vote.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.640]   It's because we're on this tipping point where half the country feels they're left behind
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.960]   and half the country feels like we got to keep it the way it is.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.240]   And there's no clear path.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.040]   And that's why I registered mayor@json.com.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.920]   You're going to run for mayor at San Francisco, aren't you?
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.920]   I'm just thinking, now that I see you.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.640]   There's been this rumors been floating around.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.640]   I registered the demand.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.160]   And by the way, having a reality show as we now know is actually great.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.800]   It's clearly their political career.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.080]   No, I actually think that one of the great failings right now, the technology industry,
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.160]   is that people like Charles Samberg and Mike Bloomberg, Steve Kay.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.920]   The so-called smart people.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.360]   Well, they're clearly extremely successful.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.560]   I know all the individuals I'm mentioning are all brilliant.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.560]   I know them.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.240]   I've had many conversations with each of them.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.240]   These are all brilliant people.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.240]   And they care.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.600]   They care deeply, but you know what?
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.520]   They have to step up and they've got to take office.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   And you know what?
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.840]   When you're on the back nine and you're 50, 60, 70 years old, we have to get these intelligent
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.280]   people to start getting involved in politics.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.120]   Because the solutions that we face are not solutions that can be solved by career politicians.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.120]   That's why people hate Hillary.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.680]   That's why this is anti.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.320]   They just think, well, this person is bought and paid for.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.760]   And we can't trust them.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:30.040]   We're going to have to have a different cohort coming into public service.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.080]   I want to point out Jerry Brown, who was in quietly behind the scenes running California
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.360]   as a career politician, we might add, better than anybody has in decades.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.800]   And this is a tough state because it's a weak governorship.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.920]   We have a crap legislature.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.200]   And yet he's managed to do some things that we need.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.280]   I mean, we would be we're dying in a drought here.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.040]   And he's managed to do some things to force some things through that actually have made
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.280]   a difference.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.440]   So maybe a career politician is not the bad thing.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.760]   Maybe it's the right career politician.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   I don't think that.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.200]   Look, if somebody says, I want to devote my life to civil service.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.160]   And I think that's clear Jerry Brown is an example of that.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.040]   He has not enriched himself in any way by being civil service.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.520]   You can't pay with one brush, obviously.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.840]   But we do feel that the system, I think overwhelmingly people feel the system's rigged.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   No, I understand that.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.440]   The more the rich and capitalist and for politicians.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:26.400]   And the fact that those two groups are so in cahoots where these entrepreneurs and capitalists
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.360]   are paying off the presidential candidates and the representatives.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:36.640]   It's even more reason for the burn it down party is going to get bigger and bigger.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   And you know what?
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.400]   Maybe Trump becoming president and Brexit is part of an overall process that will lead
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.920]   to inspiring the Bloomberg's who should have run this time.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.720]   And I think Mike Bloomberg made a horrible mistake in not running this time.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.240]   I think he was electable.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.520]   And I think if you look at how horrible this has all turned out for our country, how terrible
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.080]   the dialogue is, if Mike Bloomberg was out there.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.320]   I think he becomes the obvious vote, the most qualified person.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.840]   You see, this is what really worries me about the Brexit vote is that even the Leave campaign
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.720]   didn't think they were going to win.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.520]   The head of the Leave campaign, Nigel Farah, or one of the heads, Nigel Farah, was a protest
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.520]   vote, neither.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.520]   Yeah, actual.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.200]   I mean, he went on TV and he said basically when the vote closed, yeah, we think we've
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.280]   lost this one, but you know, we may come back to it later on.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.520]   And then as the night went on, he realized how close it was getting.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.080]   He changed and it was just like, yeah, we'll get them now.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.440]   And I agree with you, something has got to change, Jason, but the caliber of the people
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.120]   who are now taking this over are going to burn.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.760]   More Johnson may well be the next prime minister of England.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.760]   They're opportunists.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.760]   Don't even get me started on that.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.440]   These are opportunists, you know, but one of the...
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.880]   Actually, I think that's very clear.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.040]   He's a very powerful opportunist.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:52.200]   He decided literally at the last minute he was going to vote for me and my career and
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.520]   not what's good for the election.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.280]   It's arguable that Trump's entire campaign is a trolling campaign to build his publicity.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.400]   I mean, a lot of people felt he ran.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.680]   I feel confident that that's what started.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   Yes.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   And so now...
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   And what surprised him is his success.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.520]   And I think he's probably a little challenged by the notion that he could win.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   I don't think he wants that job.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520]   No.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.520]   I think he wants...
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.520]   It's a big pay cut for one thing.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.680]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   It's disturbing.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.960]   But at the same time, he's going up against Hillary, who is the ultimate establishment
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   candidate.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.760]   And I think one thing that has shown us is that establishment candidates who are relying
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.680]   on, well, it couldn't possibly happen.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.800]   They couldn't possibly vote for that person.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   They will.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.000]   They really will.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.400]   And I'll say it here on this show, I honestly think Donald Trump will be the next president
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.400]   in the US.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   All right, let's make a...
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.640]   Can you mark that and keep that clip?
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.240]   Well, it's three to one right now on bad fair in these places, right?
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   Three to one he'll win?
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   No, no, three to one against.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.240]   If you look at the polls, it's three to one against.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.240]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.280]   Three to terrorist attack in this country in the two months before the election.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.280]   He's in there with a bullet, quite literally.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.600]   Well, I think the thing that's really interesting to me is that this is clearly a beginning
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.400]   of a revolt against the...
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.600]   Not just the political class, but they lead in journalism as well.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.960]   In the media, in political, in government.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.720]   And I don't think it's an unjustified revolt.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   I hate to say it.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   I mean, this is how Rome...
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.720]   This is how Rome...
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.200]   What said is there are opportunists like Boris Johnson will say, ah, let me...
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.880]   Let me ride that wave.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.880]   He would personal power.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.080]   He would much rather reign in hell and serve in heaven.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.080]   I mean, it's as simple as that.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.080]   This is all about him.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.080]   A man without hope is a man without fear.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.160]   There's a lot of people who have no hope right now.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.160]   No, exactly.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.320]   In both our countries, it's a really difficult situation.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.360]   That's a daredevil quote for those of you.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.200]   For those who are playing along at home.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.400]   Things are getting the daredevil quote in and...
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   Frank Miller.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.640]   Yeah, nothing like him.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   We're going to take a break.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:56.320]   I know some people are saying, well, this is political, not technology, but I think it
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   affects every...
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   The technology revolution is...
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:05.120]   The technology revolution is what's driving this in the lack of jobs and automation and
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.000]   efficiency and AI.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   These things are dovetailing.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.760]   There's no difference between society and technology.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.240]   20 years ago, Jeremy Rifkin wrote a book called The End of Work that foretold this.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.240]   It's been obvious.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.120]   We've known this has been coming for decades.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.960]   And we haven't known quite what to do about it.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.440]   It's coming faster now.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.920]   And like a lot of technological revolutions, it's starting...
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.920]   It's exponential.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   It's hard to...
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   The opposite club predicted this.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.520]   I mean, he basically said, you know, after the collapse of communism, 30 years later,
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.480]   you had the collapse of capitalism and you've got a mishmash between the two, which actually
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   worked for the majority of people in the world.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.360]   Now, he was wrong about a lot of his predictions, but he was right about some.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.040]   I'm thinking I want to move to Scotland.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.040]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.440]   Well, it's good.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.440]   I was...
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.920]   As a half-scot, I love the country.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.560]   I think you might have problems there as a Californian because the winter's...
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   But my mom's...
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.040]   My mom's main name is Dunlap.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.040]   My middle name is Gordon.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.200]   We are scots going way back.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.960]   And brutal winters just make you stronger.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   Yeah, you see...
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.960]   You say we are...
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   That's true.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   We are scots.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   There's a lovely shop you should visit in Edinburgh.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   That's the Haggis.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.080]   It's the official Edinburgh kill shop.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.080]   And they have a date...
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.080]   Oh, I've got me plaid.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.080]   I've got me on plaid.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.080]   They have a database there.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.080]   And...
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.080]   Yeah, they're looking at...
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.080]   And they're just going in there.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.080]   So, like, what's your name?
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.080]   I've got the...
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.080]   Oh, yes, you're a Campbell clown.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   Yeah, but Dunlap is plaid.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.080]   You know, I mean, it's...
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   I've got me on sporting.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.080]   It's me too, the badger handbag.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.080]   Which makes using a laptop on the train really awkward.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   It's going to have your legs apart to get the sporing down.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   If you get your legs apart when you're wearing a kill, then you're possibly...
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.760]   Do not wear a sporting on the train.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.720]   No, absolutely not.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.720]   And certainly don't spread your legs while wearing a kill.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.720]   Where are you going?
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   Is that a curiosity?
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.040]   I'll tell you where the everybody thinks the safest place to be.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.600]   Where is Larry Page's island?
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   I can't say it.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   Yeah, you do.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.600]   I know exactly where it is.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   Oh, that's one.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   All right.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.600]   He does, actually.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   Of course he does.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   But I'll tell you what's your biggest.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.080]   That's what I think probably is.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.560]   You could tell us a little insight into this.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.480]   But if I'm one of these mega rich, are you not making plans for...
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   Oh, no, they all have plans.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   I'll tell you.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   There's like a safe room.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   New Zealand is the place.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.480]   Yes.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   There's a lot of people.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.480]   New Zealand is...
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.480]   New Zealand is...
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.480]   New Zealand is self-sustained.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.280]   I know a lot of people who got ranches there.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.680]   They've been to them twice.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   Like they literally buck them out.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.080]   As long as you're like mutton, you're safe.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   You can fly there.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   Nobody else can get there.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.800]   It's rich in natural resources.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.320]   And that's the parachute place.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   Really?
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   You have to pull the parachute.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.320]   New Zealand is supposed to be the place.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   Yeah, I have heard this as well.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.320]   I mean, there's an American company...
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.000]   Is Larry Page have a go bag at the door just waiting?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.560]   I don't know if Larry Page has a go bag.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:52.480]   I do think that a lot of affluent people do believe that there's a 10 or 20% chance that
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.280]   things could go very badly.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.200]   The storming of the best deal might be just a few years away.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   And you don't want to be the guy on the guillotine with your head in the back.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.000]   We saw a little peek at it when Operation Wall Street actually went to Mike Bloomberg's
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.040]   townhouse in Manhattan and they all went outside of it and they protested.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:13.280]   And that was when you really said, "Hey, if you squeeze the middle class too much and
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.440]   people don't have hope and society becomes not equitable and people feel like they're
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.760]   out of control," there is a burn it down moment.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.080]   And it's just unfair the way we've structured society right now.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.040]   We have to really think through how people are going to...
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.360]   I can't even agree though.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.360]   This is the problem.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.800]   We might all have hearts of gold and really want to do something about this, but there
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.360]   doesn't seem to be a lot of agreement about what to do and how to do it.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.000]   Universal basic income is going to...
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Very controversial.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.920]   Very controversial, but I think it's going to become less controversial because if you
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.240]   take the sum total of all of the social programs we do and you just say, "You know what?
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.080]   We're just going to give everybody a thousand dollars.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.720]   It's going to wind up being cheaper and it's going to wind up feeling more equitable."
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.080]   There's going to be a chance of it's anti-American to just give people a check every month.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.080]   It's socialist.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.440]   It'll feel socialist, but it also might...
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.840]   Please, I'm sorry, ask your oil industry about socialism.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.160]   They get 80 billion a year in government subsidies.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.160]   The Europe Progressive Fund.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.480]   Gee, hasn't paid a tax bill this year.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.440]   In fact, they got a tax credit.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.960]   What about anonymous?
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:21.240]   I think anonymous, which has been very active in Occupy Wall Street, has the skills and
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:28.960]   I spelled that with a Z to dox everybody.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.560]   Your head and my head and probably not Ian's head.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.160]   No, my notes.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.360]   We'll roll.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.120]   Well, a topic up to the point.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.680]   This week is dystopia.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.800]   No, I think it's time to...
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.480]   Frankly, one of the reasons I want to bring this up, not only because Ian was here, but
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.800]   I think it's time that the tech industry and we as journalists face this head on.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.960]   I think we've been kind of looking at scans at this and going, "Hey, you know..."
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.960]   It's not going to happen.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.000]   If you look at Zuckerberg, he's been fighting...
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.840]   His corporate mission is to connect the world.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.000]   A connected world is better.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.160]   Then they have this little issue about the thumb on the scale with the trending news topics
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.160]   fine.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:17.000]   Probably some rogue people just don't want to link to Breitbart or Drudge or whoever.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Fine.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.440]   But then he starts carotowing to the really far right, bringing them in and not addressing
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.160]   any of the issues that Trump brings up.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.840]   I don't think you have to be political to say, "I'm going to look at a policy that Trump
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.360]   has or a policy that Hillary has and address those."
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.960]   I think it's cowardice on Zuckspart.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.440]   If you make $50 billion and then you're silenced by presidential candidates, that's the point
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:45.720]   of having $50 billion, you should come out and say, "Listen, Trump's ideas around immigration
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   are insane."
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   Apple's done this.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   Apple said, "We are not going to support..."
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   Where is everybody else?
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.720]   Where's Larry Page?
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   Where is Mark Zuckerberg?
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.720]   Where is everybody else?
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.600]   Google's putting big mucks into the Republican convention, so is Facebook.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   It's just a matter of...
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   You don't have to.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.000]   I understand that every time I talk about this.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.840]   I think this is what I was saying, which is a reluctance to look at head on at what
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.080]   might be happening and to say, "You know what?
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.120]   We have to take a leadership role at this point."
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   It's required.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.120]   It's still living in hope.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.120]   You know what?
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.120]   Hillary will get elected.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   It'll be things back to normal.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.120]   The elite will be in charge.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   Everything will be fine.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:20.080]   You can't be silent on something as insane as we're going to pull 10 million people out
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.880]   of their homes and drag them across the border.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   This is...
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   Stop.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.120]   I mean, okay, we'll just get there.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.920]   I mean, this is like there's only one corollary to this.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   So you brought us there.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.520]   You brought us there for the first commercial break, but that is the issue.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.640]   You have to address people's ideas.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.000]   And there's nothing wrong with addressing ideas.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   You don't have to be political.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.240]   I'm not going to tell you what I'm voting for, but I can tell you this one particular
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.360]   idea of building walls and being an isolationist.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360]   Mark said that horrible idea.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.920]   Mark said Bill Bridge is not walls.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.360]   And then he totally folded.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.640]   And then he totally hid.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.000]   And now he won't bring it up.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   And you know what?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   It's cowardice.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.160]   And I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to step up because he has a platform that has 1.4
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.160]   billion people on it.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.480]   He needs to let people know.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.160]   This is the antithesis of my vision for the world.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   So I'm saying it.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.160]   I mean, it just, this is the problem with Brexit.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.920]   This is the problem with Trump is that far too many journalists aren't willing to maybe
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.000]   sacrifice access for asking some tough questions like, are you serious?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.080]   You know, Mark is not a business man.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.560]   No, journalist, Mark is a businessman.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.240]   Business is fundamentally amoral, not immoral, amoral.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.600]   It doesn't take stands.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.840]   His job, his responsibility to the stakeholders is to maximize profits.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.840]   Period.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.560]   And then he's being, he represents a platform that lets over a billion people on the planet
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.560]   communicate.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.680]   And he's already put out there that he wants the world to be more connected, to be more
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   just and more fair.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.760]   And he created a foundation to do that.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.840]   You can't take, you know, this incredible high road and say, you're going to make the
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.160]   world a better place.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.400]   And then when you have somebody who is proposing something that's going to make the world
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.560]   horrible, then fold your opinion.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.760]   I don't think you can do that as an individual.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.120]   I think it's cowardice.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.960]   And I think somebody needs to just sit there and say, you know what?
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.120]   Stop thinking about your shareholders for a second here.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.600]   Stop thinking about, and just think about how insane these ideas are.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.160]   There are some insane ideas out there.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   They need to be addressed.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.600]   And people just need to say, listen, whatever you think of Trump is fine, whatever you think
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.360]   of Hillary's fine, Bernie, just address the ideas.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360]   Free college for everybody?
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.920]   That's not a crazy idea.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:22.520]   Building a huge border and being an isolationist with China and moving 10 million people
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520]   who are actually worried.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.840]   Those are crazy ideas.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.880]   Those are horribly bad ideas.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.040]   No, I agree totally.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.720]   I mean, and the consequences are severe.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.240]   We've seen in the last couple of days in the UK since this vote came through a massive
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.920]   spike in anti-immigrant violence.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.760]   The Polish had got me.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.560]   One of the Polish community groups has just been vandalized.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.960]   They had their headquarters vandalized without the polls.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.600]   We wouldn't have sworn the Second World War.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.400]   Didn't the Leave campaign really play on that with a lot of pictures?
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   Oh, hugely.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.960]   Floods of immigrants coming into the country.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:58.200]   They used, there was a very interesting case where they had a Leave campaign poster, and
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.440]   then they put it, and they were breaking Godwin's law on this one, but they used a
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.440]   poster.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.280]   The poster was a reliance of refugees coming into Slovakia in '91 after the Wall Fair
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.280]   fell.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:16.040]   Then somebody then found an old Nazi advert about Jews coming into it, and it was the
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:21.360]   same picture of lines of people coming in and just had their hair for your jobs and your
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.360]   own.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.880]   Isolated as we are from the refugee crisis.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.520]   How many refugees have we led in?
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.520]   Oh, very few.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.000]   You created a few million.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.800]   A hard country to get to.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.240]   It's easy for us.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.120]   We're sitting across the ocean saying, "Yeah, well, that's a bad story."
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:44.640]   I am not completely unsympathetic to this notion of Syrians and others flooding England,
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.160]   and especially with the fears of terrorism.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.600]   I'm not saying I want to demonize that.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.000]   You can take a demonize you compared to Germany compared to...
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   No, I understand.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.920]   And how is it working fine, or is it?
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   No, it's working fine.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.640]   One of the reasons that Germany wanted these people to come in in the first place was because
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.480]   it has a massively aging population.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.160]   It's a work force.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   We have exactly the same problem in the years.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.160]   And it's a source of innovation.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.680]   Is it not a source of brains?
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:11.840]   I mean, if you look at all the great startup companies here in the United States, it's
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   typically...
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.840]   And it's kind of a joke in the venture industry is that you want somebody who's a son of
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.160]   immigrant parents, exactly.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.160]   Exactly.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.800]   Because they're going to just understand hardship, they're going to care, they're going to want
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   to work harder.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.680]   So in the words of Hamilton immigrants, we get the job done.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.680]   Absolutely.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.000]   That, by the way, is a huge applause line in the show.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.480]   Ah, okay, really.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.880]   Interesting, isn't it?
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.480]   We talked the talk, do we walk the walk?
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   That's the question.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.960]   Okay, I suspended all rules of the show.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.720]   But I think it's something we got to look at.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.760]   And one of the things I've seen people like Jay Rosen, who I hugely respect, journalism
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:56.760]   professor at NYU, saying we as the media have to address our complicity in this.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.240]   And we got to talk about it.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.240]   Okay.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.240]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.240]   I'm sure there's something in tech to talk.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   iPhone 7.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.240]   Yeah, all right.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   What's with the headphone jack?
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   I got to ask you.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   See this?
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.240]   Now onto a letter fair.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   This.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.240]   This.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.840]   You see, it's easier to disagree and fight over small things.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.840]   And it is big things.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.840]   Oh, God.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.320]   Small things we can really touch.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.320]   We can go.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.320]   We can get into it.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.520]   Hey, I want to thank you for being here.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.520]   I know.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.680]   I know this is probably a challenging half hour for a lot of people.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.520]   A lot of people shouting at the screen.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.960]   Right now podcast appliance.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.960]   Yeah, we're getting a certain amount of the conversation.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.720]   I think the chair has been very interesting.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.240]   The reaction on Twitter is pretty good.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.240]   The channel's been very interesting.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.800]   I think it's it's there's a lot of there are, of course, a few loons out there.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.400]   Because there was all but it's a lot of people thinking seriously about this.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.920]   One of the things I always hoped for with Twit is that we would not be ashamed to be
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.920]   intelligent.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.920]   Right.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:03.520]   And we would not try to dumb stuff down in an attempt to curry favor with an audience.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.880]   And so we trust our audience and we're willing to branch into areas that perhaps are uncomfortable
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:14.400]   or difficult or even that you might disagree with because I think we trust you and your
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.640]   judgment and we don't I don't want to make this be a place where we just go, oh, it's
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.640]   shiny and bright.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   I want one.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.200]   They're complex issues.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.800]   And these are important issues for everybody.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.760]   And technology is a huge, huge factor here driving.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   I think that's really interesting.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.560]   And it's only that part's only going to expand.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.000]   Well, we saw it this week.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.760]   It's it's a very interesting time for using technology to actually be a machine.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.600]   Well, it's good time to actually use technology to open opportunities for if you're a robot,
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.160]   man, this is this is everything you've been hoping for.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.320]   They don't have to.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.800]   All right.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.360]   So they brought to you by a square space.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:56.880]   You know, everybody now gets a voice and while that can make a cacophony, it is ultimately
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.000]   democratic and this is the thing I celebrate about the internet.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.200]   The best place, the first place you should go is have a website.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.680]   You got to have a website.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.320]   You just find have your Twitter handle and your Facebook page, but you got to have a
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.680]   website and this is doubly true.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.200]   If you're a business, the business without a website is like a business without in the
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.320]   old days, a telephone.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.140]   This is how people, I don't do business with, I mean, I can't go to their website and find
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.140]   out more about them.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:27.080]   I don't care if you're a tree surgeon, a plumber, a baker, a candlestick maker, you
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.600]   got to go and make a website.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.160]   And the best place to do it is square space.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.560]   You've said it yourself, Jason, square space has completely changed the landscape because
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.840]   web technology is moving so fast.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.320]   You don't want to hire an engineer to use some web technology that in a year is going
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.560]   to be completely different.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.720]   You don't want to hire a designer when styles and fans will change next year.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.000]   You want to let square space do it.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.360]   They've got the best designers, the best engineers, making the best sites.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.000]   All you have to do is pick a template, customize it so it reflects your personal style and
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   ethos.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   You've got a great website.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.280]   It's mobile responsive, so it looks great on any size page.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.880]   It's got all the SEO handles.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.160]   You're going to get great results from Google.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.600]   It has e-commerce built into each and every template.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.000]   They've got new templates for people who want to do magazine style stuff.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.920]   They've got the grid style landing pages, the infinite scroll.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.680]   This is something that all of a sudden everybody was doing.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.800]   If you were to engineer this to buy the technology, it would cost you hundreds of thousands.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.600]   You go to square space and you got it.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.680]   In fact, you get it free right now with their free trial.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.960]   You get related posts at the bottom encouraging visitors to explore more.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.040]   There's author profile pages.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.720]   Research is integrated into the header so readers can get to where they want on your
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.840]   site fast.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.640]   That's just one example of the many different templates for bands, for restaurants, for
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.600]   journalists.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.640]   Now that they sell domains, square space domains, you get a free custom domain name with an
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.640]   annual purchase.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.520]   You get access to 24/7 customer support.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:02.760]   Instead of those awful landing pages that those other domain name sellers give you,
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:07.520]   you'll get, if you get your domain, your top level domain at squarespace.com, a beautiful
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.560]   spam free parking page.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.400]   When you're ready, it breaks it.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.240]   Let's create a Brexit page.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.520]   When you're ready to start building your page, it's going to be there.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.680]   When people come to your site, they're going to see it and they're going to say, "Oh, that
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   looks great."
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.400]   The cover page alone, that's how I got started.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.360]   I made a cover page that said, "Well, that was easy.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.480]   Let me make a whole website.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.760]   Power your business with Squarespace.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   Commerce, the only platform that lets you create, manage and brand your store in a beautiful
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.200]   way, except payments instantly."
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.880]   They recently introduced advanced analytics for commerce, which lets you view how visitors
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:45.000]   are interacting in real time with your commerce, what you get for a ban and checkouts.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.880]   There's device filtering so you can see who's visiting you and how.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   It's really impressive.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.240]   They have this new Squarespace Circle.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.280]   If you've built three or more active Squarespace websites, and I know many of you do this,
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.640]   you can get the Squarespace Circle, which includes membership, includes advanced guides,
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.000]   organized support, six month trial periods for new projects and more.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.200]   One million customers.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.520]   Now, that's a big deal.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.160]   They cross the one million customer threshold.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.360]   Start your free trial at squarespace.com.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:14.280]   When you buy, all we ask is just use the offer code TWIT.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.640]   You'll get 10% off.

[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   Squarespace.com.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.880]   Offer code, Twit, for 10%.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.360]   There is a difference between users and daily active users.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.840]   I learned that on Sunday night on Silicon Valley.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.400]   I haven't watched the whole season.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.400]   I won't say anything.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   I won't say anything.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.320]   It's very funny though.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.560]   Because lots of downloads.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.520]   And then they go, wait a minute.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.840]   What's the daily active users?
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:38.840]   What's the data?
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.520]   It's really interesting how they're getting it right.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.360]   Not only getting it right, but getting this stuff like Dows into the mainstream.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.240]   Yeah, well, they sent their researchers to everywhere around the valley.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.520]   So they came to my poker game one time and they asked me a bunch of questions.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.520]   That's really cool.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:59.520]   That's a great idea.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.520]   That's a great idea.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.520]   They've had everything.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.520]   It's a very similar thing to the show.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.520]   Instead of just making it joke.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.520]   Normally talented in that regard.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.520]   If you haven't seen "ideocracy," by the way, prophetic.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.520]   I hadn't seen "Office Space" till I came to this country.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.520]   I was so great.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.520]   I was so great.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.520]   I was like, this is brilliant.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.520]   "ideocracy" is just going to become the seminal piece of work.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.520]   If it's a sleeper, it's a romantic.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:27.160]   It was telling me that thanks to "Office Space," the swing line stapler had a huge growth,
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.560]   a huge market surge.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.520]   I'm sure it's a go-to gift in the offices.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.520]   It's my sleeplar.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.520]   It's my stapler.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.520]   It's my stapler.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.520]   Well, it's fun to understood what all his memes are about for stuff.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.520]   You cannot understand our culture if you haven't seen "Office Space."
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520]   Exactly.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.520]   Exactly.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.520]   Exactly.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.520]   Of course, I...
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.520]   Yeah, you're going to give me that TPS report.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.520]   Of course.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.520]   Yeah, I mean, I mean, I...
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.520]   I'm going to sit there and just...
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.520]   Here he is, he's melting.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   Can you hear melting?
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.520]   It's hilarious.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.520]   You hear melting?
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.520]   Poor guy.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.520]   He plays this.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.520]   He plays this.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.520]   It is a work of genius.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.520]   Pretty great.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.520]   You're just doing...
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.520]   Swiller.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.520]   And he's gonna line up his mutton and I can...
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.520]   I just love when he takes the screws to his...
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.520]   Oh, and the whole cube and the whole thing just falls down.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   He's like, "I left this much better."
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.520]   Oh, classic.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.520]   All right, I've showed the total amount I can show without violating copyright, so let's
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.520]   just close that away and put that away and toss us out.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.520]   Thank you, Squaresmith.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.520]   I use it for everything I do.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   Are you an investor?
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.520]   I'm not an investor, full disclosure, I wish I was.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.520]   But no, I use it for all my sites because you know what...
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.520]   They're not public.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.520]   Not yet.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.520]   Hey, what's that?
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   Okay, so...
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.520]   Not yet.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.520]   That's a perfect answer.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.520]   Dan Lyons.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.020]   Just read his Disrupted.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.520]   All about HubSpot.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.920]   And Dan is quite a...
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   But a cranky fella.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.920]   Cranky fella.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.920]   I love Dan.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   It's a polite way of putting it.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.920]   In fact, we're trying to get him on this week and Google is a regular.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.920]   I think we will.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:07.520]   But one of the kind of an indictment, frankly, of this whole system of early stage investing,
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:15.240]   venture capital, IPO, and I think one of the Occupy Wall Street points kind of redounds
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.280]   to this, which is it's a freaking scam.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   These companies never...
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.920]   HubSpot never made any money.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.480]   They were a multi-billion dollar.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.280]   They were double unicorn, raised money on the stock market.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.480]   Stock price went up, never made...
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.480]   They're still around.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   You're saying never made a profit.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   They have revenue.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.480]   They have revenue.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.800]   And they have the key metric, which is growing, fast growing revenue.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   But they're spending more than they're making.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.040]   When did that not become an important factor?
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.080]   When capital markets opened up so much and the opportunity got so big that people like
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.240]   Amazon would say, "You know what, let's take a decade to defer making money and just
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.240]   making huge business."
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.240]   But that makes sense.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.240]   Amazon kind of filling them.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.760]   Amazon built distribution centers.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.520]   What it looks like, HubSpot, and others, I won't single that HubSpot, except that I just read
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.520]   this.
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.280]   You know, people are very big fans of their products.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.600]   What they're doing in others is they spend a lot of money to acquire customers.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.040]   They basically are buying revenue growth.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.040]   And so that looks like a pyramid game to be.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.840]   HubSpot is doing exactly the same thing.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.920]   Uber's never made money.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   I mean, they have revenue.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   They've never profited.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.280]   Well, you know, I've got a little bit of conflict here because I'm an early investor
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.480]   in Uber, but they're profitable in all their major U.S. cities.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:25.640]   So the problem is, and this is why I don't like the jobs act a little bit, is that this
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.840]   is a sophisticated field.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.240]   And it's very easy, I think, for people like me, unsophisticated investors to go, "Well,
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.240]   look at that.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   Stock price go up.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.240]   This has got to be a good investment."
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.560]   And not look at the balance sheet and go, "But wait a minute.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.160]   They're buying customers.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.520]   They're not making money."
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.160]   But it is a revenue printing machine.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.160]   That is a company that is--
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.160]   Uber is different.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.640]   That is a revenue printing machine.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.760]   And it's just like the sense that Google and Facebook are.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   And I'm not just saying that because--
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   It's clear if you look at Uber, it's an innovation there.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.320]   They're reinventing something.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.680]   But there are lots of companies that aren't really innovating, that are basically, it's
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.320]   a Ponzi scheme.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.880]   I wouldn't say, I don't think people go into it with a Ponzi scheme effort.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.760]   That would show, like, I have the intent to get a bunch of money in, not build a real
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:12.800]   business and then go to Brazil and run away with the money.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.680]   What's happened is I do think some people come in and they overspend.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.440]   And they think optimistically about the lifetime value of customers.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.680]   So this is where they spend $100 to get somebody to download an app or $10 to download an app
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.240]   and they think, "Well, if I keep this person for three years and I make $10 a year of them,
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.640]   sometime in year two I'll be up break even.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:35.400]   The problem is with the exception of video games on your iPhone and some other categories
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.840]   where people are willing to pay a lot of money and there's wells in the system who
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.200]   spend a lot of money, it's very hard to do."
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.440]   So the app economy was a perfect example of people spent a lot to acquire customers.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:49.720]   But then there were other examples where AOL at one point was spending a lot to acquire
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.720]   customers.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:55.080]   But they were also making $30 a month per customer at 1.25 or 30 hours a month per customer.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.240]   So it actually was a major, major...
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.080]   This is something I wanted to ask you about.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.400]   Someone on the front line, it strikes me, and I get pictures from startups the whole
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:08.800]   time and 90% of them get filed in the circular filing cabinet because they have no clear
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.960]   business plan.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:15.240]   They have no clear product to a path to series, revenue and profit.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.240]   But somehow they're getting money from people.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.800]   Is it just there's so much looses money sloshing around?
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.720]   Here's what Dan says in Disrupted.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:26.920]   He said, "HubSpot, the first thing that isn't hire an engineer, he said he used to be,
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.400]   you'd have a product, oh I got a great product.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.120]   Now let's make a business and sell this.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.880]   HubSpot, the first hires were marketing people and sales people.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.440]   They didn't even have a product.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.240]   This is a company built Bass Accords where they don't have a product.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.800]   They're building a company around an nonexistent innovation and saying, "Well someday we'll
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.760]   have something."
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.000]   It is a product for marketers.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.040]   I know a lot of people who use it and swear about the product, a lot of marketing companies.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.800]   So they definitely have revenue that's a very important company.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:02.440]   To your point Ian about how many startups there are, it's so affordable to start a startup
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   now.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.200]   It usually in the old days it costs $3, $4, $5 million to get a product.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   That's amazing.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.320]   Now it's $30, $40,000 to get a product to market.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   Thanks to AWS and all this.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.680]   If you are a developer it costs you nothing to get a product to market.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.840]   What I do is I'm looking for people when I invest who can get their product to market,
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.800]   get a little bit of traction and then I invest.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.800]   Right.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.480]   They've just figured out enough.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:27.400]   There is a problem of people who have never built anything and people give them money.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.800]   In a hot market like it was the last couple of years you did have people give a million
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.760]   dollars or a half million dollars to somebody to build an app based upon some designs on
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.760]   a piece of paper.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.200]   So that's a little bit out there.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   There's so much.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   So are we in the bubble?
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.160]   Well for sure there were a lot of bubble like behaviors.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.880]   And so usually what happens in these bubbles is there's a bunch of real stuff that's solid
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.680]   and there's some things that are not.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:58.280]   The good news is when things blow up now it's not like the dot com bubble where you had
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.040]   houses of cards where you had three or four thousand employees and there was no way this
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.680]   company was going to make it and three thousand people were going to be outside with their
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.680]   area on chairs.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.640]   You know, selling them for 50 bucks.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.400]   By the way it was a great time.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:14.200]   You could buy a good set of fun if your hands were 50 bucks and they cost it.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.000]   It's not like that right now.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.800]   But you do have what I call zombie companies where it's just people raise quarter million
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.960]   dollars, five hundred thousand dollars.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.040]   They get to five thousand a month in revenue, ten thousand a month in revenue.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.440]   It never breaks out but it can't be shut down.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.440]   The founders making a salary.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.280]   So you just got a lot of that like walking dead kind of experience.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.200]   It'd been a few big ones.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.200]   I mean the whole tharranos thing was just.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.800]   Well that just might be straight up fraud.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   Right.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   So in that case.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   Really you're going that far with that one.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.000]   I think it could be straight up fraud.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   Interesting.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   I figured they tried to make a book with them.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   I think you were a qualifier.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.880]   And I basically could be based upon how they responded to a crisis.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.440]   When you have a crisis of that magnitude.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.640]   They circled the wagons.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.760]   And they fought it to a level that was deranged in my mind.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.000]   I've never seen a company.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   No, exactly.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   You know, attacked the journalists personally and not go with facts.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.440]   And then they had to restate every lab result.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   It's unprecedented.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.880]   And then Walgreens backed out and nobody's seen the technology.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.920]   You know, there's a very easy way to respond to all the criticism which would be to show
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.520]   people the technology and to vet the technology.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:22.200]   And in a healthcare space, for those who don't know, they were doing blood and they were
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.640]   drawing very small amounts of blood to do very complicated tests.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.040]   Everybody in the world said it's not possible.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.040]   So if you.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:32.280]   But this is another example of a product that sounded hugely innovative would have made
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.280]   a huge difference.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.280]   Of course.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   Had it worked.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   I don't think it was fraud in the beginning.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:41.560]   I think Elizabeth Holmes, its founder, who didn't have any expertise in this area.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   No, she was a kid.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   But really wanted.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.560]   Dropped out.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.600]   And it could be done, hired the best scientist.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.080]   Turns out I think what happened is after much research, much effort, they've.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.080]   They failed.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.080]   It doesn't work.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.080]   And then they kept it fraud going.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.920]   They were stuck because they had a unicorn and they had a lot of investors and they had
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.680]   a lot of money and they couldn't say, or can you?
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.600]   Can't you at some point say, hey, guys, we were wrong.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:10.080]   That in fact, that's the thing that makes me lean towards my gut.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.080]   Mm hmm.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.400]   And if I didn't know the lee binding way.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.080]   It feels to me like fraud.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.680]   And Mike, what, what have Williams did with ODEO where he said, you know, perfect example.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.120]   We started a podcast company.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.320]   Turns out Apple's going to do it.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.520]   So there's no business here.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.080]   Here's your money back.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.080]   Right.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.080]   Here's 80 cents on the dollar.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.080]   20 cents on the dollar.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.080]   Whatever it is.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.080]   Whatever it is.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   He gave the investors as much money as he could back.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.560]   The logic of the way gave him a very good reputation.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.800]   It's the most credible thing you can do.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.040]   I've had it happen many times.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:39.280]   I had a company that got into trouble with a government agency.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   We said, hey, you know, what you're doing is very innovative.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.280]   I went to the name of the company.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:49.200]   This government agency, which is, you know, a humorless agency, said, this is not cool.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.880]   You need to stop.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.160]   And the person came to me and said, hey, they told us we can't do it.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.480]   And I said, okay, what's your plan?
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   Like give the money back.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.480]   I said, sounds great.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.480]   What's your next idea?
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:02.120]   Not a bad thing to do, especially if you have faith in the founders and their intelligence.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.600]   And these guys are dealing with the government agency who's saying, hey, what are you going
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   to do?
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.600]   What are you going to do?
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   And they're like, we're going to fight you tooth and nail.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.560]   We're going to attack the journalist, John Kerrywood at the Wall Street Journal.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.560]   We're going to say that they're on a she-hotting.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.560]   She-hot against us.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.400]   It's like, yeah, listen, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist from a Pulitzer Prize winning organization
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.080]   has their teeth hooked into you and you're responding with ad hominin attacks.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.080]   Just let's see the data.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.080]   That's the Smithsonian.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   That's not me.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.160]   And when they restated the data, a doctor came out and said, I sent somebody to the emergency
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.600]   room based on these results.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.560]   The new results, you're giving me, I would not have sent that person to a emergency room.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.720]   This is life and death stuff.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.520]   You do not mess with this stuff.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.520]   Further.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.520]   I mean, there's a lot of evidence.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.520]   We don't know what really happened.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.320]   I'm sure there is an investigation ongoing right now.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.720]   But hiring a board that was not medical experts but was-
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.560]   Oh, Paul, it's Henry Kissinger.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.560]   Henry Kissinger.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.560]   Oh, no.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.560]   Is he still alive?
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.560]   But, no.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.560]   Yes, he is.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.560]   He's amazingly-
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.920]   He's apparently never going to die.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.000]   I believe he's drinking the bloods of children.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   No, no, it's lizard people.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   I've been reading it.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.360]   Lizard, Jennifer Lawrence will be playing Elizabeth Holmes in a movie about Theranos.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.360]   She can play an illusional during the day.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   Of course, the guy, he's done some great-
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.520]   It's going to be awesome.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.160]   Movies along this line.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.160]   What was the one he did with-
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.720]   Was it The Big Short?
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.720]   Yeah, The Big Short.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:17.720]   Yeah, great.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.280]   Well, he's going to have to explain a complex topic and do it entertainingly.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.360]   As long as they got so many in a bathtub with bubbles and champer's, I'm happy.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.920]   That was hilarious, that's him.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.920]   That wasn't pretty funny.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   That was how they explained what-
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:29.920]   Credit Doods, the CDOs.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.080]   Yeah, let me explain how you do the credit swap.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.080]   And now I can't say that-
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.040]   I thought it was a little gratuitous but I have to admit, I enjoyed it.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.040]   It was-
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.040]   It was-
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   It was-
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.040]   It was-
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:43.920]   There's an Enron, you know, there's a Bernie made off.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.920]   These things happen.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.200]   These are great stories for movies but not so good for little investors who-
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.760]   The things little investors aren't going to get hurt this time.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.760]   It was all the big VCs.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.320]   Actually, a lot of the big VCs did not participate.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.800]   She got a lot of the big VCs, a lot of the ones I know passed because she wouldn't show
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.800]   them the tech.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:02.800]   Right.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   And in fact, once we were-
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.800]   They were smart enough to say no.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   Well-
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.800]   It was what the pension funds who invested-
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.000]   Yeah, I think it was a lot of private equity people and private funds.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.840]   One of the things I heard from somebody in the secondhand story was like somebody they
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:18.040]   knew was going for a job there, a highly technical person, they wanted to hire them,
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.080]   they wouldn't show them the tech before they joined.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.080]   Sorry.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.880]   It's like, this is getting kind of weird now.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:23.880]   I think I will.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.880]   Very weird.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.920]   You see, I feel kind of nervous about Magic Leap for much the same reason.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.440]   Yeah, that's another one where it's-
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.440]   They've got billions of dollars but if you look at those billions of dollars, they're
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.120]   coming from much more credible investors.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   True.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   Or it's much more credible.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.440]   Yeah, but they've been so hesitant to tell us how it works.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:45.400]   All you're showing is really misleading videos because the technology isn't there, they're
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.160]   just showing you what it might be.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.160]   Mockups.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.160]   Mockups.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.660]   Well, they did the whole thing with a wide journalist but wide's the cheerleader of the
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.660]   tech industry so I don't-
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.200]   Actually, it was with Kevin Kelly who I respect the fact speaking of which he's going to be
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.040]   our triangulation guest tomorrow.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.040]   Oh, Kevin.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.280]   Kevin Kelly did a long piece on Magic Leap and-
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.880]   He said legit?
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.560]   Well, you know, there was a back and forth on it.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.960]   I read a medium piece where I can't remember who said, "Well, Kevin, you should have been
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.440]   10 questions you didn't ask.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:18.080]   How does it work?"
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:23.400]   You showed us a demo but you didn't show us where those wires went.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.400]   There's a lot of-
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.240]   Unquash, quiet questions.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:32.960]   And I have huge respect for Kevin Kelly and I totally trust him but he may not have had
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.640]   the technical skills to evaluate what he was seeing.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.360]   He may have been showing a dog at a pony show.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   I don't know.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.360]   Kevin will be our guest and I didn't ask-
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:44.120]   I'm kicking myself now because I did not ask him about it on triangulation but he's
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:45.120]   going to join us.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.760]   He's got a brand new book which is fantastic.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.240]   I've been talking about it a lot.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.400]   It's called The Inevitable about the next 20 years and what technologies are going to
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.400]   change our lives.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.800]   And one of the things Kevin talked about was machine learning.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.760]   He said, "What's we are at just as you said earlier, we're in a revolution now where machine
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.880]   learning will be applied just as a thin veneer to everything."
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.840]   And we'll change everything.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:13.640]   Much the same way the internet is being applied to your toaster and your doorbell and your
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:20.480]   sprinkler system and it creates a huge industry and innovative force that's very powerful.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:25.840]   Great article by Stephen Levy a few days ago on Back Channel which was started at medium
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:26.840]   and now-
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:27.840]   Conde button.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:28.840]   Conde and S bought it.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.840]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:36.360]   Books about machine learning and Google's attempt to create machine learning ninjas
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:42.040]   but way down in the article parried a little bit and I think maybe not given as much importance
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.480]   as I think it deserves.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:49.280]   The fact that Google is now using machine learning on 90% of its search results.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.960]   When they first launched there, what was it called?
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:52.960]   Big brain.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   Google brain.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:58.680]   It came out of Google X.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:04.520]   When they first launched it, it was being used kind of experimentally with search which is
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.680]   of course the bread and butter at Google.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.880]   According to Stephen, and I think of all people, Stephen is the guy who really can look at
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.880]   something like this.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.880]   Super credible.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.680]   And get deep into it.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.240]   And I think he got somebody at Google to kind of admit something.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:22.440]   90% of all searches now through Google are going through machine learning.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.440]   They're going through the machine learning.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:28.320]   Well, they've always looked for human signals like so if you were to go to the number one
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:32.680]   search result immediately hit the back key and then go to the number two but then not
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:36.400]   come back, they can start to infer, oh, maybe you didn't get what you needed from number
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.200]   one but you did get what you need from number two.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.280]   Maybe two should be one, one should move down.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:45.080]   And so there's going to be a lot of sort of moments like that.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:49.600]   And then to the toast, for example, if you keep checking the toast for when it's ready
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:53.120]   and then you stop checking the toast, I think we know the toast is ready.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:57.760]   So it's going to know the next time exactly how you like your toast and then with sensors
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.720]   it's going to know and be able to visually see, you know, is a toast burnt or not.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:07.000]   So a lot of these ideas that we have where humans are coming and intervening on behalf
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.120]   of the machines to figure things out, it's just going to know.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.000]   It's going to know when you're getting to this exit at this time it's going to be slow.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.560]   You know, it's going to be backed up.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.000]   Oh, it's going to know through machine learning that there is a warrior's game and that there's
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.480]   going to be traffic on this route.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.200]   So we're going to take you on a different route or we're going to change the speed or
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.040]   the right lane is faster than the left lane, whatever it is.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:35.840]   And so it's definitely going to be the level of efficiency that's occurring now because
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.840]   of structured data.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.600]   Like if data wasn't structured, you can't really do this kind of stuff.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.400]   So if you remember 10 years ago we'd be on the show or talking on podcasts about oh,
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.200]   structured data, we're going to have big data, things are going to be organized.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:52.040]   You can't have a tool like Alexa when you say Alexa, play John Mayer on Spotify.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.200]   Oh, God, you just made John Mayer play hundreds of homes.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.080]   Only if they have Spotify, they don't have Spotify, it's going to fail on that one.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080]   That's getting close to you.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.800]   Alexa set a timer for seven minutes.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.800]   Sorry.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.080]   That's the next commercial break.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   Exactly.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.760]   But the thing with that is, you know, if you if you have structured data, then you can start
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.560]   doing this natural language searching and that machine learning can take over.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.400]   And so we're on this path, right?
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.880]   And we're accelerating.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.880]   It's accelerating.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.880]   Really interesting.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.640]   Five thousand recipes on Alexa now or something, a thousand recipes.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.480]   Well, we went out to see the, my wife and I went down to see the cure the other day and
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:31.040]   her Apple Maps was just like, well, it's going to be at least three hours to get down.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.400]   Now I did the same thing in Google.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.760]   So if you go down that street and that street, that's right.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   We saved just an hour.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.240]   All the signals that ways gets are hugely valuable to Google.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.240]   That's a good example.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:47.840]   Well, and Tesla's cars, you know, the number of self-driving cars Google has on the road
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.640]   is like dozens, low dozens.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.880]   Tesla now has a hundred thousand cars on the road that are connected.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.320]   How valuable is that?
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.280]   And now it's like, oh, well, they're going to have self-driving.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.480]   Just self-driving is really about the edge cases, obviously, like, you know, staying in
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.480]   the lane.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   We've had lane detection.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.120]   We've had adaptive cruise control.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.280]   A lot of this like a level of two.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   Get away with a lead with that.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:12.560]   We drove down I5 for eight hours over the weekend or actually last week.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.560]   And I can finally convince Lisa to use the adaptive cruise control.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.560]   It's amazing.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.560]   It stops.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.160]   It will literally stop if you're in stop and go traffic.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160]   Right.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160]   So, you have to keep your object?
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.160]   No.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.640]   Well, don't run into stationary objects.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.640]   That's a problem.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.640]   Not enough time to stop.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   No.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.640]   That's right.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.640]   You do have to keep your eye peeled.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.320]   And the Tesla makes sure that you have your hands on the wheel, right?
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.320]   There's a alarm.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.320]   Every X seconds, it shakes or something.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.040]   But then I saw somebody had put like a vice clamp on their steering wheel to fake it out.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.720]   Why would you try to fake out?
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.000]   It's Darwinism in action for goodness sake.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.680]   That's like he wants to do that.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.840]   Let him, you know, we'll pick him out the rubble later on.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.440]   Who needs a dead man switch?
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.440]   It is Darwin, isn't it?
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440]   It's a lot of Darwin going on there.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.440]   Elon's interesting though.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.320]   Speaking of data, I mean, the two times that they've been kind of in social media, big
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.200]   stories about Tesla's crash, Elon's released the, well, according to the data we have
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200]   here, you press the accelerator.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.640]   So, a guy's like, "My wife's a great driver."
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.440]   He's kind of like a Henny Youngman bitch.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.200]   This guy's like, "My wife, she's a great driver.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.880]   There's no way she jumped the curb and hit the thing."
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.360]   It was on as they caught it took over.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.360]   And it was like, "Okay."
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.360]   Right there.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.360]   It says, "I know."
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.360]   You could have put on the gas.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.240]   The gas is like, "Yeah, the data says you hit the, you missed the break."
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.760]   Does that make you nervous though?
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.800]   I mean, I know you know, Elon, you've got Teslas and I'm about, I'm hoping to get a
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   Tesla.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   Mine comes next week.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   Next week you're getting your answer.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   You're getting your answer.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   Okay.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   So jealous.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.440]   Mine in a couple of months.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.280]   Doesn't make you nervous that Elon can see everything you do.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.280]   I don't think they can.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.600]   Like, down to the point of like where he presses, where you press and see it later.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.720]   I don't think he, they have a cigarette like him.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.720]   I don't think they can.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.720]   No, they don't.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.600]   I don't think they keep all that data.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.920]   And I think in the privacy arrangements, they can just say like, "Hey, it's anonymized."
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.640]   And we can put the data of a crash up, but all cars can do that now with their backpacks
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.840]   in it so they have that.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.680]   So I think it's actually net net for society going to be pretty great that we're going
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.200]   to know when accidents happens, who was the actual cause of it.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.520]   It might be bad for people trying to cover up stuff.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.560]   Like some guy was using the, the Auto Summit feature.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.000]   The Auto Summit feature is specifically designed that you have to monitor the car as it pulls
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   out of your garage.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   Right.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.760]   So you press the button, your garage opens, the car comes out.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.480]   And because of the state laws, you can't even have it go into the street.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.560]   You have to keep it on your personal property.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:33.320]   And if you want to have these kind of experimental features, you have to read the manual.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.880]   And this person like did it.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.880]   Obviously, it's not watching.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.080]   Because if you drop the key, it stops.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.080]   Right.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.760]   And you know, and if you press anybody, it's going very, very slow.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760]   Five miles an hour.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   It backed into another car.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.760]   It's like, well, how did that happen?
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.760]   He's like, oh, it didn't stop.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.760]   It's like, well, we know it didn't.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.800]   It didn't stop because you didn't press the stop button.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.800]   Obviously, we're not watching.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.800]   Right.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   Like, it doesn't.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.480]   So it does deal with one of the central problems, which is humans lie all the time.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.880]   So, you know, it's just, any computer is just coming.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.880]   It's just coming in the truth.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.880]   It's making me nuts.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.000]   Well, no, you've seen this with a dash cam thing, though.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.600]   You know, I mean, initially dash cams were very popular in Eastern Europe because of certain
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.760]   laws which said if you were in an accident and you had to wait for the police to actually
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.200]   come and sort it out.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.920]   Now everyone's trying to get a dash cam because it solves so many problems in that if somebody
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.400]   runs into the side of you and then does a convincing acting job with the police from
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.520]   the new turns up to the accident report, you can get sent to jail.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.000]   Whereas you can just say, actually, just read that, would you?
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.560]   You know, and just watch that and then problem solved.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.480]   Let's talk about Elon's plan to merge with SolarCity.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.480]   Yes, brilliant.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:39.400]   So, Elon has, participates in SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.200]   His cousins run it, right?
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.560]   Yeah, Lyndon and his cousins run SolarCity.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.240]   I think he's a chairman on that.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.840]   I don't have any insight information on that.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.520]   So he is announced that he wants to acquire it or merge with it?
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.440]   It would be an acquisition, Tesla's a much bigger company.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.680]   I think he wants 20 billion, one's three billion.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.320]   But I love it because he wants to own the entire chain.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.120]   He wants to go all the way from the sun.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.120]   Makes perfect sense.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.120]   Makes perfect sense.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.920]   And the interesting thing about it is the press is just kind of sorting out this issue
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.200]   because it's kind of unprecedented that one person started two different companies like
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.560]   this or he was a fat, he was an investor in the ocean.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.160]   Does he have to recuse himself?
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.160]   And they did that.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.160]   So they're not voting.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.880]   It's up to the other shareholders to vote.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.920]   So the management teams are not voting on it.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.920]   It's up to the other ones.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.320]   But there is a big vision here, which is imagine you go to a Tesla store, you buy a car and
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.760]   they say, "Would you like solar panels and a power wall to go with it?"
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.160]   And now you're completely off the grid.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.080]   But by the way, we kind of did that ourselves.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.320]   I have the SolarCity panels.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.320]   Right.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.320]   I've ordered a power wall and of course I've ordered a Tesla.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.840]   And by the way, when you order a power wall, they ask you, "And what's your VIN, your Tesla
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.480]   VIN number two on a Tesla?"
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480]   Right.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.320]   And this is all going to be part of the, and then you can imagine, "Oh, well, what if
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:51.960]   you bought all three of those things because SolarCity is sold to you at the least?"
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.960]   At least.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.960]   So now I'm answering.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:54.960]   So now I'm answering.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.960]   So PPA, they...
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.600]   And again, I don't have any information, but imagine a world where you go to a showroom
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:05.120]   for a Tesla with solar panels in the power wall and then they say, "Hey, for $350 a
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.920]   month, would you like solar panels installed, a power wall, and a model for you?"
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   We'll do it all for you.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   And then all of a sudden...
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.560]   And electricity goes down, you're off the grid.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560]   And clean air.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.840]   We were driving in LA and it's smoggy as hell and there's all these cars and Lisa says,
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.840]   "All right, that's it.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.840]   I'm buying an electric car."
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.000]   It really convinces you, it really convinces you of the value of this.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   And this is LA now.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.760]   I mean, LA in the 1970s, I wasn't there, but I've seen the photos.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   It was more than one.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.760]   And I've been to Beijing.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:42.240]   I lived there and it was interesting to watch in the valley over 10 years, the smog was
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.960]   definitely going down because of not just electric cars, which were having a small impact,
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:50.360]   but also just regulation on carbon cars in California's very aggressive.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.360]   Yeah, it's controls and...
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   Mission's controls.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.280]   But I think China's going to be huge for this because I mean, you go to Shanghai and
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.360]   you come well and ship more than a few hours.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.360]   I won't go to China.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360]   Beijing is...
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.360]   It's like smoking five-pack cigarettes.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.360]   It was...
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.360]   It was...
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   You couldn't see.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.360]   It's a national crisis.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.360]   You couldn't see.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.320]   So he says this might make the first trillion-dollar company.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.000]   Yeah, I mean, if you think about the opportunity to get all of these homes in the United States
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.960]   off the grid and what it will do for society to have this massive amount of pressure taken
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:26.320]   off the grid, we sometimes fire over into coal to get energy.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.760]   If everybody started to put solar, and I think this is going to be a huge geopolitical
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.520]   impact, there's really a multiple impact, a multiplier here.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.440]   One, there's the environment.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.680]   Two, there's cost savings.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:44.120]   Three, there's geopolitical issues, which is do we want to have to buy oil from Venezuela,
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.600]   Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries that maybe don't have the same view of human
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.400]   rights as we do?
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:57.720]   And so this might create a parody where we become less dependent on them, and that's
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   already starting to happen.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.720]   It also has a sense of problems.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720]   And convenience.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.280]   I mean, it solves a problem in that we've been talking about the smart grid for over
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.960]   a decade now, and it just hasn't happened because nobody's going to invest in it.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.960]   With Musk's plans, you don't actually need necessarily a smart grid because you can
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.520]   store the power yourself, you can use it yourself.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.720]   It seems like a very sensible option.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.640]   Massively disruptive.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:24.480]   When you can start storing the two things that they dogged Tesla about and other EV companies
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.360]   were range anxiety, right?
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.120]   Solve that with the supercharger network, the larger batteries.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.000]   So we solve for that major issue of range anxiety.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.560]   The major objection to solar is, well, what if there's no sun?
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.000]   What if it's a cloudy day?
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   What if you live in a cloudy area?
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   Well, you know what?
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.680]   If you have the battery and what about nighttime, right?
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.080]   When you need air conditioning, it's a hot summer night.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.760]   We solve for that too.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.600]   So there are technological solutions that if you have the wherewithal and the investment
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.480]   ability, which these companies take large amounts of investment, can really change the
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   world.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.440]   This is something that transcends just solar city and Tesla.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.880]   This is something for the United States and for humanity in the world, we need to get
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880]   to.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.040]   So I think this could be a very powerful combination.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.040]   And every single--
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.680]   How important is the gigafactory to this?
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:15.160]   It's absolutely critical that we make the batteries here and that he has a supplier
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.560]   that can provide the batteries.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.920]   I mean, again, I don't have any inside information about it, but the number of batteries he's
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.880]   going to need to fulfill, I think it's close to 400,000 orders for the model three.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.960]   And by the way, there was this weird rumor like, oh my God, people are just buying a
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.240]   bunch of tickets to like resell them.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.280]   It turned out that like 2% of people had bought more than one.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.400]   So there's not this, like people are buying up a thousand reservations to resell them,
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.680]   which is also an indicator that something good's going on.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.840]   But there also reports that he's building a factory in China too for the Danland.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.760]   One of the things he'd sort of build the gigafactory as is two years ago was that we're
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.200]   building and we're investing in American jobs and doing what Apple and the other companies
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.200]   aren't.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.200]   He's done it.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:06.560]   But then I think given the Tesla three enormous demand for the Tesla three, that's not really
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.560]   going to work.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.320]   You've got to go to China to actually get something knocked up quickly.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.760]   Well, and also import tax for China.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.440]   There's a lot of issues around that.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.720]   And I think just making some products local makes more sense than putting on a big huge
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.920]   carbon massive electric car market.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.320]   They have to get into electric cars, although as they're all going to churn.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   You know what?
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   If you can do what?
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   Here's my feeling on Elon and the companies.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.840]   If watching him do what he's done over the last couple of years, I think he's got a
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:39.640]   couple of things up his sleeves about how to deploy this financially that could be very
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:46.440]   accruative to the bottom line, a creative to the bottom line and could make it even better
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.880]   and more attractive deal for a large portion of people.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.080]   So if you just think about people who go into the store who are buying an EV, they've
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.120]   already bought into these 400,000 people who are buying it and the 100,000 people who
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.080]   have bought the other cars, half million people, they have money and they buy into this vision
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.840]   of the future, which means the checkbox of put a power wall in the checkbox of put a
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.520]   solar on, I think that's like at least half of them will do it.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520]   Maybe more.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520]   We did it.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520]   We did it.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.720]   And it wasn't all tied together.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.760]   Was I had to make three separate calls.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.160]   Any California owner of a Tesla would buy a power.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.160]   Makes sense here.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   Look at all the sun.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160]   Yeah, from Earth.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.160]   It makes the sun shine.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.160]   We've got the earthquakes.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.160]   It makes sense.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.160]   Oops.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.760]   Can I take it to New Zealand is the question?
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.960]   These students talking about banning the sale of petrol cow.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.960]   No, we did it.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.960]   Norway's already done.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960]   I've already said 2025.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.960]   Something like that.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.960]   That's the way it's going.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:46.960]   You know, it's an amazing thing to say that we're going to ban petrol vehicles.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:47.960]   Like they won't be.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:48.960]   They have.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   Well, they're going to ban the sale of them.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:50.960]   They're going to ban the travel.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.960]   Oh, and it'll be a phase out.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   It'll be a phase out.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   It'll be a phase out.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.960]   It's a phase out.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.360]   Well, truck automations happening right now.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.360]   It's really interesting.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.360]   It's way ahead of truck, right?
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.720]   I don't see why not.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.360]   I mean, you need to have more power.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.520]   Yeah, more power packs.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.000]   But that's going to be a very interesting one is when they get these dialed in that
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.600]   you're going to have these convoys of trucks, you know, that just automatically, you know,
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.000]   go in a convoy on the road.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   It's going to be pretty interesting.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.880]   What's interesting also is I think Tesla's on a course to maybe you'll be able to buy
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.160]   the car based on how many miles you use and it will automatically come to you.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:32.120]   So that's that, you know, have your car come out of the driveway.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.920]   There's no reason at some point you couldn't collect that button and have a car come to
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.920]   you from a central garage.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.920]   No, it's a.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920]   You take the garage from the day.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.920]   You want to set it across the country or across the country.
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.600]   So imagine that vision where you don't own a car.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:47.200]   You just in the test lab say, I need a car for you buy a thousand miles a year from Tesla.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.440]   For a dollar a mile.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.440]   And you're done.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.480]   It also means if this actually gets in and we can get these kind of cars working on the
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:00.040]   on US roads or roads worldwide, coming back to Uber, it makes them an instant cash cow
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.200]   because you can get rid of all that pesky driver business.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.160]   And actually just focus on the software that you've got running the entire thing.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:12.280]   I put that at over I put the over under on the majority of miles in a city being driven
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.080]   autonomously at 12 years.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.080]   Hmm.
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.080]   That seems fair.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.080]   I don't know if you take the over to the under on that, Ian.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.400]   I put a few miles in a major US city being autonomous.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.400]   Okay.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.880]   I think I think we're twelve or a great thing.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.000]   Well, technically it will be possible in under 12 without a doubt.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   Okay.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   Let's pass by.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   Legalization.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   Regulation.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   That's going to be absolute key.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   Regulation and acceptance.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   Acceptance regulation.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.640]   You're talking about taking this comes back to what we were saying earlier.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.320]   If that comes through, you're talking about taking truck drivers, bus drivers, taxi drivers,
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.720]   delivery drivers, all off the road.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.720]   Stay home.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.720]   Their jobs are gone.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.440]   In a way, one and a half percent of the entire American population is employed as drivers.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.520]   That's a significant number of people in the chat room.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.920]   Would you take under 12 or over 12 over the majority of miles take over or under majority
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.240]   of miles in a city being autonomous being legally autonomous?
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.840]   I'm going to go over over that.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.840]   Over.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.840]   That's going to lose that.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   They could lose that.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840]   Get a lot of over.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.840]   They don't lose that.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840]   They drive over that.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.440]   If we set it, one person says under, if we set it at 15, would you say over 15 or under
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.440]   15 for the majority of us?
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.360]   Because this is how the sports lines are set.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.360]   And that's where...
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.560]   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the very moment.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.560]   It's going to be heavy.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.560]   It's going to come.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:34.600]   It all depends on whether or not the politicians have the balls to pulse the legislation.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.840]   Dr. Moms, echo alarm has been going on for two minutes.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.320]   I think I better take a break right now.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   Okay.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.320]   Sorry about that, Dr. Moms.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.320]   Alexis, stop.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.680]   See if that helps.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.080]   Our show today brought to you by Trunk Club.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.080]   You know about Trunk Club?
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.680]   Trunk Club is really cool.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.480]   I think you need Trunk Club because...
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.800]   Is it subscription service?
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.280]   No, it's not, actually.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.600]   I just want to say, you wear the same vest every time I see you.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.600]   I do.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.600]   It's uniform.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.600]   It's your uniform.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.600]   Oh, uniform.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.600]   Now, maybe you're such a big shot.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.600]   It doesn't matter what you wear.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.160]   But some of us, we want to dress for success.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.640]   We're dressed for the job we want.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.640]   Yes.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   Not the job we got.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   Trunk Club is cool.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   Now, you said subscription.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.000]   I think that's the first thing people assume, "Oh, I'm going to get a box every month."
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   No.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   That's really cool.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.200]   And there is no cost to you up front.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.560]   Here's how it works.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.440]   With Trunk Club, you go to trunkclub.com/tuit and you sign up.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.720]   This is free.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.520]   And you will never go into a store to do your shopping.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.480]   You're going to get your very own personal stylist for free.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.560]   She will call you.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.560]   You will talk.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.560]   And I had a nice conversation.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.800]   I'm not telling you her name because I don't want to steal her.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.800]   And she...
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.360]   I told her I'm a little portly.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.800]   A lot portly.
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.640]   I told her I was blunt.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640]   I was honest.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.640]   I told her.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.640]   Candid.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.640]   If you will.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.120]   And she was not mean.
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.120]   She did not laugh.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.120]   No judgements.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:55.520]   When I said stocky, she said, "Okay."
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.520]   And...
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.520]   A little back-and-thug.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.160]   I got some ideas.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.240]   They put them up on a website.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240]   I said, "Yay or nay."
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.160]   And then they sent me the Trunk.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160]   Wow.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.160]   Wow.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.000]   Full of really nice premium clothes.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.120]   She picked them all.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.400]   It's better than grandimals, but they all went together in nice shoes, ties, swim tro...
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.400]   Beautiful swim trunks.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.600]   I got some nice swim trunks, short-sleeved button downs, lightweight blazers.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.280]   Then, you still pay nothing, by the way, at this point.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.840]   Then you pick what you want and you send the trunk back with everything you don't want.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.960]   And then and only then you pay just for the clothes you keep.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.640]   If you keep nothing, you pay nothing zero.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.600]   And it doesn't mean you're going to get another box next month.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.880]   It is not a subscription.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.160]   This is from Nordstrom.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:40.040]   So you know you're getting really high quality clothing.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.240]   Really great stylists.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.360]   They have the highest standards in customer service.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:49.520]   If you live in Dallas or New York or LA or Chicago or DC, they have trunk club club houses
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.840]   and your stylist is there.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.040]   You can work with them and talk to them and meet them in person and even try on clothes
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.040]   there.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.440]   The nice thing is when you're trunk arrives, you have 10 days to try on the clothes to
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.800]   keep what you want, send back what you don't.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.520]   It's not a subscription service.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.480]   Shipping is always free.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.520]   You only pay for the clothes you keep.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.520]   That's it.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.520]   Super easy.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.520]   Oh, easy to feel.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.520]   So great.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.520]   I'm not a big shopper.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520]   They have it for men and women.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.520]   I am not a big shopper.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.520]   They send it back.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:15.800]   No, everything is free.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.920]   If you send it all back, there's no risk.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.440]   Make a statement at the next big event on your calendar.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:27.800]   Don't wear a puffy vest.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.800]   Get a look at it.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:29.800]   Out close in, Leo, please.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:30.800]   No, no, no.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.800]   I love your puffy vest.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.800]   That's you.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.800]   It's you.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.800]   It's you.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:35.800]   Keep it on.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:36.800]   Keep it on.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.800]   It reminds me of that thing they sell for dogs so that they can handle thunderstorms.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.720]   It's like it swaddles them.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.240]   You're swaddled in your puffy vest.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.680]   I'm just going to move slightly away from the black trunk.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.160]   Oh, now we drunk love truck.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:54.600]   Get started today at trunklub.com/twittrunkclub.com/twit.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.600]   They are really helping trunklub.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.400]   I have a lot of trunklub clothes.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.280]   I've been very, very, very happy.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.840]   They call that the thundershirt.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   The dog.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.640]   What's nice about it is going, you know, going, some people like to go shopping.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.240]   And most folks hate it.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.120]   And I think guys, particularly, I mean, I don't.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.000]   I'm going to, I think I beg to differ.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   Everybody loves to shop.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.280]   It's just what they're shopping for.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.960]   So most guys do not like to shop.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.480]   I do know guys that love to shop for clothes.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.640]   Most guys, shop for clothes not high on the list.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.880]   Take me to a hardware store or a pin shop or a watch shop.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.880]   That's true.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.880]   That's true.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.880]   We love, there's certain things we love to shop for.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:29.880]   Clothes are not one of them.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.440]   In my case, it ain't clothes.
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:35.920]   No, when it comes to the Christmas shopping, I map out what I need to get everyone, where
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.600]   the stores are, the shortest route between them and get it just done in one fair place.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.240]   That's what we need at trunklub for Christmas.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.240]   That'd be great.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.720]   Oh my God, that'd be great.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.000]   You talk to a stylist, she says, "Who's your list?
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.040]   This is a personal assistant is what it is."
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:52.560]   So I got a, you know, a same lesson.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.560]   Love Sam.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.560]   Nice guy.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.560]   Smart.
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.560]   He started Drop.io.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.120]   Then went to Facebook, did the timeline for Facebook.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.640]   He's created a personal assistant called Finn.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.080]   150 bucks a month.
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.080]   And then...
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.080]   Finn is in Finnish.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.360]   Finn is in, I don't know, maybe.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:14.840]   And then 35 bucks, if it's a tough job, up to, like, you pay an hourly rate.
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.680]   Because I think there's people on the other end.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.680]   iPhone only.
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.760]   I'm thinking I might cancel.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.760]   I never use it.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.760]   I never use it.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.760]   Well, what do you...
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.240]   What kind of stuff do you ask them?
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.240]   You could do all sorts of things.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.720]   I mean, like weird things.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:34.000]   Like, can you find out for me how many people under 15 voted for Brexit?
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.640]   You know that the voting age is Scotland is 16?
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:37.640]   Yeah, I know.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.640]   What is that all about?
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.520]   Well, it was done originally for Scottish Independence vote because they figured the
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.520]   young people would vote more for independence.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.520]   Okay.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.520]   But see, I learned that from Finn.
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.720]   I said, "What's the voting age in Scotland?"
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.720]   And Finn...
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.280]   Now, if it's hard, they'll charge you extra.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.120]   So I don't like this because I don't know how much it's gonna...
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.120]   We have a Google for this?
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.120]   You know, I mean, cool me, Mr. Pink.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.120]   But I'll do things like...
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.840]   They'll say, like, "Can you ask my friend Jason if he's available for lunch on Thursday?"
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.160]   And somebody will call you.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.600]   It's not all automated.
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.360]   There's another company called Operator doing something similar where you...
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.560]   Facebook M is similar to that.
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.280]   The idea is people like the chat interface.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.760]   And there's a whole caliber of companies which are called the mom companies for millennials.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.720]   And the concept is whatever your mom did for you, like...
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.920]   Oh, it's your mom.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:28.640]   So like, mom drove you to your appointment.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.640]   Mom got your clothes.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.640]   How much would you pay?
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.200]   Mom got you your food.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.080]   Not having to have a lease.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.520]   All these things that, like, take work and detail.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:43.240]   If you can have a millennial, never grow up and have to get a car lease or a sign lease
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:46.200]   for a home, they can go to WeWork and WeWork now has apartments.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.720]   And you just show up at WeWork, give them your credit card, you have an apartment.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.200]   In the old days, we just get a wife.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.960]   Women, damn them, they got wised up.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960]   You like the big, dangerous, young people.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.960]   It's a little stuck in the world.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.960]   It's like, "No, I'm not kidding.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.480]   I mean, you know, that's what happened as a guy got a wife."
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.960]   And then she did all that work.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.720]   You basically, she took over for mom.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   No, I know.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.600]   And then they wised up and they said, "I'm not doing that.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.600]   What are you crazy?
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600]   I need a mom."
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.320]   You should see the punch, "That's my wife gives me."
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.320]   I got it.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.320]   It's like opposite.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.320]   It's like, "Here's the things you're doing this week."
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.320]   "I need you."
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   "I'm like, "I need you."
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.320]   "Okay."
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.320]   But he's sexist, right?
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.320]   Because I bet you're the one that just manly things, like, you know, to hang up things
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.320]   at all.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.320]   There's an interesting thing.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.760]   You know, when you look at the assistants that were made, Alexa...
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   All women.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:30.720]   It's all women, Siri.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:36.760]   And so there is a little something there where I think we have to think on a society what
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:39.080]   we're going to call all these assistants.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.720]   I think one of the reasons based on the people I've talked to...
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.720]   Mommy is a good name.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.560]   That they went for.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.040]   One of the reasons they went for female voices is because the people psychologically reacts
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.320]   better to female voices than they do to male voice.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:55.920]   They've always said that the heads up displays in fighter jets.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.960]   The voice that tells you, "Pull up, pull up, pull up if you're in a dive because you've
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:05.320]   passed out," is always a female voice for that exact reason that men, particularly, but
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:09.480]   I think anybody will respond better to a female voice.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.480]   That's interesting.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.480]   That's a human factor.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.120]   You see, I mean, when it comes to sort of...
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.440]   I was talking about this with a friend because, you know, the term by turn directions on your
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.360]   phone, it's always a woman's voice.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   And she was...
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360]   Not mine.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.360]   I have Arnold Schwartz in there.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.360]   Yeah, me too.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.360]   Really.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.360]   I won't bury my dead mind.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360]   Turn left.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   No.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360]   For why I had gladdars.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.360]   I was looking in the road.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.360]   And then they had C-3PO.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:35.160]   Well, there used to be a John Cleese Easter egg in one of them, where, if you spend like
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:39.760]   15 minutes going against advice, John Cleese will come on and go, "Are you even listening
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.760]   to me?"
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.560]   I don't want that.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.560]   There's a tremendous celebrity...
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.560]   There's a huge opportunity.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.560]   ...in celebrities doing your...
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.560]   Tom Tom used to do that.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.560]   They'd have celebrity voices.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.560]   But then nobody used to...
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.560]   Wait.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.560]   Now, Waze uses it like every couple of months...
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.560]   Waze does it promotionally.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.560]   It's promotionally.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.560]   But it was for...
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.560]   It was for...
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.560]   ...when Star Trek...
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.560]   It's Terminator C-3PO.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.560]   They were all free to promote the movies, right?
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.560]   Okay.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:06.560]   I had on my Tom Tom, I had a gladdars from Portal.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.560]   She's the evil computer.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.560]   This was a very bad idea, because every time...
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.960]   You were supposed to turn right, she would tell you, "Turn left."
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.400]   I kid you not.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.400]   This was dangerous.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.880]   Now drive off the pier.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.120]   Exactly.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120]   But it was a terrible...
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   You're a scum.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.120]   I love the XKCD.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:29.000]   I love the XKCD idea of the warmer, colder navigation thing.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.840]   You drive it on, it's like, "Colder, colder."
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:31.840]   All right.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.840]   So that's good.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:33.840]   "Warmer, warmer."
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:35.480]   That's a way to find it.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.480]   All right, Apple.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.480]   Now, this is rumor.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:42.080]   And I hate to do rumors, except we are getting closer to the time that they're going to have
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.080]   to manufacture.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.080]   We may even be at that time.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.600]   They're going to start manufacturing the next generation iPhone.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.440]   They will typically announce in September for an October release.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.880]   If you're going to make 100 million of them by the end of the year, you better start
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.880]   now.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.880]   Better be good.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.760]   Well, I'm just on a corporate basis.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.680]   People are not upgrading their phones.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.960]   They got to come up with something transformative, more than emojis.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.520]   Well, here's more than dumping that phone, Jack.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520]   Well, that's what's interesting.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.520]   Oh, I think it's furious.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:13.160]   We've seen leaks because once you start making these things, you can keep a tight lid in
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.160]   Cupertino.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:16.000]   But once it gets to China, all bets are off.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.760]   You don't have Steve Jobs policing it anymore.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.760]   That's the other thing.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:19.760]   I think that is a...
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.640]   The fear of Steve was like a lot of people were like, "I'm not printing that rumor.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.640]   I'm not getting invited to WWCC."
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.680]   Yeah, you don't kick down that way if you cross Steve.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.680]   Yes.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.680]   Really, they don't happen.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:29.680]   You won't get invited.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.680]   They're disinvited.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.680]   Oh, to W2...
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.680]   Are you kidding?
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:34.680]   You've been disinvited?
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.680]   Oh, I haven't been invited for years.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:37.680]   I was going to say, we've been on a blast for about...
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.680]   Six years?
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.160]   I've been on a blacklist for six years.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.480]   We beat you about four.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.480]   Really?
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.480]   But yeah.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:44.480]   Register has been on the list.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.480]   Oh, we've been completely blightless to my app.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.480]   Even Gizmodo got invited back.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.480]   They're still...
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.480]   Wow.
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.480]   I got engaged and invited back.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.480]   Well, I guess...
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.480]   After I...
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.120]   Yeah, but it was Gizmodo that bought the phone.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.120]   Well, that's...
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.120]   Yeah, that was bad.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:02.080]   But I had to email Steve because the Engagic guys got banned because we did Intenigate.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080]   We didn't come up with the name Intenigate.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:08.880]   One of the commenters did, but we made a phone headline like Intenigate, iPhone 4,
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.760]   and Steve was so upset by this.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.520]   This seems so wrong to me.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.520]   Well, you know, Steve...
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.520]   You were so thin-skinned.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.920]   Well, not even thin-skinned.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.920]   What do you mean?
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.080]   You're saying this not to that journal.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080]   You're not just saying it to Engagic.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.080]   You're saying it to their readers.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.800]   You're saying it to your potential customers.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.800]   You're not invited.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:28.800]   Right.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.840]   And I feel like that that is...
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:35.200]   Well, it's the same thing as Mr. Trump saying to The Washington Post, "You can't have reporters
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.200]   in my events anymore."
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:37.200]   It's anti-American.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.480]   It feels wrong to me, something.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480]   Anti-repress, anti-American.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.480]   For sure.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.480]   It's...
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.480]   But of course, it's petty too.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.480]   It's an increasingly common time-take though.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.200]   And the bell move out is how Beltway Journal is about horses, right?
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.200]   Well, don't Beltway.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.680]   Silicon Valley Journalism as well.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.680]   You say the wrong...
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.400]   Silicon Valley Journal is the wrong company, then you will get your insight.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:56.400]   So it's not just getting back.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.280]   Well, forget about not getting access.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.200]   How about not getting people to come give a keynote at your conference and then other
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.520]   people getting them for your keynote?
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.400]   So if you think about the decalference or reco...
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.400]   The recent maybe conference.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.120]   Well, look at reco.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.120]   Everybody goes to reco.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.120]   Well, it's very cluby.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.120]   I'm the friend who wants...
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.120]   Is that 'cause Walt will never say anything bad?
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.600]   No, Walt will say bad things.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.400]   Carol will say bad things.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.400]   No.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.240]   He'll say bad things about some people.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.760]   There's a way in which you go about it.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.760]   Like you can't...
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.240]   You can't be super sharp.
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.240]   You have to be...
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.240]   There's a way...
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.240]   Gentle, gentle criticism.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.240]   Yeah, there's a way of...
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.240]   Which Walt is very good at that.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.280]   'Cause Walt's very positive at Apple, but everybody points out.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.880]   He says, "Well, no, no, no.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.640]   I don't have any special treatment from Apple.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.640]   I'll say negative things.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.600]   Look, I didn't like the trackpad on the mouse.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.560]   I thought it was not as good as it could be.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:52.200]   This is a guy who managed to do an entire IOS 6 review and never once mentioned the fact
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.600]   that the maps app was absolutely useless.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:55.840]   So you have to do it.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:56.840]   You have to do it.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:57.840]   Maintaining access is important.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.600]   This is why I take it as a great point of pride that I get invited to.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.600]   No, no, no, no.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.600]   I'm saying to me.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.600]   No, no, no.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.600]   But here's the thing.
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.280]   If you look at Theranos, putting this aside, it took a Wall Street Journal writer in Brooklyn,
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.360]   John Carrey, who should have gotten a Pulitzer for this and I hope they correct that because
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.520]   it's just tremendous journalism.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:17.320]   It couldn't happen here because the other thing is...
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.320]   So it can valley access.
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.320]   If you look at even...
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.160]   Listen, I'm here and I'm massively conflicted as an angel investor.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.520]   People know my conflict so they can take my words.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.520]   You were honest about them.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.520]   Yeah, I'm upfront with it.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.520]   But there's other people and I recently had this on my podcast where I brought up some
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.200]   conflict somebody had and it was like, "Oh my God, you were being a bully to this other
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.200]   journalist."
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.640]   I was like, "Well, here's the thing.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.160]   You have to state what your conflicts are right up front.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.560]   If your spouse works at Google or Facebook or Twitter...
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:44.560]   As Kariswishers did.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.240]   Or Kariswishers did or Jessica Lesens does."
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.840]   It's just one of those complications that we have to be more honest about.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.680]   If you live here, the problem with it is if you live here, your chances of winding up
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.000]   married to a tech person is 98%.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.920]   If you live in New York and you work for the New York Times, your chances of marrying
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:06.800]   a Wall Street person is 6%.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.360]   We just have this inherent conflict.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.840]   Then, if you marry a person who works for a tech company or the person you're married
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.640]   to as a journalist winds up going to work for a tech company, which could also happen,
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:21.560]   then all of a sudden your net worth could be based upon that.
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.400]   It's just very problematic here.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.640]   I don't think you have a sharp, since like upside and red herring and those kind of like...
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.920]   Those were the days.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.680]   Those were like very edgy...
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.680]   Tony Perkins, right here.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.320]   You know, Tony was like a jerk and he was like his redeeming quality.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:36.680]   He was a jerk and that was good.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:38.960]   It was at the time and then he became a sellout.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.480]   He was kind of jerky to people in a good way.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.640]   It's like me, I'm jerky to people.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.080]   You're candid, I think.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.120]   You're a unique snowflake.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.680]   You know the way I do these sharp edges.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.160]   I don't even talk to them.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:54.320]   I don't want to talk to anybody, I don't want to talk to PR people.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.920]   And admittedly, I don't get as much kind of inside.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.920]   Look at your audience.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.560]   There's a real value.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.920]   It's too small for them to care.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.000]   No, the opposite.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.880]   Your audience, please they care.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:09.880]   Your audience is so loyal and so large because people know you're not in the pocket.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:10.880]   Exactly.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:11.880]   That is...
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.160]   I hope that's true.
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:17.600]   And that was actually one of the signature goals in my career.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.600]   Yeah, mission accomplished.
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.600]   No, I mean...
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.880]   And I did that by being a dick as much as possible.
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:22.880]   You know, we did it...
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.800]   Being candid, you know, you got to be candid.
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.240]   You got to have to build credibility.
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.440]   And that's why people look at like tech crunch as kind of a joke or...
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.840]   You know, they don't look at Waltz joke or Cara's a joke.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.320]   But there is a sense that...
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320]   It does.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.320]   And he totally...
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:38.240]   The companies that take investment money.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.760]   Yeah, the Mando lost all credibility.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.200]   Well, I mean, to be honest, tech crunch the same.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.840]   If you're writing about stories about companies that you are yourself investing in, I think...
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.200]   Haven't they transcended that though now?
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.200]   I mean, they're owned by...
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.200]   They're irrelevant.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.200]   Well, they might think they have the...
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.200]   They're irrelevant.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.200]   They're still in the...
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.200]   It's cheerleading the water, huh?
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.200]   Yeah, it's just...
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:55.200]   Here's the thing.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.080]   When Mike was there, he was a jerky publisher who would say anything.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.640]   But there was also this undertone of like...
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.640]   He was also investing it.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.240]   They were also invested in the pocket of things.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.440]   So it all comes out in the end.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:12.280]   You know, journalism is out of crossroads right now because you have the conflict of
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:13.280]   interests, right?
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:17.800]   CNN getting owned by a big media conglomerate, et cetera, Jeff Bezos owning Amazon.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.120]   You have this massive conflicted industry.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.120]   What's the most?
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.720]   At the same time, the business model is imploded.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.680]   So there's no room to pay for investigative journalists anymore.
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.240]   Their ranks have been totally slaughtered.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.400]   And we really need to think about freedom of the press.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:35.440]   And obviously the Peter Thiel, Gawker thing, no big winner there.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.280]   It was a lot of bad actors actually.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.640]   Yes, that's the problem.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.200]   It's a problem.
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:47.280]   We really need as a society to figure out where is the independent journalist core that
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:52.080]   is sharp and aggressive and protects society and gets us to the truth because the current
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.680]   press corps are largely failing at that.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:56.280]   Oh, I agree totally.
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:01.480]   No, no, seriously, when we get companies saying, we've had this with some of the biggest companies
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:05.760]   in the media who say, we're no longer going to cooperate with you because of that particular
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.080]   story that you did.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.080]   Well, fine.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:12.240]   You know, I mean, the readers don't pay us to write what you would like us to write.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:13.800]   The readers pay us what they want to do.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:14.800]   It seems like a very old fashioned.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.800]   Hey, come on.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:16.800]   I mean, Apple.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:22.240]   But this has always been a problem with trade press going back to high-fives and cars, which
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.640]   is to some degree, it was always press release journalism.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:28.680]   And it was an understood, if you read car and driver, you don't read it for their hard
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.040]   hitting analysis of whether a car is good.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.600]   It's really a fan scene for the industry.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:38.440]   And I think a lot of tech journalism far too much of it.
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.120]   But it's not a bad thing.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.680]   Well, okay, I'll give you a round.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:42.680]   It's a bad thing.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:47.120]   Back in the '90s, it was a good thing because people were so scared about technology.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.760]   They were so worried about it.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.760]   We needed a cheerleader like that.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:50.760]   We needed cheerleaders.
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.240]   But it's mainstream now.
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.800]   Now, we no longer the key to that.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:58.200]   You need people holding critical, you know, holding these people speak to the follow.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.800]   Well, here's a really good example, which is this Apple headphone jack.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.480]   Actually, we should take a break and then we'll come back.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:04.480]   Okay.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.440]   Because, you know, Neelai Patel wrote a great takedown.
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:09.880]   By the way, he was the one who also said that, "Here's five questions Kevin Kelly ought
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:12.360]   to have asked when he visited magically."
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.360]   That was Neelai also.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:18.200]   Neelai, I have to say Neelai of all of the guys out there, and of course, he worked for
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.080]   you in Engadget, right?
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:26.840]   Is willing to stick his neck out and say nasty ass things.
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.680]   And in this case, he says what Apple's doing or potentially doing with the headphone jack
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.680]   is criminal almost.
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:33.680]   It's anti-user.
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.640]   It's beautifully sharp after all.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.640]   And then wonderful article.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:39.080]   It's a competition, but that was a well worth the reading.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:43.800]   And then you see John Gruber, who writes during Fireball, which is probably one of the premier
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:48.760]   Apple blogs saying, "Well, you know, but Apple, they're brilliant this way.
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:51.240]   They discontinued the floppy drive and that was a good thing.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.560]   Anyway, we'll talk about that one.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:56.680]   Yeah, I could run for quite some time on that one.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.680]   This was a good week.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.680]   We had a lot of fun.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.680]   I wasn't here.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.680]   That's part of the reason.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.920]   And I'm as interested as you might be in this little mini video we've made of some of
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:07.080]   the highlights from this week's episode.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.080]   Take a look.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.080]   Previously.
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.080]   Onto it.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.080]   Now, how do I know you're doing it together?
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.080]   Because your green skills are so top notch.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:16.040]   Well, you will notice that we don't actually cross over here.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.640]   We have been really working on some of the key.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:21.680]   So this is the hardest part right there is to add that's a one key over top of the other
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.680]   one.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.680]   Security now.
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680]   You know what I can, Trustee?
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.520]   I can trust my home security cameras.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:32.360]   The title of this article on Reddit was I bought and returned a set of Wi-Fi connected
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:38.680]   home security cameras, forgot to delete my account, and I can now watch the new owner.
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:42.240]   You just plug them in and they don't ask any questions.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240]   Everything just works.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:48.720]   Oh, this week in Google, this two factor change that Google made.
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:49.720]   Is this an improvement?
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:50.720]   Does this make it easier?
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:51.720]   What do you think?
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.720]   Definitely.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.320]   Instead of having to look at a code, get an SMS, you get a push notification with a button.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.320]   Yes.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.640]   Authenticate me or no?
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.440]   I think I did something I should not have done you guys.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.360]   I was like, I'm going to go ahead and do this two factor thing.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:09.280]   The number I gave it was my Google voice number.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.280]   Oh, no.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:13.080]   My Google voice number is on the other side of the authentication.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.080]   Oh, Jason.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.280]   I think I'm screwed, you guys.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.640]   I think you might be.
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:19.640]   Yes.
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:20.640]   To it.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.760]   Jason's been locked out of the office because two factor won't let him back in.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.360]   That was genius.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:33.000]   Thanks to Jason Howell for taking over Twig for me and for Father Robert Ballis here for
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.160]   taking over security now.
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:38.760]   And of course Andy and Alex and Renee for doing Mac Break Weekly.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:44.400]   But I am back and we'll go back to the, I'm sorry, I'll be back for the shows next week.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.960]   Hey, Jason Howell is here from Tech News Today.
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.280]   What's coming up this week, Jason?
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.280]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.520]   It is a look at a few things.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.120]   We're going to be keeping an eye on in the week ahead.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:00.240]   First on Monday, June 27th, Snapchat launches its real life digital publication.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:05.160]   One new post every weekday on technology topics that are going to appeal to its users.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:11.160]   Also on Wednesday, June 29th, AMD is scheduled to release its price conscious entry into
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.600]   powering desktop VR, the Radeon RX 480 GPU.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.760]   That would be priced at around $200.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:23.320]   On June 30th, Apple is going to be pulling the plug on its iAd app network with the associated
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:25.520]   API scheduled to be deprecated.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:29.920]   This was initially announced back in January and developers are encouraged to remove the
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:35.880]   deprecated iAd framework classes from their apps by then as no more ads are going to be
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:36.880]   served.
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:41.000]   I promise there will be even more tech news all week, but I'm going to be out on vacation
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.720]   so you can find Mega Maroney bringing the tech news every Monday through Friday on Tech
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:46.720]   News Today.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:47.720]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:48.720]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.600]   Monday through Friday at 4pm Pacifics.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.600]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.600]   7pm Eastern Time 23th.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.600]   They're on Thursday.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:55.600]   Good to see you.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:56.600]   And you're a regular on that show.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.600]   I'll be there on Thursday.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:36:59.600]   I love it when you're on Thursday.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.600]   Always good fun.
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.600]   It was great.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.600]   Jason is spa.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.600]   A great ball.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.600]   A glass.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:06.600]   Is that what you said?
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.600]   Sorry.
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:09.600]   Mokimak.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:10.600]   Is it classy?
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:11.600]   Is she a lassie?
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:12.600]   Well, last thing everybody.
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.600]   Well, Leo logs into his audible.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.600]   I am logging.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.600]   Start the A-I-C-U.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.600]   I'm logging in.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.560]   Has an amazing service.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.560]   It's the Platinum service.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.760]   You get 20 credits a year.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.960]   Jason wants to do this.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.240]   I've done it for five years.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.160]   And currently, my pick of the week is Sapien.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:29.120]   It's a brief history of mankind.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.840]   Oh, this sounds good.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:31.840]   I am a mike.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:39.320]   It is 15 hours of incredible, incredible history of humans.
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:44.000]   And did you know that there were many humans on the planet concurrently, different species
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000]   of humans.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.240]   And the Neanderthal now is turning out not to be the failure that we all fought, but
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.600]   in fact, a very robust species.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.840]   Can this book is blowing my mind currently?
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.840]   I can't wait.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.240]   Over 4,600 ratings.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.680]   And that's how you pick a book on Audible.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.280]   You look at those ratings, 4.6 stars.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.720]   So a large number of ratings with a very high rating.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.000]   And what I do when you get that great platinum edition of...
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.800]   You get two books a month.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:13.800]   Which is nice.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.680]   And what you do is you're opportunistic.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:18.720]   You go right into a category where you feel like you need to beef up.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.200]   Like for me, it was science and technology.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:26.320]   And you just pick whatever five of the top 10 science books you think will make you smart.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.520]   And that's how I do it.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:28.680]   I just look at the rankings.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:30.080]   You browse Audible.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:31.360]   You look at the top rankings.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.040]   And then you just buy the books that have the highest rankings.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.520]   And that have the most reviews.
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.240]   And you will become smarter.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.480]   That is what a great tip.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.720]   And all your books are refundable.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:45.840]   If you don't like a book, is a money-back guarantee?
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:46.840]   Was that true?
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.840]   I didn't know that.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.840]   That is true.
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.840]   You know why?
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:50.840]   Because I've never turned in a book.
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:51.840]   Exactly.
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.840]   But no fear.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:53.840]   No fear.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.840]   This is the Kevin Kelly book where we were talking about his business.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:58.160]   He's going to be on on Monday on trying to unleash it.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.560]   It's really, really good.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.560]   Lots of stars on that.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.560]   Here's the deal.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.560]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.720]   You're going to sign up for the platinum account.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.800]   As Jason was saying, that's two books a month.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:11.760]   You also get the Daily Digest of the New York Times of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.600]   Pay nothing for the first 30 days.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.640]   Cancel in that time.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.640]   You're gone.
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:17.640]   You're free.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.800]   But you do get to keep the books.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.960]   So you're going to get those two books for freedom no matter what happens.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:22.480]   I don't think you're going to cancel.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.840]   Jason, you said five years.
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.360]   I've been an Audible member since 2016 years now.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.360]   Wow.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.520]   Back when they were not part of Amazon.
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.280]   They were just a little independent company.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.240]   But they've gotten so good.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.000]   I had the, what was it?
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.360]   They called it the auto or something.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:38.720]   They had a, it was before anybody had iPhones or iPods.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.720]   Yeah, it was a device.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.720]   It had its own device.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:43.720]   It was on my diamond Rio and it had it listened on all the time.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:45.320]   I'll tell you, they've really worked on it.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.000]   One of the things they've done is they've really worked on the app.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.360]   So it used to be that you had to like podcast and sync your phone.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.600]   No, it's wonderful.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:56.840]   It'll download, even if you're on your data plan, you know, it will download just enough
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.960]   for you to get started with a book.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.320]   So you could log in through the web app.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.800]   And so I keep myself logged in and Chrome.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.600]   So I will go in through the Chrome app by the book.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.360]   Then I double click and go over to my app and I stream it.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.760]   I download it and I just buy books by the half dozen.
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:18.440]   Well, the best, most economical way of course with an Audible subscription audible.com/twit2
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:19.800]   to get yours.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:20.800]   This is nice too.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.840]   They've added the capability and this is great if you're on a Chromebook or any device
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:28.400]   that doesn't have an audible app, which is very few because there's iOS, Android, Windows
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.960]   phone, Windows 10, but you can stream from the website.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:32.960]   Sure.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:33.960]   So you can listen.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:34.960]   I'm listening to this wonderful book.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:35.960]   Which one?
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.800]   My Life in France by Julia Child.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.800]   Oh, wow.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.800]   So what's so wonderful?
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.880]   Actually going to France on Airbnb.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:43.880]   That's why we're listening.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:44.880]   That's why we're listening.
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.880]   What?
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:46.880]   You can do that Airbnb in a place.
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.800]   Airbnb, they're going to France specifically just to hire out Julia Child's kitchen and
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.800]   food.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.800]   And it's fine.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.520]   You can get Julia Child's old house and queued out this.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.520]   This is so much fun.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.680]   And that's why we're listening to it.
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:02.680]   Lisa and I listen to this.
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:03.680]   This is another thing.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.680]   It's fun to think there are couples to do.
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:05.680]   Yep.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:06.680]   We listen together.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.600]   You know about the sleep timer?
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:12.200]   That's a brilliant thing is you can sleep time it in the app.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:13.440]   So you can say, I want to listen.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.520]   So I've been listening to sapiens and, you know, I have something.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.520]   I'm getting that by the way.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.520]   I have a hard time going to bed sometimes.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.040]   So I put it on 20 minutes.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.040]   Yep.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.880]   And then if I'm not asleep, I'll just go another 20 minutes.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:25.000]   But if I do fall asleep, I know I might have missed the last five minutes.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.200]   So I just rewind a little bit.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.200]   And I put myself to bed sometimes for the book.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.840]   Now by the way, it looks like they have the unabridged, but it looks like they might
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.520]   also have the abridged version.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.400]   Now, I'm not a big fan.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.720]   No, this is, it's just a, oh, this is like a analysis and review.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.920]   So this is like a companion version.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:44.920]   Wow.
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:45.920]   Okay.
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.520]   You know, they have the great courses now, which is I know I actually I listen a lot.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.720]   I have two of those right now.
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.720]   I'm listening to building a better vocabulary.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.720]   Oh, really?
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.560]   Which, you know, I don't think I have a weak vocabulary.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.560]   I'm curious.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:57.560]   I'm curious.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.560]   Well, is it making you more loquacious?
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.560]   I think the quote.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.760]   Let's not start a Donnie Brook.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:03.760]   I'm curious.
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.760]   Oh, over this.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:06.760]   This looks good.
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:07.760]   Oh, that's great.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:08.760]   And it's really good.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:09.760]   The guy is this guy.
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:10.760]   18 hours.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:11.920]   That's a lot of vocabulary.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:12.920]   Well, you know what?
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:13.920]   You go on a nice hike.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:18.360]   I like to do my hikes and I put it on for a hike and it's just nice to fill in.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:19.360]   You know, I love his fill in.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.800]   Well, that's because I was right at the end of the woods developed some of you.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:24.800]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:29.040]   I just bought very good old New Year's Eve because you can look at the etymology is the
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:30.280]   first use of a word.
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:31.280]   It's really fun.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:35.320]   Bill Bryson's done some great books on all the roots of language for that sort of thing.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:39.520]   Yeah, by the way, Bill Bryson, another great audible walk in the woods, which is his story
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.760]   of the walking the Appalachian Trail is so great.
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.320]   Yeah, maybe America.
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:46.320]   Oh, yes.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.560]   The most constant was the first one of his I read and it still has one of the finest opening
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.720]   lines of a 20th century book.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.720]   What was it?
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.400]   I was born in Des Moines, Iowa.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.240]   Somebody had to be very funny.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.560]   Is this the one you were talking about where he's talking about language?
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:01.560]   The mother tongue.
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.560]   Very good read.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.560]   Very, very.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.480]   So we've just given you about 30 books you're going to want on Audible.
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.480]   You get too free.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.480]   Go to audible.com/twit2 and God save you.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.320]   I haven't helped you because I don't know how you're going to choose.
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:16.000]   But the nice thing is another two books next month.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000]   Right.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.320]   I'm going to read my own book.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.680]   Are you writing a book?
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.680]   Just sold it.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:22.680]   What?
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.680]   Congratulations.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:24.680]   Yes.
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:25.680]   I'm a book dude.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:26.680]   It's a big deal.
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:28.680]   What is it?
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:31.920]   Did you get Gary Vaynerchuk money?
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.920]   More.
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:36.680]   I think I got more on my first book than he did.
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.680]   He got like a 12 book deal.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.680]   This is a count.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.440]   This is really don't do 12 at a time.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.720]   No, I'm only going to do one book in this lifetime.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.720]   What's it called?
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:50.400]   I can't say the name, but it's going to be about angel investing and how wealth is created
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:51.640]   in the 21st century.
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:53.400]   Oh, that's a must.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:57.480]   I wrote the first four or five chapters and the woman said.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.360]   Her business is very good.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.080]   It was the I had basically had an auction for it.
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.080]   Smart.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.080]   So they did an auction and.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.120]   This is why we're sitting here.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.880]   He's driving a Tesla.
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:09.880]   Well, you drive a Tesla as well.
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:12.280]   They are just trying to chum up with it.
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:13.280]   No, no, no.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.760]   I'm pretty quiet with my friends.
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.400]   I'll just say.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:20.760]   The best moment was they said we have Jim Collins.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:21.760]   Love him.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:22.760]   Peter Drucker.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.760]   Good to great.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.760]   And we need Jason talk.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.760]   And I said, wow.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.560]   That is the biggest line of because I've ever heard of.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.560]   That is a trio.
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:30.560]   That is a trio.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.560]   Like there's guys and giants.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:35.120]   I'm not going to hold the candle, but I'm pretty excited about it.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:37.440]   It's it's it's going to be a little bit.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:41.560]   If you could write a book, it has to be something you're an absolute expert on.
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.800]   You know better than anybody shouldn't be hard work.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:44.800]   It should be.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.240]   And you know what writing about angel of a semester, I'm just telling my story of how
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.000]   I invested in these companies and all the money I lost and the ones that were hits and
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000]   the ones that are in between.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000]   That was my problem.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.720]   I've written many books and I didn't know anything about what I was writing.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:58.040]   You should write a book on broadcasting.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.680]   You should write a book on broadcasting.
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:01.400]   I don't know anything about that either.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:04.680]   I just I just it's too much work for too little money, but I don't get the book on
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:05.680]   broadcasting.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:06.680]   It's actually amazing.
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:08.600]   What if if you just did a book on broadcasting?
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.600]   What I've learned.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:12.400]   Here's what I've learned in twenty five years for people who want to be broadcasting.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:13.400]   Twenty five years.
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:18.160]   December forty forty years for my forty years in broadcasting.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.560]   How to break into broadcasting.
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.560]   I'm forty years in broadcasting.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.560]   Back in the day.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.560]   If you want to be a great broadcasting.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:26.440]   You got to do the crank.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:27.440]   It's all about the tape.
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:30.880]   And make sure the antennas pointed in the right direction.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:31.880]   We.
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:32.880]   We.
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:33.880]   The first.
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:41.360]   The first microphone I ever used was a vintage RCA ribbon mic hanging from the ceiling.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.360]   Oh my word.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.360]   And it.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.360]   That's hilarious.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.360]   Oh my god.
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.360]   It looked just like this.
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.360]   This is it.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.360]   It was a beautiful.
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:50.800]   And did they have like fake shoes on the desk where they were like and they ultimately
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:51.800]   were playing.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:54.800]   I'm Leo.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:58.320]   And I'm here to tell you about this was it the RCA seventy seven.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.960]   Who is that the door?
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:00.960]   Great Mike.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:01.960]   Oh you could buy it on eBay.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:02.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:03.960]   I'll be back with you guys in a minute.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:05.960]   Had a break into broadcasting.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.960]   Well this thousand dollars.
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:08.960]   What.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.520]   That's unbelievable.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:15.040]   So these ribbon mics are very fragile because it's a carbon ribbon inside the microphone.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.040]   They break easily.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:17.040]   But why would love to have one?
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:19.160]   Well we know there used to be a stuff.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:22.200]   There is one of the archivists that Abbey Road and they have what?
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:23.760]   Yeah they have what?
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:28.560]   They have serious issues now because they have media which they can't you know they
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.560]   don't like.
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:30.840]   If they play a bag it'll shred.
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:36.760]   Well they want to know they've got the heads on the tape player to play the media back
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:39.840]   are so old and no longer made.
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:44.840]   They don't have enough head time to actually play the playing back and digitize them.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:48.200]   So now they're going to have to go to people and get them to custom build and make them
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.200]   new.
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:53.120]   And it's an enormous problem.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:55.720]   But are these Beatles recordings?
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:58.880]   There's a lot of Beatles recordings but everyone has recorded at Abbey Road.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:46:59.880]   Well of course.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:00.880]   But of course.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:01.880]   But just the Beatles recordings alone.
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:04.520]   There's stuff that we haven't heard is that what you're saying?
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:07.240]   There's stuff which actually to be honest you probably shouldn't hear because it's like
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:12.280]   you know it's not that best stuff but it is new stuff and people will buy it because
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:17.520]   it's the Beatles and you know you do but you know it's I mean there's an almost we are
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:21.800]   reaching well we're kind of going through a digital dark age at the moment where all
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:22.960]   the stuff that was going on here is.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:23.960]   No you're absolutely right.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:27.440]   Up until the sort of 80s and early 90s we're going to lose it.
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.600]   I was on a campaign for some years to talk I was talking to many of the broadcasters I
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:36.440]   knew who had great interviews with you know Jimmy Hendricks and others.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:39.720]   There's a guy in Toronto who's interviewed everybody it's on real to real tapes in his
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.240]   garage.
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:45.920]   And I said it's John Donoughby I said John you've got to let me help you.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:49.960]   We will get these tapes digitized because in a year or two they're going to fall apart
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:50.960]   and that's it.
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:54.880]   They did it for the movie industry and I will help you put this online you know.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:58.480]   Isn't there a case of that with the first ten of my Super Bowl where somebody has to
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:47:59.480]   record it.
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:00.480]   They don't have it.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.480]   There's one guy who has it.
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:02.480]   There's one guy who has it.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.480]   There's one guy who has it.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.480]   And they won't buy it from him.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:07.680]   Yeah that he's so tied up in legal problems that no one can ever see it.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:08.680]   Yeah I saw a clip of it.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:09.680]   It's kind of a chit.
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:15.120]   It's just just it's just guys throw your ball around a kicking it occasionally.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.120]   It's not a terrible.
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:18.280]   It's a fumbling the ball constantly.
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:21.240]   Well first of all we should be called football but that's the story.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.720]   But what do you need like go ahead.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:26.960]   Why would you say with this headphone thing are they simply removing the jack.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:27.960]   We don't know.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:31.720]   No let's say it's all rumor at this point but if they are removing it.
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.200]   Let's just assume that's true.
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:38.000]   It would be a lightning port by the way there's precedent for this motor roll is new Moto
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.640]   Z or Z and you're as your people say you know the guys invented the language.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.640]   Okay whatever.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:50.960]   It's a type C connector with no headphone jack and both type C and lightning are data connectors
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.840]   as well as charging ports so you can get digital audio out you would have to have a
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:01.880]   DAC a digital digital to analog converter either in a dongle or built into headphones
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.720]   that would plug into the lightning port.
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:07.160]   Apple does beats does make lightning port headphones.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.440]   Philips also makes lightning port headphones and the question is and it's unknown whether
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.360]   Apple would bundle a dongle.
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.560]   You can get anything out of my people pay through the notes.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:17.600]   They're going to make you pay $30 for a dongle.
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:22.760]   So Neelike Patel and Nick N. we should say this is a rumor although getting more credible
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:27.240]   as we get closer to the launch date taking the I love Neelike for saying this taking the
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:33.960]   headphone jack off phones is user hostile and stupid have some dignity.
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:42.520]   Well I mean is there motivation because they bought beats to make a royalty every time somebody
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:44.520]   makes headphones for unknown.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:49.440]   Apple would be really like you don't make that would show that Apple is so desperate
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:52.920]   to make more money that they have to like close the ecosystem anymore.
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:56.120]   What is the upside to not having it is what I'm trying to figure out.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:01.120]   That's the rub yeah is the upside that well you know they'll have some statement Johnny
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:07.160]   I will come on and said after really thinking about the purpose of a headphone jack.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:12.040]   We decided the best way to do it is to not do it at all.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:17.120]   What we've done is we've made the invisible headphone jack you've always wanted.
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:21.400]   Now you don't have to worry about mistaking your headphone jack for your lightning connector.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.440]   I can't just say these English accents are hilarious.
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:24.440]   I know they're right.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.440]   I know I'm sorry.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.760]   It's not good to make it thinner.
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:32.120]   You could argue that there'd be more room in the case a little bit for bad giving.
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:33.720]   Oh I give a millimeter.
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.720]   It simplifies it.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:39.400]   And of course Apple's always been about fewer buttons fewer controls fewer jacks they made
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:41.400]   the MacBook with one type C.
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.280]   Yeah and hasn't that paid bonuses for users.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:47.400]   The new MacBook uses a C USB C.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:50.480]   Does that mean the iPhone is going to move to a USB C?
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:52.880]   No Apple has said we will make it with a lightning port.
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:57.880]   In fact at this point if they do do this now they're really committed to the lightning
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:00.080]   port for many more years.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:03.080]   Because what the last thing you're going to do is next year make it a type C connector
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:08.600]   and say oh and by the way that perfect headphone you just bought doesn't work anymore.
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:11.120]   Yeah but we've got a dongle for the dongle.
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:17.440]   We need to double dongle the way this is a fill landfill with as a case in the cupidino
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:18.440]   idiot tax.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.280]   There are enough Apple sheep out there who will buy whatever they could get they get because
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:25.440]   they're told it's cool and yeah no this is great look I can save a whole millimetre
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:27.440]   for my phone it only cost me $30.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:30.120]   It's Apple and Dadly have a reason.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:33.920]   Now one thing Neelive brings up is digital rights management because of course said
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:40.320]   oh is an analog hole right and I don't think this is I can't imagine this is a problem
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:44.720]   for anybody in the industry but you could of course take copy protected music and record
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:49.480]   it but nobody's doing that because most music is no longer copy protected so I don't think
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:51.560]   that could be the reason.
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:52:00.720]   It is it may have a significant impact you know for I don't know podcasters I mean if
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:04.600]   there is no positive use case for why people should do this other than Apple is telling
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:09.080]   them that they should go check in with John Gruber famous Apple blogger.
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:12.960]   When you plug in just on a technical basis if I plug in my power cable I'm charging my
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:18.720]   phone yeah and I want to listen to audio sorry because wait that's a that's a major use
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:23.360]   case for me I'm plug my phone plug in I'm listening to a doc and you listen yeah I
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:26.400]   will you know when they put it on the bottom they kind of screwed that up anyway right
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:30.640]   but now would I but not would there be like a pass through because I have this with the
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:35.000]   SBC you have to buy a pass through yeah exactly where you like Daisy chain you have to buy
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:43.280]   a new doc as well yeah I just you know it's very apt to have no way John Gruber says look
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:48.800]   here we go look let's he says let's compare this to arguments about removing floppy drives
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:59.960]   in the iMac in 1998 something on your playlist it's my song it's my song
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:09.200]   love you you can you can you love to shape on that forest gate who is this that's a good
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:20.360]   rhyme it's it's always it's Broadway it's in the heights first first I prefer the death
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:26.160]   metal you're going to buy a new doc for your material
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:31.040]   now what you could do what you could do and I think one one thing people are speculating
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:34.880]   is now you're gonna see a plague of people walking around with their speakers blaring
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:40.720]   from their iPhone listening to music coming out of their iPhone yeah I know I don't be
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.220]   don't be that person at Starbucks like this no yeah no I'm at Starbucks yeah that's the
[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:51.580]   Kim Kardashian's no I you know I talked to him and I'm just like really the speaker phone
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:55.780]   buttons for when you're in your car not in line it's yeah well it's the same with the
[01:53:55.780 --> 01:54:00.520]   Apple Watch or smile watches just yeah no no no I'm oh I read it you're fine okay great
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:09.280]   well no no no no no no no I was only type one don't worry I mean you I'm a huge fan of
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:15.120]   Dick Tracy and I actually think this is cool yeah yeah it's it's you can't you can't do that
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:23.320]   with that one no the Fitbit doesn't know no no stupid watch stupid so okay so I guess
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:27.400]   we're all in agreement this is just well I just the real test it well I think it's gonna
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.560]   be an interesting test of how devoted people are to the Apple we go I think Apple was a
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:37.520]   WWDC made some very credible reasons for wanting to be all at all Apple all Mac iPhone
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:41.880]   Apple Watch they will all work together you'll be able to walk up to your Macintosh and your
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:47.960]   iPhone will unlock the the and so there's there's there's really buying into that ecosystem
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:59.800]   will the like some Washington Heights here we go to buy what's over Johnny I make the musical
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:10.760]   I don't know down the other side so I know I have no idea what it's talking about so it's
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:15.880]   a question of whether people will with this be enough I think I think I think Apple is
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:20.120]   going through a long ever since jobs died is going through a long experiment as to how
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:25.000]   badly they can screw their customer base and still keep them you know it's it's by increments
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.800]   how much what can we sell them as useless does some doesn't work they've lost that focus
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:36.120]   jobs and something something's you know that the there is this big question of you know
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:42.200]   post-heave jobs is the company gonna decline go sideways or go up yeah and people have been
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.880]   looking at it and it looked like with the iPhone 6 like okay yeah that they still got it most
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:51.880]   profitable company of all time right and then you start then you like oh the watch looks
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:56.600]   so promising and then the watch is not actually very good no and you're like okay now I got
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:01.960]   to check in that box then you look at the new iOS release and it's like the most interesting
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:08.280]   thing is emojis it's like hmm what's gonna come out that's gonna be transformative or interesting
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:14.840]   and all I see is more skews of the existing product basically iPad Pro is the problem to some degree
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:19.800]   that you can't do much with a new smartphone that will make it unique we've reached peak
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:28.120]   now taking a unique approach to say hey our newest feature is we're taking a feature out yes yeah
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:32.680]   I mean they'll make the case that the audio is going to be better because you have an external
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:39.000]   DAC you have a higher quality DAC if you ask most people is you're all good enough as it is most
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.760]   people from the companies been selling them those crappy white earbuds for oh god those things
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:47.160]   leak that leak sound like nothing else if you've got one of those irritating people on the on the
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:53.000]   bus or the trade who's got their little iBuds and there is a shattered everything with everyone else
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:58.760]   interesting statement invincible companies HP Sony compact all trash themselves doing exactly
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:02.520]   what happens it's a good argument not a good not a bad argument yeah i mean i don't i don't i'd
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:07.000]   i'd be em into there but uh yeah they sold their hardware business and then they're getting
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.600]   yeah they they got out when the getting's good and then califier and abortion in a way that's
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:17.240]   what HP's done haven't they they spun off the pc division yeah it's um they they the i think the
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:22.680]   issue is we've kind of reached peak iPhone and the iPhone was such a transcendent huge product that
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:28.120]   was so wildly profitable what could they add to the iPhone 7 is my question for you guys that would
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:33.800]   make you immediately buy it like is there something that you're missing or something that you can predict
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:39.000]   would make you go i have to have it no and that's where i think a lot of the smartphone companies
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:44.680]   are going to have a problem is does the Samsung s8 or 7 whatever comes next or the iPhone 7 or 8
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:48.760]   does it actually make you wait in line you know i remember i think vl is going to be very powerful
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:55.160]   that would be one only one i can think of i remember or magic leap or ar or some form of new
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:59.960]   magic leap into into into a smartphone can't see through it yeah i mean the big thing with
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:07.080]   one of the takeouts from got a camera so oh i see we've had augmented reality browsers on phones
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:11.080]   before we've got i mean but i mean one of the things from google i/o was they bring out this new
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:17.160]   range of vl ready phones which have up up to spec decent memory decent screen latency good screens
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.920]   all all the way they're going to cost of far out more than they're going to have to run android
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:25.960]   then whatever the calling back then but that could be a series as someone who's got you know the
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:31.720]   Samsung vl that could be a good reason to put on there's no question that uh android has spent
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:36.680]   this time catching up hmm i remember talking to Steve when he was on the beach when he was in between
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:43.480]   apple one and apple two he was working for pixar and nest uh next he ran pixar and started next
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:50.920]   um and he he was very clear and now because remember this is steve mad at being fired at apple
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:56.760]   but he said we had a lead against microsoft we had a ten-year lead when we came out with a
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:04.520]   macotage in 1984 we squandered that lead yeah and by 1994 windows had caught up and he was
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:08.600]   talking about windows 3-1-1 he was even talking about windows 9-5 he said windows had caught up
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:13.960]   and and he saw that as a clear and present danger for apple is apple today in the same
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:18.120]   position apples it's serious trouble at the moment when i say you can find something
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:25.400]   because these phones this is a htc uh i'm sorry uh one plus three four hundred dollars
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:31.320]   i would argue every bit is good in in every respect as an iphone looks in fact a lot like an iphone
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:35.400]   has a headphone jack i might add well and sound me and harway come into the market and actually
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:39.080]   start pushing into the u_s uh... considerably automatically plays show tunes
[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:45.080]   which is a selling point uh you do love you so i love my show tunes that there's nothing isn't
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:53.240]   better with a show tune uh funeral i've already made my playlist i've already made my play no i
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:56.840]   actually did because i don't know i was feeling depressed a couple of months ago you you made a
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:00.520]   playlist i made my funeral playlist well it's good to think about these things ahead of time
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:06.680]   actually uh i can say the wife and i have discussed the pre-break she is getting it is not on it it's
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:11.160]   sad songs i want people to cry at my funeral there's going to be a lot of fun
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:17.080]   i know what happens songs but one of them is rent uh the song about what five thousand seven
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:24.600]   hundred fifty minutes anyway uh i think you could you sing that i think that i should
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:30.200]   sure for sure lock it up lock it up dealie beloved we are gathered here today
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:36.680]   let's go crazy let's go crazy uh i would have loved highway to hell but i
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:40.840]   digress this is my sister you can't do a highway to hell you can't do it because this is for other
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:44.120]   media they're going to have in highway to hell no there's no waste always having a
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:49.880]   time like congratulations led Zeppelin they want one in court i think it's cool i think it's a long
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:56.520]   case going on for 50 years what was the deal this was a new case against uh led Zeppelin
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:01.720]   but brought by another band that i was really told with a great influence uh but
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:07.720]   it's just one tiny little riff is clearly inspired the rest of us has nothing to do with it yes
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:12.920]   exactly one little riff it's it's dates we're back to the api software pis the choice just
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:17.720]   what's going on with the monitor they just continue apple just continue the sentiment display so
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:23.240]   apple has said we're not going to make monitors anymore now there's a couple of possibilities
[02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:29.080]   one is that they have a new monitor and they're just selling out the stock that's one understanding
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:34.360]   well but that's not the understanding i get from apple's own statement did you read what apple said
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:40.760]   when uh let me see if i can find this um they basically said there's a lot of other people
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:45.400]   making great monitors just get one of those does that sound like a company that's selling
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:52.520]   that's bizarre they really said that because i literally was um tweeting to tim cook about this
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:59.560]   like i bought the mac pro with 4k you know the the cylinder and i had to for my video editing folks
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:04.440]   and i had to buy like aces monitors or lg 4k monitors to run with it because they don't
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:10.840]   make a 4k monitor then i bought the 5k i mac and the i mac then i had to wanted to get a second
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:15.320]   monitor i'm like am i supposed to buy a second i mac and use it as a pass through display or my
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:19.000]   so then i bought the widescreen lg it makes no sense here's what apple says we're discontinuing
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.760]   the apple thunderbolt display available through apple.com apple's retail stores apple authorized
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:28.040]   resellers while supplies last there are a number of great third party options available for mac
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:33.560]   users until we and then it don't have yet until we come out with something better here's what i
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:39.160]   think a monitor is a commodity apple doesn't even want to be in this business uh there are too
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:43.480]   many other people underselling them with great monitors i mean you can go to del and get a fantastic
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:50.520]   27 inch 34 inch display for less than apple cells it's undervolt display yeah so i think they and
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:54.680]   there's another reason they don't want to make computers that need monitors anymore
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:59.400]   they only make two right now the mac mini and the mac pro neither of which i can imagine are very
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:04.440]   good sellers the mac mini is not particularly where they want to know they sell the i mac they
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:09.800]   all make my max they'll make i mac monitors hi margin and one of the ways that the i mac
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:16.440]   5k works is because it is built into the system they can have a dedicated chip running that monitor
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:20.040]   dedicated gp amp yeah so it's my feeling that apple
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:26.840]   i think i don't want to be in this market i think it's a heifick it's a head fake because
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:32.840]   they've been you know they've been uh talking about this television service so i think they're
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.840]   out of the monitor they're going to make a tv well they've been talking about it for a long time
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:41.480]   and they haven't yet they by the way we should say they have not been talking about a long time
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.480]   well they've been negotiating with they have apple tv but they do want to buy they want to get
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:50.600]   cable and apple tv yeah content and there was somebody floated buying hbo at some point so they
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:55.640]   clearly know amazon's in the content business netflix is a home run the apple tv is getting
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:00.440]   more sophisticated has a more powerful processor in it i think they're going to make i still believe
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:04.200]   they're going to make an actual physical tv and i think that this is some sort of head fake and
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:10.760]   maybe they're just going to jump the fence and make an a k monitor or you know make a 5k monitor
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:15.480]   something truly transformative and they just don't want to tip their cards yeah it's a possibility
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:19.560]   i mean my my read of this was they will have a better monitor coming along in a couple of months
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:23.880]   clear the shelves out get certainly that would be the normal course of events it's just that
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:29.560]   weird thing about their planet third party money that statement is very oddly written yes
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:33.640]   because it doesn't say until we start making them or if that's the implication
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:39.320]   into another time it's like you can enjoy them while they're still in stock it seems like they're
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:46.840]   writing the end mmm you'll say you'd never have to say the i'm waiting for the stinger at the end
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:52.440]   after the credits yeah yeah we'll say you think morgan freeman's going to come on and say he's
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:56.360]   going to have an eyepatch and yeah something like i'm sorry i was saying real japan's yeah i was
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:01.000]   gonna say i'm gonna have an eyepatch and the monitors on no mother no no i think it'll be uh
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:07.240]   i think it's gonna be any i think they're gonna come out with the apple tv monitor with a gpu
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:12.760]   and it's something transformative and it's self-driving it's self-driving you're driving anyway yeah well
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:17.480]   comes to the right of like a hoverboard it's what is it a car with a tv in it well that's why
[02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:21.560]   everybody's doing well that's instant yeah but unfortunately come back to the you rules he can't
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:26.040]   have a car with a tv and it you can't no because it distracts from they can't anyone if the driver
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:33.480]   can see it okay now you have to drive on the left understandably i've been suffering from
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:40.440]   Brexit induced Tourette's for the rest of the show but oh okay you can't drive a car and watch the
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:48.120]   tv at the same time it's not doable without killing people okay small rad's done hold on let's take
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:52.440]   a break we're gonna have more okay Ian Thompson it's great to have you from the register.co.uk
[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:57.480]   it was fun always a pleasure love it did you bring your lovely wife uh she i think is in the back
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:03.800]   of the audience somewhere but uh if not then i will be calm so if you're here she didn't come
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:11.480]   here home say Brexit say Brexit she's sleeping she's finally getting a little sleep after that uh
[02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:18.040]   long week i'm gonna have to cycle home with this right okay she's also also she's out of here
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:27.000]   also with us Jason calicanis uh from calicanis.com and at Jason and do you want to say uh
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:32.520]   wait aren't you still doing that thing inside dr yeah so i got inside dot com we're doing email
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:38.440]   newsletters inverter it's a newsletter now yeah yeah what we found was nobody ever uses their news apps
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:42.280]   right um so you get we got over a quarter million people half million people to download it and then
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:46.280]   point five percent we use it every day it was like really brutal that's that that's straight out of
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:51.000]   that's good that's good that's good that's bad well if we spend more money we're gonna just burn
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.400]   through all cash we have so then we took the same people who registered we emailed the top
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:07:03.000]   like 10 percent they opened the email 40 50 percent like no email rate so it's the same content and now
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:08.120]   we're getting the same so then we did inside vr uh inside evs and we're doing inside security so
[02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:11.880]   we're just doing a series of newsletters twice a week go check out inside that's smart and you
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:18.440]   have pinpointed the topics that you yeah we'll do inside a hot ones yeah basically if you remember
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:23.960]   the trade show the trade magazine business i'm just gonna recreate that so i'll see you in email
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:29.480]   because 95 cents on every dollar we spend goes into the content oh that's beautiful there's no print
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:35.240]   there's no print and there's no um trucks apps so we were spending you put ads in it and we put
[02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:39.800]   ads in it exactly that's the revenue that's the revenue model just put an ad in it um but i'm just
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:45.320]   you know i don't need to run of evan rose doing he's doing a comical uh i know he's hodinky but he's
[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:50.440]   got no uh he's got a newsletter he does once a week once a month is that the same idea yeah i mean
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:55.240]   here's the thing about email there's some weird thing that occurred um one we figured out spam
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:59.880]   right like spam got solved yeah right don't feel spam like open your email box is not
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:05.960]   a game mail by the way yeah then all corporate communications kind of bounced out of your inbox
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:12.440]   because of hip chat and other services by Atlassian um great company uh i got your brother
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:20.920]   and then um you know uh social networks took all photos in private communication or a large
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:24.920]   percentage out of email so then email became all of a sudden like well this is the important stuff
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:31.640]   yeah and a great content delivery mechanism so um we're really leaning into it i think it's
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:36.600]   gonna work and it makes uh he's the journal dot email by the way yeah how do you get the dot email
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:40.520]   because i've been trying to get dot email i didn't know that was out yet i am apparently it's out
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:47.160]   for him really he must know somebody already yeah yeah it's uh but i guess it's the same idea um
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:51.640]   well if you and you build a community right yes you and here's the thing journalism we talk
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:56.040]   about journalism being broken what i love about the email model is journalists on most publications
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:01.240]   buzzfeeds business insiders whatever gocker they're trying to get people to click on social media
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:08.920]   so it drives the editorial in a certain very nasty disturbing very bad untrue very bad um way well
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:13.320]   particularly the research you saw to saw this week that of the articles forwarded on social media
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:17.560]   less than half of them are read of course right these people retweet they're like i like that sentiment
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:23.240]   boom i'm outraged but then with email what do you what is the writer's motivation to not have you
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:28.520]   unsubscribe or hit the reply key and tell you this is stupid or wrong right so when you think about
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:34.440]   journalist behavior at these other publications they're driven to do link bait at my publication
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:38.520]   and my publishing house they're driven to not have people unsubscribe which means they're driven to
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:46.360]   do high quality journalism again so i i'm i'm like um i'm like i got you know an old journalist publisher
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:52.520]   and i just want to like get one more swing at the bat and build one more great publishing house one
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:56.360]   more grading gadget oh how interesting one more great print magazine like silicon reporter where
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:02.760]   i get it right and journalism is saved and quality again i just i feel like i got one more swing at the
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:07.080]   bat and it doesn't mean i was a good medium but i think i think there's something there is a good
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:11.960]   medium so we'll see yeah i i'm just looking Kevin uh doesn't put ads in it i think it really is for
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:16.680]   him it's about building community right and he's got a podcast he's got a voice he wants people to
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:21.160]   understand what he's thinking yeah i have a voice yeah and not he doesn't have to link bait he doesn't
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:26.200]   have to trick you you're opted in there's no trickery ten reasons why apple is going down you
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:30.120]   won't believe number eight oh exactly just wait it's in every journal's mind is
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:35.640]   am i going to get fired for not getting enough traffic oh and in some publications they're actually
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:41.240]   putting targets for people and so the journal is a paying based on you know looking for a while
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:45.720]   yeah i mean look at Forbes where you actually get paid based on traffic based on traffic which is
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:51.240]   just a recipe for people just writing useless claim no wonder it's all crap it really explains it the
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:55.800]   more misleading the greater the chances you get your bones yes exactly funny thing is i'm i'm
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:11:01.320]   gonna do this later when i lose my voice hmm right because i don't i don't need a voice i have a voice
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:06.200]   will uh when i lose my voice i'll do we're building a leo leport ai we've never heard that i think
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:10.920]   it can happen i think we now have after 10 years after 40 years of broadcasting 10 years of twit
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:16.920]   we have enough clips enough sound enough sounds like the oleport example anything i actually am not
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:22.280]   completely joking you could i'm not completely joking i will leave that there's enough words
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:27.000]   with enough inflections and brought back to park they brought back to park they can bring back
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:33.880]   Leo it's my dream i want to be uh you can give the eulogy at your own funeral and that would be way i'd
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:42.200]   like to sing a song jolly beloved we're here today to bury me i just would like isn't that the plot of
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:48.520]   Prometheus and banny's at his own yeah by the way you could my cousin and my uncles i'd like to say
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:53.720]   a few you could literally just go through nothing like have your revenge at your funeral yeah now i
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:57.400]   go away we're all my friends it's called the reading of the will i think everybody does that
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:00.520]   you go through all the people who do you want to stand up and drop trowel these are
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:07.400]   i can see you watch in the box well look at this this is cool in the box it's actually a drinking
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:13.560]   glass there you go but before you get the drinking glass you might want to look at the automatic inside
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:17.800]   oh do you know about automatic right um now you can't use this with a tesla right yeah you can
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:24.120]   definitely every car is required to have one since 1999 now one of the things this does of
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:28.440]   course is tell you gas mileage how much you paid how much that i love this how much that trip cost
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:33.000]   where the car is when you're kids are driving where the car is so uh you know a lot of people i think
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.160]   they go to costco to get that giant bag of chips and say fifty eight cents but then the
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:41.720]   automatic system by the way the gas cost you about fifty now you know maybe that's not the best most
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:46.040]   economical way to do it right this is fascinating now i guess you wouldn't get gas mileage information
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:50.200]   on a tesla i'm glad to know i could take this to my tesla you could plug it in you all of them
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:56.200]   you have to have that on board diagnostic since 1996 every car in america has the obd two port you
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:00.680]   have it it's if you've never seen it you probably haven't because no one knows is it's in the dark
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:04.280]   underneath where your knees are underneath the steering wheel two seconds to install
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:09.000]   uh a plug it in you you put the app on your iphone or your android device
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.880]   you it uses bluetooth to bond i think it's bluetooth l-e it's very easy to pair it now all of a
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:18.680]   sudden you get an engine check light automatic tells you what it means in fact it will tell you
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:22.680]   not only what it means but with the nearest repair shop is which is awesome uh you keep track of
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:27.880]   your fuel mileage you can set custom low fuel warnings you can even ask your amazon echo how
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:32.920]   much gas is left in the tank now see i would like to do that with a test how much battery i guess i
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.480]   can do that with a test fit fit for your car it's fit fit for your car you get if you're you got a
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:43.720]   teen it will tell you what your teen's driving stats are on the android device automatic will
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:48.280]   set your android phone to do not disturb and disable the keyboard if you set it up you don't
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:51.800]   have to do this by the way but if you've got a teen driver you will want to do this i was thinking
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:56.680]   actually that i know of a similar system which is being used to buy a bloke to test his teen's
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:01.000]   technology ability this has this has if she can actually she can disassemble this and get around
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.640]   it without in finding out this has geo-fencing you know if you can set a geo-fence and say if
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:11.320]   the teen drives outside of this area i want an email i want a text message uh automatic of course
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:18.360]   has 24/7 crash response so that that makes you feel good too um the dashboard web app gives you
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:23.240]   all sorts of information lets you export trips but i'm using if this than that so every time i turn
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:28.120]   off the key in the ignition if this than that sends a summary including a map and gas mileage
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:32.680]   and everything of every trip to ever know so it's all i've got ever note notebooks for every trip i
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:37.880]   take uh it works with your nest so you can set it so that your nest turns on the heat when you arrive
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:43.080]   you are mechanic fresh books do you keep track of uh business mileage it will do that for you
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:48.440]   and fresh books are expensive if you lose your car you never lose your car and i actually know
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:53.160]   where you parked i have a disneyland feature i was i went somewhere i went out
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:56.280]   of town and i want to say where i was in a town i didn't know where i was
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:00.920]   i thought i was just looking around looking looing around and i went oh did i park where did i park
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:05.560]   yeah and i had no idea where i was launched the automatic app and it said you parked here and it
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:11.720]   even gave me a the the way to get home now normally it's 99 95 the software's free but when you use
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.200]   our and there's no monthly subscription by the way when you use our special offer code TWIT
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:21.080]   you're gonna save 20 percent i love this thing automatic.com/twit
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:26.840]   TWIT offer code saves you 20 percent it is fantastic and you think i might be joking
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:33.080]   but in fact when you take the automatic out of its specially designed packaging you actually do
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:39.320]   it fact yeah a travel cup i'm just saying i don't know if that's going to put you over the top if
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:43.800]   you're reluctant maybe you think and if you're there gosh if only i got a travel cup maybe i
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:52.440]   would buy that well you do automatic.com/twit don't forget the offer code to get
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:56.440]   this is of course a country where you can get a drive through margarita so can you
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:02.120]   apparently so in some states you can get drive through alcohol which is just crazy absolutely
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:10.200]   focused that's not true i hope so but actually we do about this if you if we do get self-driving
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:15.800]   cars in this lifetime then you will a lot of drunk drivers oh yeah drunk riders oh yeah absolutely
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:20.520]   well that's what it was for well i mean in la it did revitalize the nightlife because people in
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:26.520]   la would not drink because they were rightfully yeah concerned about you know exactly what do you
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:32.200]   think do you think this is a watershed moment c-span covering the the sit-in how is fascinating
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:38.520]   at the house yeah now c-spans doesn't own the cameras the congress owns the cameras and
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:43.880]   the rules are we turn off the cameras when we adjourn but the sit-in continued past adjournment
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:50.120]   cameras go off c-span cannot cover it however i want to say there's some members of the house
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:54.360]   that are technologically savvy but in fact they asked their staffers yeah and their staffers
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:58.440]   showed him how to use periscope person should we have to use this and yeah you guys are
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:03.800]   and uh facebook live and they broadcast periscope kind of went down but facebook live continued
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:10.280]   and c-span picked out about it picked it up and continued the broadcast brilliant wow yeah this is
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:16.440]   classic example of new technology subverting it's just amazing that um the gpu's and these
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:21.000]   phones have gotten so good and the lt e networks have gotten so good you can stream well i mean we
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.040]   used to spend a lot of money on equipment yeah so we could stream live in fact we streamed badly
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:33.080]   yeah it was crap before us sat you know do remember sala dan rather the 1968 convention with a backpack
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:39.560]   yeah you with a backpack it's off by some self-pilot we have made great strides and yeah now this is
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:44.680]   all you need to broadcast uh... every shot yeah i'm seeing more and more apps uh people i got
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:48.840]   pitched this week on two different apps that are basically using this as a studio where
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:53.960]   not only does it have obviously the bandwidth to do it properly but they have a teleprompter so you
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:58.280]   look at your phone's camera and it's running a teleprompter so you can do your news report and
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:03.800]   then it sends it up yeah and you can either do it live or you can send up the the stream and you have
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:07.560]   the teleprompter you have people asking you a question so this is going to become a thing where
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:11.240]   oh yeah you know news reporters are going to have this and they're just going to speak into it
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:15.880]   i've ordered this and i don't know why it's taking so long live stream is selling a camera for
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:21.400]   facebook live what's interesting about this camera it looks like a plain old web camera it's got a
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:28.920]   microarray mic not just a regular mic but it has a 4k sensor and so what you can do is split the
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:34.360]   4k up into four 1080p streams so you actually stream for this 1080p you're not going to stream
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:42.360]   4k but it has you can switch cameras in effect by pointing it with your you use your phone to aim
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:47.800]   it you touch where you want it to be but it also has face recognition so it will follow you so if
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:53.400]   you're walking around and so you're going to get a subset of the total stream that's interesting
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:57.800]   isn't that interesting yeah yeah these 3d cameras are going to be able to do it as well i was
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:03.640]   literally at my daughter's like little graduation step up ceremony and for the first time i saw
[02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:08.520]   like you know the robert scoble of the event like somebody with a stick and on the top of the stick
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:13.880]   was the 360 camera oh right and i just thought wow um now i'm having my picture taken without
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:19.080]   knowing it yeah that's what's really unusual and i was like i kind of like i don't really care
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:23.960]   but now i was just thinking like oh they're not even the camera at me but but i'm having a video
[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:29.640]   of me created the whole time i'm under surveillance yeah um at the thing so if i'm picking my nose
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:34.600]   or checking my phone or you're always on whatever you're now being recorded 24/7 because some
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:39.720]   dopes got this thing on a stick they used to have these cameras at the presidential debate the
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:47.720]   republic one of the republican debates and i i use my your VR to tune in to watch and they had many
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:53.000]   cameras but the one they started with was placed in the back and it was sitting next to a cameraman
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.680]   it was overlooking an audience was looking at the crowd i'm sitting here i'm watching the cameraman
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:02.200]   literally pick his nose do some gum because he he doesn't realize he has no idea he's i'm on camera
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:06.120]   i'm looking down here there's a guy sitting in the seat he's on his uh his phone and i can read what
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:11.880]   he's looking at on his phone yeah i think and you know you're being streamed nationwide yeah no idea
[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:16.440]   it's got lots of people having the crafty ball scratch or you know sort of the end of the armpit
[02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:19.800]   thing and i was gonna bring it up earlier it's very interesting
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:24.680]   it's a very interesting technique you have in well you know i can see it perfectly from here
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:29.480]   or rest the audience they have no idea that's an advanced technique only that came to the title of
[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:36.520]   the show i would die half please gemma this would be a good time to wrap things up there's so much more
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:43.560]   to talk about including the Rolls Royce remote controlled robo ships oh sorry paperware
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:51.960]   but uh let's let's table it for our next time and i welcome to hour three hour three yeah this
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:57.160]   was a lot of fun a lot of shows a lot of shows so much so much fun thank you well we did a kind of a
[02:20:57.160 --> 02:21:01.160]   little go off a script a little bit at the beginning i want to talk about back sprexet but
[02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:05.960]   we had he in and i thought it was great to have you in europe and you're no i appreciate it and
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:12.120]   for letting me get get my PTSD out the way you know and just we will deal with this we are stronger
[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:18.440]   than this yes yes we will fight them on the oceans we will fight them on the beaches all right my
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:22.600]   prediction you over here churchills follow up to that no because he gave this great speech we'll
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:25.640]   fight them we will fight them in the edge as you will never surrender never
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:29.480]   he sat down next to his home secretary in parliament and just as a side to him saying
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:32.920]   we'll fight him with broken bottles because that's all we're going to have left by the end of that
[02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:39.720]   yeah that's true okay it's from churchills so it's apocryphal he made up so much of his history
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:45.400]   that it was my prediction is they roll it back yeah i think it was just i think there's going to
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:51.400]   be some sort of like realization where the people who voted who were like i did i was doing a burn
[02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:55.000]   it down vote didn't realize it was going to get burnt down yeah they're going to repeal it
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:58.360]   the only way they can do that is for the hold a new general election which is going to be very
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:03.880]   difficult to do because they changed the rules in 2011 so they're in fact even though Cameron
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:07.720]   stepped down that that is not a call for an election he's just going to be replaced as the
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:11.800]   head of his party will be related replaced as the head of his party and then become prime minister
[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:16.760]   so the and under the rules of the course johnson which we mentioned which is wild
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:22.600]   guy that looks like you i can't say that now yeah here we are that's so but but couldn't
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:27.400]   couldn't parland call for an election okay election back in the day before they changed the rules in
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:32.440]   2011 they either the prime minister could say right we're calling election now go to the prowess
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:37.800]   and say excuse me madam could we hold an election or the majority of mps could vote to
[02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:43.000]   capacitive motion of no confidence yeah and dissolve parliament yeah however the rule change is now
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:48.600]   three quarters of mps have to have to vote on that or five years whichever comes first yeah all five
[02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:53.080]   years in which case you know the country might as well be burning down because five years from now
[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:56.440]   in the next election schedule so the same party is in power they're just going to pick a different
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:22:59.960]   head of the party they're going to be different head of the party see and if they went to a vote
[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:05.720]   of no confidence then it would probably fail because a nuff conservative MPs yeah would have to vote
[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:10.520]   against their own government and would then get deselected by their own local parties uh so
[02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:15.480]   i hope you're right i really hope you're right so this petition is kind of meaningless oh the
[02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:20.040]   petition is totally meaningless okay petition was i've heard i've seen a number of ports on this
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:25.000]   the petition was apparently started by a vote leave person before the election because he thought
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:29.320]   he was gonna lose because he thought he was gonna lose and then it garnered like 20 signatures or
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:33.000]   something and then after the election somebody saw this and thought oh that's a good idea i'll
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:38.280]   sign my name to this wow it's never gonna happen uh you know it's they will have to roll it back
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:42.840]   some way but strange things don't understand how they can do it under the current system strange
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:48.280]   days indeed i know you all want to go home and watch the season ending game of thrones that was
[02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:53.080]   last week that was the drop the microphone episode holy god the battle of the bastards i just don't
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:59.240]   understand how you kill kalisi's favorite after some nice florida oh i'm sorry hey nice get her
[02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:03.480]   jug i did it at the partner day so mean it's like how do you kill kalisi you can't get her
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:08.520]   she's one episode right everybody loves that character the problem is is completely believable
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:12.680]   oh of course they'll do anything kill anybody yeah if you think this ends well you have not been
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:18.200]   paying attention if you see the the the read up they've done of the battle with lirewe Jenkins
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:24.840]   july roe and july roe and you know what we got it it is just okay so spoiler alert amazing you know
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:30.280]   if you haven't seen last week's game of thrones to an out and out soon out but i think it would
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:35.000]   be appropriate to end with lee roe and i haven't seen it oh my god i haven't either i remember
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.080]   seeing it and i didn't watch it because i hadn't watched the uh you could literally watch the lirewe
