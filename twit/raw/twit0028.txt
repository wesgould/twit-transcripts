[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   This is Twit, this week in Tech, episode 28 for October 30th.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   No, I guess 31st Halloween, 2005.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   [Music]
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Our Halloween edition of Twit, nobody's in concert. I'm glad that Kurt Rodgers brought your gun with you.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Roger Chang from GameSpot Magazine will ask him what that thing is.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   It's actually Patrick Norton's racing shot for Chime Shot.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Why do you have Patrick Shot?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Because it just migrated that far.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   It's so cool, and Chime is really neat.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Like a BFG 9000?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   It does look like that.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Robert Herron is here from Digital Life TV in Ziff Davis, PC Magazine, also from Digital Life TV.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   The number one podcast in the nation on iTunes.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We'll feel on that last one.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   It's a good place to be.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Mr. Patrick Norton wearing a kilt.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   You are, he's wearing his umbrella.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Oh, sorry, a little too much information.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   We'll get him down.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Evan Rose, the first millionaire in the group is here.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   The first hundred thousand are in the group.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And also from System.org, Rev. 3, the Broken.org.com.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We've got Pronounce, all that stuff.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Big.com and all those places.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And also David Prager is here.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It was helping him become a millionaire.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Trying.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   We should start with that story.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I wanted to start with George Tk is gay, but really we should start with the fact that Kevin is now worth $2.8 million.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   No, no, I'm not.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Well, somebody is.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   The company is.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   The company in which Kevin owns majority shares
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   recently received in investment of $2.8 million.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So dig.com, the IgG.com got an investment from Mark Andreessen here on the guitar of eBay.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Who else?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Reid Hoffman from LinkedIn.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Are they all together or is it?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's all together in a series around.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And how much money did they give you?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   $2.8 million.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So you want to see the best part?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   So what kind of percentage did you have to give up in the company?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Not, I didn't give up any type of ownership, like controlling interest.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   You have controlling interest?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   So we still have control of everything.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   That was a big deal because the whole thing is we hit this kind of
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   growth rate where we're had to buy servers like every week.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And those kinds of servers are pretty pricey.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So Google AdSense does not cover the cost of $4,000 servers, especially when you're buying
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   like two or three weeks.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   So we just decided it's time to go out and raise some money.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And so we were lucky enough to get some really good folks behind us.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And we got enough to last for a while now.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   You're in a colo.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yes, we have.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   How many servers do you have?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Right now we have seven.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And your own Cisco switch?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   We have our own Cisco router.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   No, it's not Cisco.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It's a...
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Oh, I thought you were going to get a Cisco.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   We do have a 7,200 series, but I think we're doing, we're going to get rid of that one,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   though.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We're getting a new one.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   How much bandwidth do you use?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   A lot.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   A lot.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   That's amazing.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   The problem is we're doing about four million page views a day now.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Wow.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And it's pretty insane.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's one of those things where we're hitting like walls, like every week,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   or having to add more and more servers.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So...
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Is there pressure on you?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Right now it's tech.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And actually, it's kind of right now it's a certain kind of tech even.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   It's very distinguished kind of that G4 crowd is influencing it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Don't you think?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I mean, it's kind of...
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I'm saying there's a lot of slash.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I think it's the slash.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Really?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   You think it's more?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Initially, I mean, obviously...
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   There's a lot of case mods.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   When we first started, it was just, you know, obviously I pushed the side of my own side.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And like you've talked about it.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We've got the people that we know.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   You get the core group.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Yeah, the core group kind of got behind it.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Now, it's really cool because we're seeing like stories that have to do with us.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   They get reported and removed from the queue because people have no idea who we are.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   That's good.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So it's growing above and beyond that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   So it's a new base of users.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Are you going to go do other channels?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   You have kind of intimated that you might do that.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   That was part of the reason that we went after the money as well.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   We could have gone after a small amount just to get a few more servers and things like that
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   and kind of keep ahead of the growth.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   But we want to hire some developers as well to kind of push out new features.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   So that's one of the things that's been lacking on the side of the last couple of months.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   There's been so much time like optimizing queries to make sure that things are running fast
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   that we've had to cut back on developing new features.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So we need some really good PHP developers.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Like we're looking for some.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So if anybody out there is a PHP developer.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   So you know, who was it that said PHP is a bunk?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Probably Devorak.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Some big developer said, I don't know what they were pushing.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   But they thought PHP didn't scale very well.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Probably a Microsoft group maybe.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Yeah, I think it probably was.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Somebody doing ASP.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   In fact, I think you're right.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   It was somebody who put ASP over PHP.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   When you're building a new site, it's like it's either going to be a Pearl, it's going to be ASP, PHP.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   But Mark Andreessen likes PHP.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Oh, he does.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   That's what matters.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   He does indeed.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Right, Nick Jinks.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   That's right.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   He's a good guy.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   So it's scaling pretty well for you.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Yeah, it's actually where it's finally starting.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Part of the problem is when you build a site like that, you don't really, I mean, it was just going to be a project.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It was one of those things where the developer, my friend, Owen, he's like, "Oh, I've spent two weeks developing it
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and then I'll move on to something else."
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Right.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And so we really didn't initially write it to like scale to multiple machines.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   So now we're having to go back.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So you have to load balance on that.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Right, exactly.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   That's actually tricky.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So we're writing some of that code to make sure everything load balances properly and we're pretty much there.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   So it's going to take a few more weeks in some more boxes.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It's exciting.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Congratulations.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It's crazy.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   What does this mean for System and the Broken though?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Are you going to do less for that?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Well, those are stuff.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I mean, I still spend my weekends working on that kind of stuff.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It's like we do...
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It's got a day job now.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   That's right.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's got the 9 to 5.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   No, it's actually put more time into it than that.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yeah, we're actually signing a lease for some office space here in San Francisco.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Now, see, you should just get the old tech TV space.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   That's too big.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   It was awful too.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It was ugly.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yeah, it was going to.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It was a big check.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Well, it's probably something about the old TV.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah, I think it is still empty.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   It's still empty.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   No, they're putting...
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   We won't buy there.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   No, you didn't come with me, did you?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   No, I went with Dan and they're going to shoot car commercials in there and stuff.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   They're going to roll cars in because you don't have that back like...
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Yeah, there's a lot of room in there.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   We used to print cars in there.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Good place to put car commercials.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Okay.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So, what happened to George D'K?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   He came out?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Let me see if I can find the link here.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   We're talking about Sulu from Star Trek.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   He came out.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Do you think he's the only gay Trek-y?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   No.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Who else?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   See, I want to hear...
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Remember, there was a great...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Phil Schatner.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.400]   Yeah, there was a great thing where Schatner and Spock were lovers.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.000]   They took clips from Star Trek and they edited them together.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   No, never seen that.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Oh, Spock.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So rude to think about.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   This is a love that dare not say its name.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   It was really funny.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It was all real clips, but they just edited it in just such a way.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   So, I guess we don't really care what George D'K is sexual orientating.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   You know, it's the twenty-first century, right?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Or twenty-six...
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Whatever century.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   No, no, actually, in real life right now, he came out.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Oh, I was confused.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I thought Mr. Sulu came out.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Oh, all right.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Okay.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I don't realize he was part of the internment though during World War II.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   He was in a whole...
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Yeah, he was like...
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   He was 68 years old.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   So, the Japanese internment camps in California, a lot of Japanese Americans were put in there.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   So, he was one of them.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I didn't know.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   He kind of had that stigma and then the whole thing about suppressing his desires and finally...
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Finally, great.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   He's a presser.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   He's got a hidden show.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I don't know that he suppressed his desires.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Probably not.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I don't think that he did.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   But we don't know.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   According to the article, I remember.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   No.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I think it's because they didn't use his character a lot.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   That was what it was really.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It was all kind of...
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It was all kind of...
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It was all tense about that.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Leonard.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Mr. Sula really should have had a bigger role in that.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.920]   One person posted that they were irritated at the timing of the story of Sula being gay
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.000]   because yesterday Myers was draws and then scooter Libby resigns and then...
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   They're trying to bury...
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   ...and then he's pushing these stories off the front page.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   The pressure was off the front page.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I don't think...
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   What if these bloggers said that?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I like that.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   There's like 400 stories up on Google if you search on.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Really?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   That's interesting.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I must be looking at the wrong part.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   They've all come out like the last like 12 hours.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   What's because the Trekkies and the sci-fi fanatics are the most...
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   The people that are pushing that stuff.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   No, this is C-Ed, E-Online, New York Daily News, Japan.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And I was feeling guilty about covering it on Twitter.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I guess not.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   KTVO.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It's a big story.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   It's crowd parenting.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's crowd parenting everyone.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   UPI, CBC.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So what's your Halloween customer?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Are you going to wear the kiln?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I think it'll be a sailor this year.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   A little sailor boy.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Really?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I have a little sailor boy.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   A little hat?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Well, my wife's dressing up is Rosie the Riveter.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Oh, so you can do a 40s thing.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   That's cool.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Robert, do you dress up for Halloween?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I'm debating at this point.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I'm going to a party tomorrow night.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   After the latex thing.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   I'm just going to wear a mullet.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I think he is wearing a mullet.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I don't want to say anything.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It's totally up to my stylist lady.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I don't tell her what to do.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   She just doesn't.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I'm not going to try that.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Apparently.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I hear they're coming back.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   I was going to go back.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I was going to go back.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I took it off last week.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   She was like, "You know what?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I think it looks cute."
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I thought I needed to hear.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It's a show low.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Go baby.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Sure thing.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   I was going to go with ground cover.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I was just going to get a bunch of leaves.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I got talked into going towards Monty Python style skit here with Kevin and Michael.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I called him up and I was like, "Okay, I need the guy to collapse."
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   The little things.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   The coconuts.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   You got to do the coconuts?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   I have the night thing.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I want you to do a Halloween costume with us.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   If this is a group costume and I have to be the one that looks like a Shabbat.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   You are.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Do the coconut boy.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   He's a coconut boy.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Well, we have kids going to be the guy that got his arm chopped off the black knight.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Oh, that's good.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   He has the costume.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   It's awesome.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   That's great.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   You can buy the black knight costume.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Yeah, you can buy the black knight costume.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   So you're a knight who says me?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   No, I'm not one of the neat knights.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I'm the seagull.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   That's the round table.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   He's our thi-
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   He's our thi-
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   What's the answer about this one?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   What?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   What is your name?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   But he does have speaking of gay.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   He has the gayest looking outfit.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It is rather.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Is it silly?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Do you have to wear tights?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   No.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   No tights, but the boots are just big and I have glitter on the shoulders.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It looks like chain mail.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It's like a go.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It's some crappy costume shop.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   It's a kiss concert right there.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's more like this concert.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   But it was like 20 bucks and it's too small.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   So it's like a little trip.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So we're going to go trick or treating?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   What are you guys doing?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   You going to a party?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Yeah, we're going to a party tomorrow night.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   One of our friends is throwing a party here in San Francisco.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I'm being John Paul the second.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Did you just ask if we were going to go trick or treating?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Why would you be?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   I'm going trick or treating with my kid.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I'm going to be John Paul the second.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I got the hat.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   I've got white makeup, rotten teeth.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I'm in the late John Paul.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I'm with you.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   When do they stop trick or treating them?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Oh, like a real time version of the Pope?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Real time.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Real time.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   It's a man asking me.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   That's what I'm going to say.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I'm going to be on the beach.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Real time.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   So you're a real time version of the Pope.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   That's the geekiest thing I heard.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   It goes from the Catholic insider podcast.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   It's going to be all of the girls.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Oh, I love him.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   He sounds like this, you know, but he's got a Dutch accent.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So it's the strangest combination.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Are you listening to the Dutch?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   He talks like this.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   But then he has the Dutch accent.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   It's a weirdest combination.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   So Google base, base.google.com.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   They took it down.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   It's about five minutes.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   But enough people got screenshots.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Plenty of them.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   So now, of course, everyone wants to know if they're going to take down eBay and Craigslist.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I don't think it's after eBay.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Well, I think it's more after Craigslist.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   It's Craigslist and classified ads.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   It's a database, right?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And you fill out a form.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It says, "Put your stuff on here."
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   And they mention selling your truck, but they also mention your business.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   So it would be a way that people could search.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   You know, it's a website, right?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I mean, except without a website, it's a database.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And when people search Google or search Google base, they'll find it.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   But I think it is classified.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I don't think it hurts eBay because they don't have any of the transactions.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Well, except for the fact that they own a huge chunk of Craigslist.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   They do?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   They've made a huge investment in Craigslist.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   eBay, I might be wrong.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I think 20%?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   But that hurts eBay then.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I know that I remember when eBay was there.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I remember when eBay bought part of Craigslist, everyone was terrified that they were going
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   to ruin it because Craigslist is great.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   They haven't had a site redesign.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It's still as funky as ever.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And it's just great.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   So it makes you think, like, how could you take down Craigslist?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   It works just great, but there's always a room.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Well, Craigslist is taking down the newspapers.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Newspaper classified revenues down fantastically.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It's hurting them badly.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And this would just be more of the same, right?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Well, imagine putting, imagine enabling better function of Google search on Craigslist and
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   imagine using Google's ability to localize stuff into it at the same time.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   You don't even have to go into Google in San Francisco or Google.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   I like Google in nowhere you are if you tell it.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Is this new or is it?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I just noticed it because I signed up for, you know, I have a Google account.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   When I do a search now, it'll tell me how many times I've been to the pages that come up
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   and the results.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Have you seen that?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   It's like bookmarking them or letting you know.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   You can say your search results.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   You can say your search results.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Yeah, except that when I do it, so I do a search in the top site as a site I've been to,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   it says you've been here four times.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   That's interesting.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I'm not saying that.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I know it's a search history function.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   It's kind of like that.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Is it through a cookie or through a log in?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   It's through a cookie.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It must be through a cookie.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Well, no, because I have a Google account.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   So it does get the track of your searches and stuff.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   But I've never noticed this before, that it's keeping track of how many times I've been
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   to a site.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Does that scare you a little bit?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Well, you know, you don't have to log in.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   You know, if you know what's doing it, like...
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I should just log out.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   But see, that's the whole idea.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   They get you, it's the AOL model.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   They get you sucked in on all these servers.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Do you use the Google personalized home?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   That's my home page.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Okay.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Well, that's...
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   So I'm always logged into Google.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But that's right.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   I've never seen it because I don't use that, which means it's got to be based on Google
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   I'm sure.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   This was back in like May, I think.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   That they started...
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Well, I know they did the personalized search, but this is the first time I've noticed these
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   numbers, and again, it could well be them doing it since May.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Well, as long as they give you the ability to go in and turn it off, do you think it's
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   an interesting statistic for you to see how many times you've been to this?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Yeah, it just worries me that they know it, too.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   I mean, that's exactly the thing that people get upset about spyware for keeping track of
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   where you've been.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   This is a conversation we had like 10 years ago with people who were running ISPs.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   It's like my email is going to be in your server.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   You look at that stuff like, "No, no, no, I'm a benevolent manager of the email system."
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   But Gmail doesn't bother me, and that's what the complaint was about Gmail, too.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   But that doesn't bother me so much.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I mean, they're aggregating more and more of what I do.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Yes.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   People are worried about that stuff.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   They shouldn't send their photos to a 24-hour photo of development place.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   That's the truth.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Because my friend used to work in my...
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   He said, "Yeah, there's some pretty..."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   They keep the good ones.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   My friends had coffee book tables.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   They had the albums, and they used to collect the worst of it and have it laying right there
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   on the outside.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   People think that no one sees these photos when you send them off.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   I have a friend who says, "Yeah."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   It's like 20 people.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   A radiologist in the hospital, and they also have a book which they share of fun X-rays.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Oh, the hell?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Exactly.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Exactly, Patrick.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Oh, no, get this.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   The light bulb didn't break.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Yeah, it's exactly.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I've seen these pictures.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   They don't worry about that.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   I could see it.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   At a photo lab, you don't have to worry about it quite as much, but the medical malpractice,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   you kind of do it a lot.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I'm sure you can sign your life away when you go into a hospital.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Yeah, but I don't think they're supposed to distribute your X-rays around.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Well, they take the name.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   There's no name on it.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   John Doe's.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   You'd be amazed.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   That's all I could say.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Anatomically emotional.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   It was a bill.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Joe, you said, "Get over it.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Privacy is already dead."
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Yeah, it wasn't.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   It was Scott McNeilly.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   It's the same idea, though.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   He said, "Forget it."
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I think it's still something worth fighting for.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   I'm not saying it's not worth fighting for.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   The only way to do it, though, is not have a credit card.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Pay cash for everything.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And of course, you'll drive everywhere, because you can no longer buy an airplane.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Right.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   You don't leave any data crumbs, but it's impossible now.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Well, it's impossible in the United States without a lot of effort or really interesting
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   life stuff.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Well, you have to literally drop out of that.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   There are a lot of people off the grid in the United States.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I think.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   A lot of people off the grid.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   A lot of people off the grid in this city.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   There's an interesting initiative.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   This isn't related, but it's -- well, it is related.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   In San Francisco and the surrounding counties want to keep track of homeless people, because
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   the problem is they go from county to county, right?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   So they want to track them.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Which sounds -- Chip them.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   What are they going to do?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   All right.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   If I deal with them.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   They're going to track them.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I think that to me, that's -- so you can't drop out of it, even if you're homeless.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   That's been a problem for a long time, for like at least 10 years.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Floating, floating homeless.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Basically, people will sign up for services in every county.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Anywhere the bark goes, basically, here in the Bay Area, and they collect accordingly.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   There's also some traditions of dumping where people from outlying counties, especially
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   a fluent suburbs, will drive homeless people.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Literally, you're going to Oakland.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.400]   And then a lot of other cities for a long time were simply saying, "We'll give you a free
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.000]   bus ticket to San Francisco."
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Right.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And it was like -- because they have great services.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   The climate's not -- which is good and bad at the same time, but I hear a lot of complaints
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   from the locals around here, huh?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   So, getting worse.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   So we're all in IPTV spaces.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Everybody here is.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   That's kind of weird.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   How did that happen?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I don't know.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   It's all the tech TV --
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Right, get the phone we wanted.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So we did it ourselves.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   We just did it ourselves.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I think it's kind of neat, really.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Somebody made a really nice couple of them.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   They referred to the G4 takeover as tech TV as the spawning of the -- they called it the
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   spawning of the Xerox park of IPTV.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   A little bit nicer than we deserved.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Yeah, I agree, but it was --
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   But that is kind of like that.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   We're all off doing our own thing.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And what's nice is we're all together.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   It's co-opetition.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Co-opetition.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   I don't mind what you guys are doing.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   It's great.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   It scares me when I see the Comedy Central.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   It's got four online IPTV channels.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Oh, anyone can do it.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And the pros can have a lot of money.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Well, they can have a lot of money.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   They can probably.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   What's the story with this?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   The first network to do this, yes?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Well, but there's nothing.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I mean, there's --
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Go ahead.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I mean, I'm just going to say, who cares?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   It's just streaming content.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I mean, everyone's been doing this for a long time.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   I'm going to MSNBC.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   We've seen that for like the last five years.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   CNN TV.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   But they're pitching it like it's four channels.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Like it's a little --
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Well, that's --
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   All right, how are you going to make this pop?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It's just people.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Let's get to the PR people.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And it's like, you know, we're the first companies.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   So it's not a network.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It's basically a website with streaming content content.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   No, no, no.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Mr. Prager, you don't seem to understand what we've done here with Comedy Central.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   We've leveraged our extraordinary content.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Yeah, but I mean --
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   But think about it.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   How do you know when it's PR?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   There's leveraged.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   There's synergy.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   There's, you know --
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   But now, well, if they were to do a webpage where there's four channels, you know,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   this is the rough stuff for over 21.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   This is, you know, four different channels.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   You click it and it was on all day all night.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   It was a channel that was on your computer.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   That, to me, would be -- I mean, that's -- that's saying we don't need cable anymore, right?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I mean, isn't --
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   But I mean, CNN said that -- I mean, there's still a lot of money being made in cable,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   but CNN said a while back, you know, much earlier this year,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   they're like, we're going to put whatever we want online.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Right.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   You know, that was just --
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   You just turn on and it's on.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   But how many centrals says like, they don't -- they're going to put in like,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   you know, a lot of three-minute things.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   They think it's like a half an hour show and still going to be watched --
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Well, I mean, normal TV and --
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I mean, that's a fundamental argument, right?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Which reminds me, this is the -- we're done because we're only going to 25 minutes from now on.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   But it means there's stuff that's totally different than a lot of -- like,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   digital life TV is available streaming, but it's also available down -- you can't download any of this stuff for our own.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   That's not what essentials do.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Everybody can download and keep their content.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I mean, that's a huge divide because there's people -- I've sat in an office and have been told,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   you know, there's really no market for this long stuff on the web.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   People don't want to --
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Right.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And it's like, what?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   BitTorrent?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   VLC?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Ten million clients a three and a half months?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   What do you think they're watching?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Do you watch Nerd TV?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   I wouldn't want to watch that streaming.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I'd rather just download and watch it.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And be able to sit there and watch it anywhere.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   But if you think about it, they like streaming because you can't save it.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   You can't distribute it yourself.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   You can't take out the commercial.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And it's easier for advertising.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   You guys, that's actually easier for advertising.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   You have to watch the ad.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   There's no 30 seconds to skip.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Yeah, but I think it's not so much that they can count the ad that way.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   If you download it.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It's better.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   It's better for them.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   They can make more money.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Traffic to their website, number one.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And two, they're taking advantage of what's already available online.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Ozart people have already recorded these shows over the air and posted them to some torrent site.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   So why not redirect that traffic to your website and provide the downloads right there in a format that, you know?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   But you can put a --
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   You can put a program on your website.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   You can have a round -- they're already on your website.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   You can stick ads anywhere else.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   You should see some of the new tools that are coming out for the Flash, which is what a lot of people are using.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Flash videos are so easy because everybody has Flash.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   But they're migrating the tools across Flash to other codecs and you'll be able to pick rolling spots for ads, lower thirds that pop in on ads.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   There's even sites now that take a stream and integrate an ad into it and then send it out to you.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   So they're on the fly.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   And that's what annoys me about regular TV is why I started downloading shows in the first place.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   It's to avoid that you watch a show in like prime time nowadays, they'll have a lower third pop up in like the first ten seconds that show comes back from a commercial.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Then they'll have some crawl up the side for another show that may be coming up later that evening.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   And you can no longer see -- I mean, even like two thirds of the show being cut off due to these ads that are now --
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And people want to do it too dynamically.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   People want to do it in its own interface.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   They're going to start doing that.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   So I'm already putting serenity onto my iPod video so I can watch it on the plane.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I think that'll be fun, right?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   What do you -- is any -- what's the deal with iPod video encoding?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Have you guys kind of started working on that?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It's easy to do.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   One click video or exactly the same thing.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   If you use the quick switch -- what do you do?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Do you get video for free?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Oh, yeah, the aura.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Yeah, I downloaded that.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Just watch.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   I mean, they only have to be careful as if you've got --
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   You have to put time seven to do that.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It does it without that.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Not without that.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   You don't need the pro version.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Okay.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   The biggest thing is just making sure when you're encoding that you're paying attention, whether or not your original content is an HD wide screen format or if it's 4 by 3.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   You want 320 -- 320 by 240.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Well, everything ends up being 320 by 240, but yeah.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Well, you can encode for 40 by 480 on the iPod, which would be fine if you're playing back on a TV.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Yeah, but I mean, if you're doing MPEG-4, but it screws it up on the iPod screen.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Yeah, you're either going to skinny vision it or you're going to cut it off or you're going to have that little tiny --
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Yours had bars on it.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Yeah, but it all depends on how you encode it and also depends on whether you have wide screen playback.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   The other thing is you can do a pretty high resolution output --
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   higher resolution output from the iPod or the iPod on the new video version.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I was playing it on the TV.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I was watching Desperate to Housewise on the TV.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   You can get a higher resolution like an NTSC.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Right.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   You can get 40 by 480, right?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   No, higher than that.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   I'm not 52.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Well, that's really encoding.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   We just use QuickTime Pro because it's a single click.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   It's like iPod video click.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   But the problem with that though is it's MP4.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   It's MP4.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   It's not H.264.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   No, it's 5641.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   It does that.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Are you sure?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Yeah, I think it's --
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Really?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Why would they do that?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Why wouldn't it do it to H.264?
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   How is it?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   It takes more process.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   H.264 is so process intensive.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   So in order for that to work on the --
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   When it creates an M4 V file, it's creating an impact for it.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   It's not using the H.264 compressor.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Yeah, and it's creating a huge file.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   It's creating a tool.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I know that.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   For ours, we're watching like it's like 40% larger.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Yes, it's for us considerably.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   So, Vidiora is the way to go.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And that lets you choose --
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Yeah, but I mean, what Alex was saying is that part of the problem is the battery life's
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   already miserable on a 2.25, maybe 2.5 hours of battery life.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And we haven't -- we've just started doing some testing over PC, Madigan over at Extreme iPod,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   but it's like we're looking to see what happens if we run an H.264.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   I mean, do we lose even more of that power?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   You probably would because it's so intense.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Yeah, it's so intense.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Although, you know, often you have a processor intensive on the front end so that you can play it back easier.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   It's not so bad on the other side.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Let me know what you find out.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   I'm sorry, I'm quoting whenever you guys are.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Well, no, it's easy.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   That way I don't have to do anything.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   It's like Patrick's with a lot of people.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   No, but you saved my ass more than once, or is it Kevin?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   What are we doing with this?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Why hasn't anybody sat down and explained all the video encoding options anywhere?
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Well, that's what's fun about this.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   We're all figuring it out at the same time.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   That's right.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I think that's the best thing.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Tiki TV does a good job.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Oh, we're going to -- we all love -- we all love a lot.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Quick, quick.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   A drool cup.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Tiki vah.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   What is this?
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Tiki TV.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   I'll show you later.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   As soon as I pop video, as soon as the iPod, the video I pop it in, it popped up to number
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   one.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   So, of course, all of us are at least I did.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Yeah, obviously we had.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I saw the first episode and then the second.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Right October, the last one is a circle.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   It's about the fourth.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   It's about the idea.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Lala grows on you.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Lala is a --
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I hear there's other people on that.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Just a great job.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   I know that town.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   She's a --
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Downloading now.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Very good talent.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Tiki vah.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I don't know who they are.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   You and I both correspond with them.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Yes.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   I talked to Dr. Tiki.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   I asked Dr. Tiki --
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   He tells himself.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   He says he emails Dr. Tiki.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   I said --
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Which I'll be on the show.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   He said only if we can stay in care.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   So you guys are fanboys a little bit.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   I don't think we both wrote to the Tiki vah.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Why don't you guys just dress up at the time for a holy --
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   I don't think I could pull that on.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I've already invested in Pope outfits.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And he's got the gay night.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   That's right.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And I'm my clapper.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Did you see this NTT?
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   [laughter]
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Did you see this NTT Dokomo has created a joystick that makes your head bob?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Why did it --
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Why did it keep coming back?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   They've actually --
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   This is the big phone company in Japan.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   So it's not like some cuckoo mad scientist somewhere.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   But they put electrodes on your head.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Oh, that would be so cool.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   They put electrodes on your head.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And they've already steered a human through a maze using this thing.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   It's a human remote control.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   It's a human remote control.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So I have a remote control.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I put electrodes in your skull.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Yeah, I can make you --
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   You can steer me.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And the other hope not of our producers is for all of this.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Yeah, that's funny because you should say that because somebody said,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   "Oh, that's great.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   We can get you to be on the right camera."
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   [laughter]
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   You just go like that.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   [laughter]
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I just want to see them hook up a dance dance revolution in their arcade.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   You know that's what they're looking at.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Or driving games.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And your head will go like this as you steer.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I'm sure that's what they're looking at.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   That's a lost way to happen here in the States, though, right?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   You probably couldn't do it.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I don't know.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I don't know.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   The game shows are crazy.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   I don't know how they're going to work back to the next one.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   But they don't know what network wins that stuff.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   You notice when people fall and play.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And they double over it.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I don't like what Spike does to it.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I want to see the original.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   You know, it's the same thing with other insurance.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   It's a spy stuff.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   It's pretty funny.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Everybody making up reminds me when I was a kid.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I heard Chef I can get like the subtitles.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And I heard Chef are great.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   But like the MXC watching the guy go, "It's Bob Parvowak.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Gotta, Laura, works in chewing gum removal from shoes.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Tokyo's Grand Central Station."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And I'm like, "That's a great show."
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   All right.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   All right.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Maybe they'll stream that.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Hey, talk about Lala.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Wow.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Did you see that Microsoft got a little trouble with Judge Catelli?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Kathleen Qatar Catelli, whatever her name is, for the trust settlement.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   They put out a memo that said that everybody who is going to make portable cell music and
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   music stores had to, or sorry, cell portable players had to ship it with Windows Media
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Player or else.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Or else, you know, you must use Windows Media.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And of course that's a horrible violation of their antitrust settlement.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And the judge came down and said, "How'd this happen?"
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   "Here's Microsoft's excuse."
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   They said, "Oh, we got a new guy.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   He didn't know what the rules were."
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   He picked excellent.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   That's awesome.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   He didn't remember that one.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   So, he pointed it on the new guy.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   The new guy.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It was the new guy.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.120]   And somehow, you know, he wrote this memo and it went to every portable music player
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.000]   manufacturer in the world.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   So they've pulled back on that.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   The judge was very upset.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   How would you have the gall to say that anyway?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   If you're Microsoft?
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   It's their place for sure.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   It's hard.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   You must include Windows Media Player.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   You're trying to ensure a consistent user experience.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And if you're going to be part of our branded place for your system, you need to include
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   You're so good at that, Patrick.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   You must have read far too many press releases.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   I don't know.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Raised by salespeople.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I've been doing it.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Yeah, reading press releases like a thousand a year for the last decade.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Blends.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Microsoft also says, "I don't know if we want to believe this.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   This might be the new guy too."
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   That software, the software industry is ill-prepared to make use of the new dual core processors.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   From AMD and Intel.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   What they're really saying is, "Vista won't be dual core."
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Well, I mean, I think on this, there's this.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Which is kind of, if you think it's kind of bizarre since they're introducing the Xbox 360
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   with three processors.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And they already developed the IDE and the APIs for that system.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   So it seems kind of...
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I don't think they're just preparing us for a huge disappointment with Vista.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   That's what I think.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Programmers are still getting the feet wet though, dealing with multi-threaded, multi-core systems.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Doesn't the compiler just do it?
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Yeah, the compiler...
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   But think about the thread we were reading online.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   The guy was sitting there and he moved to a dual core system.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And Firefox, just the performance, went to Snot.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And he couldn't figure out, he finally ended up reassigning it.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   So it aligns itself with one processor.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Oh, it wasn't threading.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Instead of being threaded.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   It was affecting every other application on a system too when you had that window open.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   That's kind of scary.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   So if we all go out and buy dual core Pentium D's, we might have four X-2 processors.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Smaller machines?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Wow.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Does anybody have a dual core?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   We used to do that in our gaming machines.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Remember the memory...
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   You just sign it to one processor.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Yeah, we had to.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Do the one processor would run the server and the other one would run the actual game and stuff.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   And that actually helped out.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Strange.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Well, who was it?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Carmack, who said that the processors are worthless for...
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Yeah, he said that it would probably not come into its own until the next generation.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   So now Microsoft's saying the same thing.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Which means it makes me wonder, maybe I should just hold off on the next two.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Well, in particular for the Xbox 360, it's really about XNA, the software platform that they're using, and hopefully maybe they can enable some tools in there that make it simply easier to...
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   All the games right now.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I don't know if you can really port for the 360.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Single threaded apps.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   I think you really have to take a look at what the application's doing overall.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Because you have to think about what's going on.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   You have to...
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   You have a lot of prediction.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   You have to do.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Who's played with the latest Vista?
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   You guys play with it all?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   No.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Seeing a little bit.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   What do you think?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Well, it's a beta.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Why even bother?
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I mean, it's not going to look that way in a year, is it?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Well, I think that's the only thing that's going to be consistent is the arrow and the glass interface.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   And there's going to be some stuff integrated in Windows Media Player 11, which will be available for XP and Internet Explorer 7, which will be available for XP.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Mac OS.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   That's where I just put it that way.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   I tell you.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   So, is it like at the point where 2000 was still known as NT5?
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Windows Vista.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Like NT2 here.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Microsoft really needs to do it, to be honest.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   What they really, really need to do is start stealing some employees from Apple.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   That's what they have to do.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   I mean, that's what Google's doing to them.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   I mean, they should go and hire some UI designers from Apple or something.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   What happens if Apple employees at that level try to leave?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   They must just get sued into a movie.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   They're probably killed.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   They're probably eliminated.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.800]   There's a bunch of assassins with black
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.000]   coal mix, but we're running around.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   With white Apple logos in their chest, they just remember those hinges.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   The Apple ninjas.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Isn't this a vision of an employee agreement where it's like, if you leave Apple, you can work in farming.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   You can teach skiing.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   They probably get one medical benefit to go in for surgery.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   You have this big scar on their forehead.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Actually, Apple employees leave all the time.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   As long as Steve Jobs doesn't leave.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And Jonathan Ives doesn't leave.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   They're all chipped.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   They have a giant bat.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Google bats.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Bill Gates says, "We do not fear Google."
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   That's a direct quote.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   When you start saying things like that.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   It's scared to death.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   You should make those comments.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   We're not scared.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Well, he prefaced it by saying they're a very serious big competitor.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   I mean, I'm paraphrasing.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Well, it's interesting because you would think operating system company, web search engine.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Web services.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Web services are taking over the roles of a lot of software.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   But OfficeOS, who needs it?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Who needs it?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   This is everything I'm sitting like, we have nothing to fear but fear itself.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Just wait, man.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Google's going to get slapped with an NHS suit in about three years.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Bill Gates gets trick-or-treaters.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Bill Gates gets trick-or-treaters.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Bill Gates gets trick-or-treaters.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   You and I could go as Sergey and Larry.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Yeah, but there's a gate.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   There's a gate.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Then like a mile of lawn before you take it anywhere near the house.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Do you guys see that online office suite?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   What is it?
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   It's like an Excel-type program?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Yeah, I think free.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Yeah, that's very cool.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   That's been around for a while.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   It's a long time.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   So that's like an example too.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And now Microsoft's saying that we are going to support, this is the weirdest thing.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   They just announced they're going to support the open office extensions.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Oh, they did.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Yeah, for reading.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And you know who it is?
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   It's Aussie.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   The lotus guy.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   What's his name?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Ray Aussie.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Really?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Who is now at Microsoft.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   He's I think his CTO over there.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And comes from kind of a non-Microsoft background.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And Aussie is saying, yeah, you know, we don't feel a file format should be real proprietary.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Well, wasn't that because, like, wasn't it Massachusetts or someone that said we're not going to take office unless they do the open file format or open format?
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Which I think is very interesting.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   My biggest problem with using open office is because the fact that I have to save it out as a Microsoft compatible, if I want to send it to most people because they're using office.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Well, ideally, and Microsoft always makes noise that they're going to do some sort of XML format.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   I mean, ideally there would be a kind of cross-platform.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   There is.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   There's RTF.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I use RTF all the time.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Well, there are also some huge arguments on the web talking about open office where people are comparing the amount of memory, the footprint, and the processor time it takes for open office to say open up a thousand table Excel spreadsheet where it takes like three and a half minutes for open office versus like 15 seconds for.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Excel has been around a long time. It's been tuned and tuned and tuned. I mean, what version is it? 15, 6? I mean, this?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   But, you know, two or three years from now, free versus, I mean, some of these guys, Fortune 500's are going to say, "Hey, do we really want to spend, you know, half a million dollars renewing our office license this year or should we just go for free?"
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   But think of all the time, it will save when you shave three seconds off.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   I think the businesses aren't that sure said. I think they don't look at the cost of the software. They look at the overall cost.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Me, J&N, the company I used to work for was busted by the disgruntled ex-employee who called up Microsoft. No, a couple jobs back.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   They called up Microsoft and they came down and turned out there was like less than 1% of the systems in the company had some sort of some problem with the software load.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   They can't just come in.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   They essentially can't. But the thing is, that prompted the company then to dump every piece of Windows software in the entire company, switch it all over Linux, hire a couple of IT guys, and then they were able to customize every load on every desktop.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   It's like, "Why does my account need a web browser?" It's like, "I don't want them surfing the web. Don't put that on here."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   But now they spend next to nothing. They can keep the same old hardware they've had forever, which is another big benefit of using Linux.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   It's a really neat solution. It's a good example, I think, for a lot of companies.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Are you happy it's worked for them?
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   They have more control over the device.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   I can't surf at my desk.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   I think trouble.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   We have e-virus running all over the place at work.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I don't know how people do it.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   I've never seen any of this stuff.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   I haven't had a virus in six years.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   No, seriously?
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   If you had a rocket on there, you wouldn't know.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   I hate how people just freak out. There's so much fear. There's a hacker on my machine.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   There is a lot of that. People really do freak out.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Anything goes wrong, they assume.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   It's a hacker.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   My mom called me a hundred.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Who's going to hack it?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   My CD drawer opens all the time.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   It does.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   I'm going to take a picture.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I'm going to take a picture.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   That's not right.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   That's something I was talking about.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   A high school kid is like final prank before he just graduated high school is to actually add to the kernel of the Linux system they had in their network was to open and close all the CD drawers.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   There was just no way to stop it.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   They had to basically reload everything because they actually stuck it into the kernel itself.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   I was just like, "Dude, that's cool."
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   That is one argument against open source is that you've got the source.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   You can recompile.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   You can rebuild.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I need a new feature.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I was actually going up against 13 spam operations that are zombying computers.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   I think there really is an argument against Windows users and normal people using Windows because they have a hard time securing it.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Almost all the spam is being sent right now as zombie PCs running Windows.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   You don't even know what it's like.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   There's a lot of spam being still being run by legitimate.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   What they do is they create, well, probably possibly, but what's happening is you get these people in Eastern Europe and they're not going to be able to do it.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   You're right, they originate the spam, but what they do is they use these zombie computers to distribute it all over the United States.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   The FTC is joining Microsoft.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Doing it.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Good money.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   You bet.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   They get like 10 cents, 7 to 10 cents.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   They hired great programmers to write good viruses to take over systems.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   That was cash in.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Tired of the Cold War, although the government invested heavily in computer programming and science.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   You get a lot of Romanians who have no jobs.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   But they all have PhDs in the fact.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Who knows?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   You think the ISPs are still relaying spam?
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   I was sitting in one of my welding classes like six months ago.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I'm learning on a tag well.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I have issues.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   It's an off-road thing.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Give me my shot.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   He needs the shot.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   You should take this.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   If you came down the road with a skirt, I mean a kill, and that scared the hell out of a cop on the way over here.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   When you walk around with a gun, it looks like a weapon.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   It's like a super-soaker.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   It does.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   It's like a aluminum super-soaker.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   From paint.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   There's a product like high-end super-soakers made of aluminum and titanium.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   There's a fire hydrant.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   They're modified to make them flame throwers.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Those are kind of cool.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   That's amazing.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   You put butte in it, but they're plastic.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   They put metal tips in the end.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   It's fun to make.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Don't try to get home.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Let us kids.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Yeah, you water cuts better than lasers.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Usually if you get a cut through so much steel.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   You have to use a grid of water too, don't you?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Yeah, depending on the material.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   You ever see a Levi's cuts jeans?
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   So in your welding class.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   I'm sorry, we got this track.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Just going welding.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   I was sitting there.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I mean, not actually by me, but by four other people like, "Oh, I'm going to telecommunication.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   We make money off."
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Basically, he's talking about all the immigrants they've fleeced through really bad deals for calling cards.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   The ones you pick up and the pharmaceuticals.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   It's such a scam.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   That allowed him to bankroll servers.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   He still makes huge money off of basically running open.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Basically figuring out a way to do a real life service for spammers.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   He's basically talking about the incredibly expensive Italian sports car that he's restoring.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   It's just sitting there and you're like, "Enjoy it now because you're going to hell, sir."
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   No.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   If there is a hell that's going to be looking for that on some island making 20% more likely.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   So is there anyone who hasn't traveled overseas recently that needs to get a new passport?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I heard that.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   I'm getting a new one in February.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   So you're going to be...
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Will I get the chip?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   You're going to beat the cut if...
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   When do they start putting RFID in these things?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   So does it go with even...
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Like I have like another four years left.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Yeah, you won't have to get a new one, but the next one you get.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   But mine runs out in February, so I'm getting one probably pretty soon.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   They say by next year they want to do all their passports.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   They're already swiping and scanning current passports.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   Yeah, they're sending us a barcode that had information.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   There's a barcode on it.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   After October 2006, everyone just makes it so hard to duplicate another barcode.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Instead, it just takes that whatever that number is and drops it into a chip that they can scan.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Are there any safeguards for ever-s icedis?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Somebody told me they're going to use...
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Yeah, foil pages on either side of it.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   We'll find out.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   No, they're actually going to do that to make it so that you can't read them.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   It'll be interesting to see what it turns out to be when it ships.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Put in the little lead...
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   What RFID experts have told me, they're not that readable.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   You've got to get pretty close.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   I've seen somebody read RFID tags from 60 feet away.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   60?
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   That was a DEF CON, right?
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Yeah, it was John's crew.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   John Herring's crew.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Bryant in the process.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Was it a microwave or a sneaker?
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   No, I guess you said that's sort of enough receiver.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   He just was a big old honking antenna.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   And that's the fear is that if you're carrying a passport, somebody...
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Well, of course then they have to decode it, although presumably that won't be so hard to do.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   I hope they do a better job than Xerox did in coding the color laser.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   So is it an active radio frequency that comes out of it, or is he just bouncing a radio wave?
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   How does that work?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   You bounce some off of it.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   So you're being...
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   I can try to explain it, but I'll screw it up so bad.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   I believe you're just exciting it.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   And then it simply emits, using the energy that it receives.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Just like a shock.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Exactly.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   And the other ones are shocked.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Same thing as...
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   You can say it's shock and it emits.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   I love your dead, get it shipped.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   So basically...
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   I just want to walk out of the grocery store and be done.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   I hate it.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   This grocery store is now these cheap.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   It's like Alberts'...
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Oh, the self checkouts?
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   The self checkouts are out.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Everyone's a good home depot.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   There's a guy standing there and home depot.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   You're the guy looking at you.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   He's looking at you like I'm going to steal something.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And it really isn't much to keep you from stealing.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   I find a bus and they'll await...
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   And it always says put it in the basket and then you put it in and it never registers it.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   And it's a pain in them.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   I was thinking the triggers are just to refuse to use them and hope that they'll give up and go back to hiring people.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   I think it started out with a wall marker or something.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   First one I saw was in a supermarket...
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Actually an upscale supermarket in San Diego.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Sometimes it works better though.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Sometimes it works better though.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Sometimes it works better.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   It's only the time people actually have someone else who wants to use it.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   You can take a little more.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   I use them.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   I don't have any problem with it.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   I mean as long as you know exactly what to expect it's like trying to use a voice recognition system.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   And if you're standing there in the street you know it's not going to work.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   But if you know exactly how to hold your hand or with a phone and have it done so you can find through it.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   But you can find through it.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   It's not used fairly yet.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   You took up as one thing as you're friendly and it's a four hour experience just trying to get in and out of there.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   And at least you have that.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   It weighs it.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   You drag it.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   You put it in the other bag over here.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   It weighs it again.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Your money goes in here.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Your change comes out here.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   The credit card slot is here.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   The screen is here at an angle you can't read.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   It's the worst.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   It's the worst design ever.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   They give you 5% off.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   Do they do?
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   No I said no.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   They did because they did.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Do what they used.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   You know it's some super much.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   Just check me out through a regular and I'll bag it myself.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   No I want to bag it.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   I want to check out Clerk.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   I want them to ask me paper or plastic and say have a nice day.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Do you have a guy that takes your groceries out for you?
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Yes.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   When you get over it will have to be my age.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Do you like to help?
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Yes.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   They do it to everybody.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   But see what Kevin was saying is the ideal situation.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   You walk into the store and your credit card has a little RFID type tag on it.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   You grab everything you want.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Stick it in your cart and walk out the door.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   That would be kind of what I wanted to do.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   That would be kind of cool.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   That's a Walmart.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   How long is it going to be before that?
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   No.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   You've got a park of van out front with an antenna inside and be like oh yeah.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   I'm scanning.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Why do you have a car-packing van in your parking lot for the 3rd month in a row?
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Save us all.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   IMDB is 15 years old.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Happy birthday.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Can you believe it's 15?
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   That's really scary.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Was there an 8 on that in 1990?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   No.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   No.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   How did you do that?
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Where did you get that information?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   From the LA Times.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   They didn't start online.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Well, there was an internet.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   The web was one year old.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   It must have been a website.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   It must have been to database.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   That shows that the building's first in bed.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   The Hollywood bin there a long time.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   They were on ARPANET.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   The movie database now.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   It was a British guy.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   He found it would eventually become the internet movie database.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Oh, so it was in his closet for the first 10 years.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Yes.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Send your name over there.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   There's a little bit of a news.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Oh, it started as "rect.art.movie".
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   That's it.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   "rect.art.movie".
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   So it was a news group.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Oh.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   It's the number 44 website on the internet according to Alexa.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I use it all the time, don't you?
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.400]   If you look up any actor, actress, generally the number one of the top four links, even
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:22.000]   if they have big fan club site, it's Tom Cruise, one of the top four is going to be their IMDB profile.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   I think you're still in it, right?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   I'm in there.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Are you in there?
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   They don't have a picture.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   You have to pay them to carry a picture of you.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   And you know, it's someone fubarred mine because they combine mine with another Roger Chang.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   There's more than one.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   I actually support Google all the time.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   I'm in a movie that I made.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   They could use a majority of K.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Have you guys seen Roger?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   He's like Google ads everywhere.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   No, that's what he's doing.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Yes, we talked about it.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I've been using it for a second.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   I used it two days and now I can't stop.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   There's a pay you each time I'm in fact.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   In fact, we mentioned it in a Twitter a while ago and somebody sent me the link, the image
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   to it.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   You put it in the TV in the Google, Roger Chang.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   I sang using it two days ago and I can't stop using it.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   You see more.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   You see more.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   It's a piece of it.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   It wasn't even my pick.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   It was like, someone else is like, all right, that's great.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   That was at the time the affirmation that we needed that tech TV mattered.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Not anymore.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Oh, you mocked me.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Anything else you guys want to talk about before we wrap this sucker?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Oh, I saw a funny story.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   I don't know.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   It's something that's coming out in the journal Nature, I think.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   It was talking about Einstein and Darwin and the number of letters they receive and the
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   number of letters they sent out and they said they're very characteristic of the way people
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   like us use email.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   I don't know who kept these characters.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Einstein sent more than 14,500 letters but he received more than 16,200 and responded
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   to a quarter of them.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Darwin mailed 7,500 letters and he responded 32%.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   How do you keep this day?
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Because they're also talking about how many of them responded within 10 days versus responding
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   to 50 days and they're talking about their habits are very similar to the type of habits
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   people that receive a lot of email.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   You can create an algorithm that predicts how many people are going to respond to emails
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   to what people and...
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   Obviously, they've got a grant buddy.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   That makes sense though.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   They were probably early examples of people who get a lot of mail.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   But you have to actually sit down and write it.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   I have shortcuts.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   I use text pander and I can type a three letter abbreviation for most of the stuff that I
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   write.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   I'll open an email and even then I still can't answer every email I get but it sure saves
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   a lot of time.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   So three, three letters.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   So if I type gg4 it says that I'm giving away my secrets now.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Thank you very much for your support.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   We're really glad to be back on g4 tech TV and we couldn't have done it without your cards
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   and letters so keep watching and we're trying to get a better time.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   And then...
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   [laughter]
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   It's p-ing right now.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   I thought I received another video.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   So what if it's better than you send me a get well card?
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   It was just two letters.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   It's a little rubber stamped.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   I do press the send button myself.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   I don't have a system to do.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   You know what?
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   You need to make it a recursive action.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   Well, I do have a number of different boiler plates so I can combine...
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   But just make it an apple script so you can get a list of all the names that you have a certain
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   form letter you need to send to.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   It would be nice if somebody would write this, I would appreciate it.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Some sort of artificial intelligence thing that could look at the message and know what my answer would be.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Right?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   So I don't even have to think about it.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   I think IBM's working on that.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Yeah, just a few keywords.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   You just have to let Google and Planet Cookie do this.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Google could do this.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Just, you know, see the 12 keywords?
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   You know, if they mention G4 and welcome back or glad to have you back or...
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   I'd try to say synergy or leverage.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Or you're a jerk.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   And it just, you know...
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   They like very much.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   It could just throw in different non-transitive.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   And there's two syllable verb.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Two syllable verb.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   It rhymes with the orange.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   So how do you keep it with all like piles of old, do you have to go through and batch delete a bunch of stuff?
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   What do you do?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   What do you mean?
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   After I answer?
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   No, like stuff that you just never got.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   I mean, they're just still watching emails.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   You should actually get open a library.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Well, no, someday they'll do a study on me and they'll say, you know...
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   A leo la port.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   He was a precursor of holographic email systems.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   The leo la port presidential library.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Yeah, no, I don't think so.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   I smoked far too much bot for that.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   No, actually, it's not the pot of sea acid.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   It'll really get there.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Is this going to be in the podcast?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   I think the tape's rolling right now.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   See, now if it's not...
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   It's not...
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   It's just the words.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Are you going to be in the library?
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   No, I'd be in the library.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   It could be anything.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Patrick said the S word a couple...
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Maybe it was the last time at the time.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   And I got all this email.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   What did he say?
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   What are you saying?
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   It says, "Not that interesting, frankly."
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   But you're right.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   There's a great book called "Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer" where the guy writes a normal bad novel.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   He never gets it published.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   So he cuts out all the verbs and nouns.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   And people interpret it as pornography.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   And he's a huge bestseller.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   Nice.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Anybody see the Copyright Office is looking for feedback on the DMCA.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   November 2nd through December 1st, 2005.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Interesting to see what happens.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   They can't do anything anyway.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   I mean, they have a member's pass to it already though.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Congress passed a law.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   A heft Congress has to make the change, not the copyright office.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Maybe if enough people shout out the Congress people will talk to us.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Our technique had a good article on that.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   He was proposing an amendment, this few amendments, the DMCA.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   I mean, the issue with the digital millennia.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   I love saying that.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Digital millennium copyright.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   I was trying to say the millennium falcon copyright.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   According to George Lucas production.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   According to our technique, after its last look at the DMCA, just quoting,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   "The copyright office in 2003 issued a handful of exemptions to law,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   including software protected by dongles."
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   In the case where the dongle was broken or obsolete, along with video games,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   distributed in formats that have become obsolete.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Oh!
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   And which require the original media or hardware as a condition of access.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   That means emulators.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   That means a ROM would be legal, right?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   If the distributed format has become obsolete.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   It's the scariest sound I've ever seen.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   And the original media or hardware is a condition of access.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   That would be.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   So if I had a Galaxian ROM, I can't...
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   What defines it as obsolete?
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Does obsolete mean you can't find the hardware or that it's no longer produced new anymore?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   I believe it's just the new part.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   I'll give you the...
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   You can't buy it.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   If I gave you the whatever the ROM chip for a Galaxian game and said here.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   I'll volunteer to call the copyright office and ask them and see what they said.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   This is Mr. Mame.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   And I've been writing this program.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   I think that that's what that says.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   I'm just...
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   We need to get to Corey Dott's row.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   They're getting some...
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   I love R's technical.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Have they not become a good news site?
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   What happened there?
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   I mean they're like wired news all of a sudden.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   You've regheped them.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   I see them all over the place now.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   They're smart.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   What's this weekend Google?
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   They've got some very talented people.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Everybody's doing this weekend.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   I just thought I was really crazy.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   They're in depth, like especially like when they're processor and hardware.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   They speak in Google.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Oh, so Martin's...
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Okay, so Martin's gonna do his podcast on revision 3.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   So the name of the show is gonna be called...
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   It's gonna be called something to do.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   It's got the word infected in it.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   But he was thinking I would have named it this week.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   The Puss Chronicles.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   This week and like...
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   This week and then...
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   No, no, no.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   How about this week about tech?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   And what's it's damn for?
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   I already went through all of that before.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   No, but you know.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   I know.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   I know.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   So, uh...
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   So he's gonna...
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   So pop that guy's gonna publish through referee?
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Yes.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   That's great.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   We'll bring him up here for crying out loud.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   He should come off.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   He was up here last week.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   No, no, no.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   No, he wasn't.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   He wasn't up here.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   He wasn't up here but on Friday.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   And then Saturday it was down there.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   He was up there.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   I'm what?
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   He was down there for the big equities.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   He was down there for the big equities.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   You know.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   You're wrong.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   We want Marty to be here.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   And he can wear his slippers.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   It's okay.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   He doesn't have to sober up.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   He doesn't have to sober up.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Is that his big thing?
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Wasn't he...
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Didn't he used to do that at the bar?
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   No, you're gonna ruin his reputation if you tell people he plays script.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   No, he went and used to go to a bar.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Bar dice.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   That's what he's...
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   What was the bar he always used to go to?
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Which one?
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Up town.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Up town.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   That's not a bar.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   That's a lifestyle.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.400]   I have to say though, the graphic and Sarge world, that picture of him at the bar is the greatest
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.400]   picture.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   Was that posed?
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   What's the story with that?
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   I think Joey took it.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:28.240]   Was there a photo shoot or he was just there and Joey got the shot?
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.000]   I think they said that guy.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.800]   I mean, the old guy to his right?
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   I mean, I love that guy.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   Can you get his address?
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   No, it's a great picture.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   Show him so they can...
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   I don't know if you can get that picture of him.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   That's really upgrading the video.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   Do you think that's candid?
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   It could have done a photo shoot.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   They say, "Okay, Martin, don't shave for a few days.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   Look hungover.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   And we'll get a guy from Central Catholic.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   Look at this guy.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.800]   Look at this guy.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   Look at this guy.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   I know.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   It looks like a long shirt.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   Isn't he great?
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   It's just great.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   It looks like Martin did a great picture.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   He's fired from his job.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   I don't know what he's doing.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.800]   Maybe he...
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.800]   Is that the arsenal?
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   He wrote me a note saying it wasn't fired.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.800]   Okay, so don't...
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.800]   Not with the F word.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   Okay.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.800]   He's very sensitive.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:13.800]   He was...
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   He was showing his cancel and he had an office for quite a while at G4.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.800]   Yeah, and he was like, "Because he didn't have to go."
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   Right.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   He was under contract.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   So, let's get Marty on the show.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   Because there are a couple of people who people are begging to have on Twitch.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   One is Marty, one is Megan, one is Kate.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   We could do that.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   Let's thank the folks at AOL Radio for hosting our last Twitch.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   AOL Music Time.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   And this Twitch may also be my last Twitch.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   The last Twitch ever.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   Anything else?
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   You're shutting down.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   So, I guess we're over.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   I know I'm holding.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.800]   I mean, I haven't clicked the buzz in there.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   I've been pushing the turn off.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.800]   I've been pushing the turn off.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   It hasn't actually clicked it.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.800]   Are you doing the digital media expo?
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   No.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.800]   You know?
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.800]   The portable media.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   Oh, we should mention that.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   In fact, you're all invited to be down there in Ontario.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   Can you come to every club?
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   I can.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.800]   I'm going to be there for Al and Far East.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.800]   But I called them up to get a press pass and they said, "Well..."
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   You know, Alex can fill in for us.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   They said, "Well, I don't know."
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.800]   Alex is going to go.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.800]   I was just going to give me the name off.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   I'll talk to you.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   This whole story is like, "Well, you know, I do the show.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.800]   Our company does dictation.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.800]   We do a bunch of stuff with Twitch."
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   In fact, you know what?
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   He says, "Well, if you give me a shout out on Twitch, I'll get you a press pass."
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.800]   What's his name?
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   Tim Perkins.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   No, no, no, no.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.800]   I said I would.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   We're doing Twitch from the show for you.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.800]   I know, I know, but the thing, it's funny that I had to say all this, "Okay, okay, we'll
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   give you a press pass."
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.800]   Anyway, you have the podcast Expo where we're going to do Twitch Live.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   There's Saturday, November 13th in Ontario.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   Alex will just fill in for Kevin.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:43.800]   I'll do their for you.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.800]   That's cool.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.800]   Put a black one.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.800]   Can you save the night suit form with the glittery shoulders?
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:49.800]   Yes.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.800]   I'll take it.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   Are you going to come down, Roger?
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   I will see.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   I do not know you.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   I thought, David, are you going to come down?
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   It's just going to be me.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   I'm supposed to.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   You're supposed to.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   Oh, now my wife knows.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.800]   Yeah, all right.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.800]   You're on your way to Baja.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.800]   Well...
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:04.800]   It's on the way to Baja.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   Yeah, we'll talk about that later.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   Robert, you're coming, right?
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   Oh, never mind.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.800]   I'll tell you later.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   This one.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   This one.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:29.800]   Oh, did you hear a **** pregnant?
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   This is a chime.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.800]   Excellent.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   Is she going to have a litter under the porch?
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:37.800]   What?
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.800]   A **** pregnant?
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:39.800]   With a baby?
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800]   Yes.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   Is there a man in the picture?
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.800]   It's Yoshi's.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   Oh my God.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.800]   Stop.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   Okay.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   Yoshi's had a baby.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   Yoshi had a baby.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.800]   Yes, little baby boy.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.800]   And his name is Baby Cruz.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.800]   Oh, there's his wife.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:00.800]   Baby Cruz.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:04.800]   I don't know if we can post this on the show.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.800]   The wife's doing well.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.800]   Nine pounds, five ounces.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   Let's send an email to Yoshi.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   What do you mean?
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.800]   What blue screens like forget it.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   I'm killing you.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:22.800]   [Music]
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.800]   So **** pregnant.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   David, tell me that.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.800]   I did not tell you that.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.800]   You did.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.800]   David, I just put it in there.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:30.800]   That's a no.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   Please, I'm going to say that.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   Did you hear that?
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.800]   No, we don't want to say that unless it's true.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:36.800]   No, you did not tell you.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   It is true though, right?
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   Someone else told me.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   It's my soul.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   This is crap.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   Did you hear what Dave said?
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.800]   He said, "Thru period?"
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.800]   This is only getting jealous.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.800]   No, but I did not tell you because someone else told me and I think it was you who told me.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.800]   Hey, how?
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   We want to congratulate Yoshi and anybody who might be pregnant.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.800]   Anybody who might be pregnant.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.800]   That's fun.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   She's not lying.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   Should I ask her?
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   She ain't lying?
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.800]   Ask her to me.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:00.800]   We can get a conversation.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.800]   We can get a conversation of her.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:02.800]   I am.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   Oh my.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.800]   Oh my.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   This is actually my first.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.800]   It's a twin first.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:07.800]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   This is our fit to be you on the iTunes.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.800]   It's the music store list.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   DLT doesn't have the dirt.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:15.800]   DLT doesn't have the dirt.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.800]   That's what happens when you get desperate for ratings.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   You go low.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   You go low.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   You go low.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   You go low.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   You go low.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   You go low.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   You go low.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.800]   You go low.
