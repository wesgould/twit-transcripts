[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.200]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.800]   The show that covers the week's Tech News.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.560]   And we've got a great panel to talk about a lot of stuff.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.760]   Let's start to my left.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.400]   Mr. Brian Brushwood of Scam School.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.880]   Did you see that?
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.240]   What?
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.280]   Dude, that was me swallowing my drink just
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.640]   with half a second to spare before you tossed to me.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.520]   At least you weren't chewing steak or something.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.320]   Has that happened?
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.040]   Me.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.440]   Happens all the time.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.960]   I'm eating it.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.800]   I'm always eating.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.080]   Don't you know that?
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.800]   I got to keep my weight up.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.640]   That's awesome, man.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.440]   Have you been Leo?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.000]   I'm well.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.520]   I saw you, though, not so long ago.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.040]   Yeah, dude.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.200]   We covered the PS4 event, which I'm sure
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   we're going to talk about here.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.920]   It's got a lot of implications as far as not only
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.800]   with video games, but the way we consume media
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.560]   and all the social aspects of it as well.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.680]   Yeah, shwood.com is his website.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.680]   And of course, he hosts NSFW as well.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.080]   With Justin Robert Young right here on this very network.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.240]   Also with us.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.400]   Let's go all the way to the right,
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.720]   because from Barcelona, where the mobile world congress
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.440]   is about to get underway tomorrow,
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.080]   we've got the parapetetic Mike Elgin.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   That's a big word.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.840]   I have to look that up here.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.360]   A parapatetic.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.240]   You are parapatetic.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.880]   Well, the last time we talked to you in Kenya,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.360]   the time before that you were in Greece, you are a parapatetic.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.880]   That is true and loving every minute of it.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.600]   Yeah, I've been in Barcelona now for three weeks.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.840]   So this is the great thing about living as a nomad
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.400]   when there's a show like Mobile World Congress
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.520]   I can actually move to the city.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.280]   So we'll be here another weekend and we're off to Valencia.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.240]   But yeah, the show I went to the media event today.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.120]   And it's going to be a really cool show.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.720]   Well, it's really good to have you here.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.880]   And we will be talking about Mobile World Congress as well.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.480]   Also joining us, Andy Enochko from Mac Break Weekly
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.440]   in the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.840]   Hi, Andy.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.280]   Getting ready for the Oscars I see?
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.720]   Yeah, mostly with this backdrop.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.360]   Believe it or not, though, I feel I know
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.240]   that the first half hour is red carpet stuff,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.680]   which I'm never interested in.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.280]   The second half hour is going to be Seth MacFarlane.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.520]   And that's when you're overlapping that with episode
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.000]   two of the Amazing Race.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.320]   OK, I'm going to be watching the Amazing Race.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.200]   Oh my god.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.000]   Switch right over to switch it right over to the Oscars.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.880]   You guys are adorable with all your real time TV watching.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.800]   This is awesome.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   Nobody wants to be in this place.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.000]   You don't watch the Oscars after the fact.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.560]   I wish that the Oscars were worth downloading illegally.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.880]   The Oscars is now at the point where you no longer
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.480]   have Jack Nicholson there in the front row.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.680]   You never-- you no longer have Godfather 2 up for an Oscar.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.400]   It's no longer worth even storing it on your DVR,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.440]   much less downloading your Times Shift together.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.400]   I just want to-- I just want to--
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.800]   like spinal tap at that Air Force base.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.040]   Let's get the Oscars on.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.240]   Let's get it off as quickly as possible.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.360]   Let's just move on.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.880]   Wow.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.160]   Actually, the only reason that the Oscars be live
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.840]   is because it's a social media event.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.520]   It's to jump into the Twitter snark and the whole social stream
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.440]   of making nasty comments about various things.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.360]   I'm also interested to see if Seth McFarley gets himself
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.200]   in trouble or not.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.000]   He is the man behind Family Guy and Ted.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.720]   I guess he's now in movies so that he can host the Oscars
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.200]   ceremony.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.800]   The thing is, he's the sort of very shrewd business.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.280]   Yes, I'm edgy and antsy and out there,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.600]   so long as I don't screw up my deal with Fox,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.920]   the direct and feature film after this Family Guy.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.040]   But yeah, I've learned that I can say bad things about these five
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.680]   groups of people without bad mail.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.320]   And so I'm really going to stick it to those five groups of people.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.160]   Well, there you have it.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.040]   There's our Oscar coverage.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.440]   We're done.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.040]   That's it.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.000]   But we will be done in time to get to the red carpet.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Hey, I wanted to mention something.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.280]   We have a large and diverse community,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.360]   and we love our community.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.760]   It really is what keeps this show going, and all of our shows.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.520]   And we love you all.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.880]   Last year, we had a guy who was very active, very much
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.360]   part of the community.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.840]   Steve Lauren, his chat handle was Stephen 3X.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.160]   And he was just really great.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160]   We had him in the regular in game on,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.680]   and he was a regular in the land party,
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.160]   and we heard a lot from him right, Chad?
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.000]   I mean, he was--
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.680]   And he just disappeared in May of last year off the face
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.080]   of the Earth.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.320]   We just didn't hear from him.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.560]   And that happens from time to time.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.680]   People get busy in life where they get tired of us and move on.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.920]   But we found out recently, Dan and our chat remar,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.760]   a chat mod told me that Stephen had passed away on May--
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.120]   it was May 15.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.520]   And so his last tweet was just the day before.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.360]   It was very sudden.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.960]   He was a young man, 42.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.520]   And we found his brick.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.880]   Actually, this is a picture he took of his brick, Stephen 3X.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.320]   So I just wanted to mention Stephen 3X and acknowledge him.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.920]   I'm sure we've had other members of our community pass away.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.480]   There's so many of you.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.640]   But we just really care a lot of everybody.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.880]   So we're thinking of you, Stephen, wherever you are.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.160]   And we thank you.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.640]   And we miss you.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.200]   And it kind of explains what happened.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.080]   He just disappeared.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.560]   And we never really knew.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.760]   So do us a favor.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.000]   If you're going to die, just let us know so we can say something.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.120]   How about we do this?
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.360]   How about you do Mia favor?
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.880]   And if you're going to drop a death notice on me,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.680]   maybe before the show a little heads up,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.360]   Stephen 3X was one of the folks I always noticed in the chat room
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.200]   while we're doing--
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.720]   Right.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.080]   --draming on live.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.600]   This is the first time hearing about this.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.000]   I know.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.160]   Well, I was shocked too.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.480]   I just found out about yesterday.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.280]   I didn't mean to--
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.520]   I forgot, of course, Brian, you would
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.600]   have had a relationship with him.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.000]   And he was one of the folks who sort of stepped out
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.080]   of just the chat room and helped.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.200]   I mean, he helped us put together land parties.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.320]   He was a big, big help.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.080]   Now, Brian's prepared.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.880]   Brian has a website.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.160]   Do you still do this afterlife.me?
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.720]   Oh, you know what?
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.640]   Patrick Delahanty, P. Delahanty in the chat,
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.560]   is the web wizard.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.640]   I'm just the idea guy who waves his hands and say,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.200]   I got a vision to make someone a virtual ghost
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.080]   and continue to essentially post previous tweets forever
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.600]   if you don't hit a dead man switch.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.120]   And the idea is, all this talk about, like, oh, when you
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.640]   pass away, you have to clean up your digital profiles.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.560]   There's nothing you can do.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.520]   It's done.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.160]   Well, exactly.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   I want the opposite.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.640]   I want to cause more chaos and messed up up because--
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.320]   Why is it ghost?
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:18.480]   Because it goes--
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.400]   Like the guy in Demon.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:19.840]   You want to--
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.200]   Yes.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.400]   --the game developer in Demon who ended up
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.160]   causing a lot of problems.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.920]   Well, thinking of like actual ghosts,
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.080]   if such a thing existed, are basically
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.680]   go around doing their daily stuff over and over and over again.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.000]   Like, they didn't even know they were dead.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.720]   And so the idea with afterlife me was that when you croak,
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.800]   your ghost profile continues to tweet the kind of things
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.720]   that you tweeted when you were alive.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   And it's like nobody bothered to tell you that you're dead.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.440]   And the problem was, shortly after announcing it,
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.120]   Twitter got, like, way restrictive on their API use.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.440]   And you had to be an approved partner.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.200]   And they had to like your idea.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.760]   And so that sort of slowed development on it.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.040]   But I assume that you asked because of some of the other news
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.400]   that's related to this, right?
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.360]   Well, go ahead.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:00.840]   I mean--
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.360]   I don't know it.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:01.960]   That's a high-quality source.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.600]   The loss of a Twitter client, one of our Twitter clients,
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.200]   is dead because they reached the 100,000 user mark.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.680]   And that's it.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.800]   You can't add any more users?
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.720]   Is that the one you're thinking about?
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.200]   Yes, well, that certainly happened.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.320]   But I also saw some news.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.840]   There was a couple of feature articles
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.760]   that people had sent over to me that were similar ideas
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.400]   to what we were doing with afterlife.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.680]   They were probably all delicate and appropriate
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.440]   and didn't make a mockery of death.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.800]   Next time would you put afterlife.me on Squarespace?
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.360]   Because it's dead.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.120]   The site is dead, which doesn't bode well for Brian Brushwood.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.480]   No.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.640]   So the idea this would stop tweeting after you pass
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.480]   or start tweeting after you pass.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.960]   It would start retweeting everything you said in life.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.360]   As if you were still around.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.760]   Yeah, still doing the same thing.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.080]   Picking up the kids, Johnny was bad today.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.120]   You know, the kind of things you would expect a ghost to say
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.000]   is the wind of the wind of the wind.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.520]   He never died.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.440]   Like everything else, this is another example
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.800]   of how William Gibson predicted exactly what would happen.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:05.200]   In the 1984 cyberpunk fiction novel, "Nurmancer,"
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.440]   he had this exact same scenario.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.600]   The idea was that online chat used realistic avatars
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.960]   and he used artificial intelligence.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.760]   So as you were using it, it would kind of half
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.920]   use your real chatting and half use
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.360]   artificially intelligent computer generated chatting.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.880]   And then somebody died and the software didn't know it
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.520]   and just kept on chatting with all the guys friends.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.880]   Well, it's my deep hope that by the time I pass on,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.400]   there'll be enough video extant of me
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.800]   and they'll software will exist that
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.600]   could take every possible word, every possible inflection
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.000]   and just make a simulacrum.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.040]   Because really, I say the same things over and over
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.600]   for the last eight years.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.560]   So do we all.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.120]   This is what's great is we exist as a feedback loop.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.000]   Like who we are determines what we do determines who we are.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.840]   And so we tend to have material.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.240]   We tend to have predictable responses.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   If you're going to tell me about a new tax on internet software.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.480]   I tell them the same story.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.080]   My guess is you guys will know how I'm going to respond on this,
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.600]   right?
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.320]   So at some point, you could have an algorithm that distills
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.000]   and figures out before you even know what it is you're
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.120]   going to think about certain things.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.720]   Hey, if Tupac can give a concert.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.360]   I do a hologram leo hosting Twitter.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.640]   I could host to it.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.040]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.200]   Heppersghost.com for the afterlife needs.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.160]   There you go.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:26.960]   There you go.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.240]   I just I just imagine like people signing up
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.360]   seeing like a link to a service like this on Boeing Boeing
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.800]   is like, oh, ha ha look isn't that funny.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.160]   And like I signed up for always an interesting.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.200]   And then you know, they they they forget all about it.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.800]   And then two years later, they're hit by a bus.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.240]   And now like all their friends, all their family who are brought
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.280]   just on the edge of falling apart because you got taken away
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.440]   from them so cool so soon.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.960]   Like, oh, who is this who's now tweeting under this?
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.920]   Are you really doing this?
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.800]   Like, I don't like I need this.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.840]   Brian, you're a magician, but you don't do the big stage magic.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.520]   But did you have you ever done Peppersghost?
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.440]   We have, you know, obviously very few.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.840]   It's it's not practical for most magicians.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.480]   It requires a big stage.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.440]   It has to do with like a one way mirror and it's very complicated.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.480]   Well, this is the beauty is that simplicity now
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.200]   requires a big pane of glass.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.600]   And if you take a pane of glass, hold it set up at 45 degrees.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.720]   And you have one object on one side of the glass.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.520]   And another one, 90 degree angle.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.720]   And then you just change the lighting.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.640]   You bring the lighting down on one and the lighting up on the other.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.600]   And you go from seeing the actual object through the glass
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.280]   to seeing the reflection of the object next to it.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.400]   It's how the haunted castle works at Disney World.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.360]   So it's like, as you go and you see all the dancing ghosts
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.560]   swirling around, that's that's the biggest Peppersghost
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.680]   illusion I've seen, where all of those
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.480]   are physical objects spinning around underneath you
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.280]   because it's just angled to reflect back the ghosts underneath.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.360]   Same way a teleprompter works.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.320]   Yes, exactly.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.880]   Yes.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.280]   Two different ways of sending a lies into an audience.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.800]   Haunted Mansion.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.960]   Hey, there is so much to talk about.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.320]   There's a PlayStation 4.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   We'll talk about that.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.520]   There's some mobile phone news in advance of mobile world
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.960]   Congress, but there's also some stuff
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.000]   we think will be coming out of MWC.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.520]   Samsung already tipped its hat on a couple of things.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.120]   Google is really pushing some new products.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.960]   Project Glass, yes, but also the Pixel, really?
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.640]   We'll talk about that.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.400]   This is going to be a good show today.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.040]   So stick around.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.960]   But first, I want to introduce a brand new sponsor.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.520]   You all--
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.840]   Brian, you wear glasses.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.320]   I wear glasses a little more in context right now.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.040]   Andy, do you wear glasses, right?
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.720]   I wear glasses if I'm going to be using my computer all day
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   long.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.200]   That's legally required to use them.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.640]   I just wear them to look cool.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.200]   I want to tell you about a new startup called Warby Parker.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.320]   Have you ever heard of Warby Parker?
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:52.760]   So--
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.320]   I have not.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.280]   And I'm fascinated with how savvy their launch campaign is
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:56.800]   because it's like--
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.120]   It's really cool.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.640]   They get the idea that the internet world is super connected
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.480]   and open to the idea of a new player in a long standing--
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.400]   Well, I'm not going to name names,
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.840]   but there is one company that dominates eyeglasses
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   and eyeglass frames.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.280]   And by their monopoly-- or near monopoly, I think it's 80%.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.120]   They've managed to bring the prices up.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.360]   Last pair of glasses I got frames and lenses was 600 bucks.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.280]   Oh, geez.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.680]   It's crazy.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.800]   Warby Parker, we're talking great designer eyewear starting
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.240]   at $95, including the prescription lens.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.480]   They have a titanium-- oh, and I love this.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.640]   The Buy a Pair Give a Pair, where for every pair purchase,
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.360]   a pair is distributed to somebody in need.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.160]   This is like that-- Tom's shoes did this.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.800]   I love this idea.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.480]   So they're really helping people with this, too.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.280]   And you might say, well, I'm not going to order glasses online
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.400]   because I want to try them on.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.280]   They've figured that out, too.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.200]   This is the Warby Parker try-on kit.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.400]   So what you do is you go to Warby Parker.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.880]   I'll show you actually what I did.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.440]   First, you can do a virtual try-on, which is kind of cool.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.000]   So if you see a pair of frames you like, I'll just--
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.880]   let's skip that.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.200]   And I'll look at a pair of frames here.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.520]   I bought some sunglasses here, which I'll show you in a second.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.560]   But let's say I'm interested in these Benson.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.120]   I can do the virtual try-on.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   Now, what I did is I took a picture of myself
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.040]   and I can actually apply the glasses to a picture of myself
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.280]   to see how they look.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   And you get to--
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.800]   They were able to do it at an angle?
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.320]   Well, no, I took-- they give you two pictures.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   And you could try all the-- but now, you use this merely,
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.920]   in my opinion, you say, OK, let's say I like this,
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.480]   which I don't.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.720]   But let's say I like that look.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.960]   Now, I'm going to add that to my home try-on.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.480]   I click that button here.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.560]   And then-- so we did this.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.840]   And I got a home try-on kits.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.280]   Let me show you what it looks like.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.720]   So this comes to you in the mail.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.880]   This is free.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.680]   This is the starting point.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.240]   You have, I don't know, a few days to try these on.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.240]   And so you try the different glasses on
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.280]   until you find one you like.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.960]   And then you send the box back.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.360]   They pay the shipping.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.720]   And you get the pair of glasses.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.560]   And these are my sunglasses.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.640]   These are prescription shades.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.000]   95 bucks.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.760]   If you want to do-- they have some high-end titanium
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.080]   collection, started $145 with premium Japanese titanium,
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.360]   French non-rocking screws.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.120]   I don't know what that is, but I hear it's good.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.200]   All glasses include anti-reflective anti-glare coating,
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.480]   a beautiful case.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.000]   I mean, they came in this gorgeous case
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.960]   with a eyeglass cleaner and all that beautiful case.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.240]   So you're not-- I mean, this is an amazing deal.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.480]   And the truth is, this is what glasses should cost
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.360]   when they're done right.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.000]   Now, I'm going to show you what I'm getting next.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   They have a monocle.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   What?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.160]   I want to get--
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.880]   The Colonel Monocle.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.560]   You're already in my doctor eating a cup.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.040]   I don't know what a lot of people can rock.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.520]   It's going to help your image.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.400]   Don't you think-- now, maybe I need the mustache too.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.240]   I don't know.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.080]   Do you even need the mustache?
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.120]   Is that Joshua Topolsky?
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.240]   I think it is.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.720]   So I don't know.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.480]   I just--
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.400]   The big risk is that if you walk into a restaurant
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.960]   and you tip anything less than 20% with a monocle on,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.080]   oh boy, are you going to get spat on on your way out?
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.200]   All glasses include the case, the coating, the cleaning cloth,
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.800]   no additional costs, no additional items
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.880]   you need to purchase.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.120]   You could try them for free with a home try on Warbparker.com,
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.480]   W-A-R-B-Y, P-A-R-K-E-R.com.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.840]   You get the special frame box prepaid shipping label
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.480]   for easy return.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.000]   I think this is a really great idea.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.080]   If you're ready to get some new glasses--
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.480]   by the way, they just call my eye doctor
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.680]   and got the prescription.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.440]   So that was simple.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.680]   But they also sell clear ones if you
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.760]   don't need a prescription, but you want to get some nice shades.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.600]   These are polarized sunglasses.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.280]   I'm going to keep these in the car
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.240]   because my regular glasses are transitions, which
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.400]   don't darken when you're in a car, which means them completely
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.840]   useless.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.920]   So I'm just taking them off and I'll put these on.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.400]   W-A-R-B-Y-P-A-R-K-E-R.com.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.760]   Use the offer code TWIT, by the way,
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.480]   when you buy for free expedited delivery.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.640]   Warbparker.com.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.520]   Use the offer code TWIT on checkout,
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.120]   if you would, so that we get credit.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.280]   So now that the ad is 100% over, we're back to content.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.640]   Isn't there rumors that those guys were going
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.040]   to be associated with the Google Glass?
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.480]   It's not in their ad.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.640]   But I heard that rumor, too, that Google is saying,
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.600]   we understand these are dorky.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.000]   I don't think that's the exact language that you used.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.680]   I don't think they said that, but I think it's right.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.880]   And so we're going to get some stylish ones.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.560]   And the rumor was it were Warby Parker as a startup.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.040]   It would make sense, an entrepreneurial startup
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.600]   that they would be the ones tapped.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.240]   And that's what the rumor was.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.960]   So you've heard the name before?
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.080]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.200]   I'm excited to see how they do, because we've seen other companies
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.560]   come in and do a savvy campaign to hit the internet crowd
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.120]   before, and it's worked well from them.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.760]   And so I hope to hear the same thing about Warby Parker.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.040]   Dario Strange writing about that in PC Magazine.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.800]   So there you go.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.640]   There's an alternative to them just helping with the design,
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.280]   which is that you go and order your glasses,
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.960]   and you pick them through the same process.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.240]   And then you click a checkbox.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.160]   It says-- Exactly.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.240]   Go ahead and add the Google Glass.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.720]   Add Google Glass.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.160]   Exactly.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.000]   $100.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Let's talk about Glass.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.160]   Because I was perhaps a little outspoken
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.720]   on this week in Google this week.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.640]   I just started to think this is such a stupid idea.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.840]   Oh, no, it isn't.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.280]   OK.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.080]   I'm waiting for you to talk me down, Andy.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.200]   I'm saying as a $500 device that they're
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.120]   trying to sell 5 million copies of, yeah, it's a stupid device.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.680]   As a-- hopefully, the price will come down
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.480]   to a reasonable $1,000, he said, oh, ha, ha.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.920]   It's a cool item.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.480]   The video that they released this week,
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.640]   which the Verge said was pretty much the real deal
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.480]   when you're actually wearing it.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.560]   Because Joshua got to wear him.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.360]   He got to go to the Google office.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.880]   Incidentally, I wonder if he just
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.600]   like his heart just like skipped three beats as he realized.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.160]   As every single tech journalist in the world
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.560]   suddenly started hating him for exactly three and a half minutes
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.520]   for that kind of jealousy has to have sort of a feedback
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   loop to it.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.040]   But it was--
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.480]   Oh, I was going to say, there was kind of a magic moment.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.480]   If you watch that video from the Verge,
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.080]   there's this moment when he has the glasses on.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.400]   And he's like, they're talking about adjusting the display.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.560]   He's like, no, no, no, yeah, I get it.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.040]   I see it.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.120]   It says OK Glass 325.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.320]   And then all of a sudden, there's this moment he freezes.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.040]   And it's clear like he realizes that just by casually
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.280]   saying OK Glass, he accidentally triggered it.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.480]   And Google Glass asked him what he wanted to do.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.640]   And he's like, take a video.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.800]   And then it cuts to the high quality video
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.160]   that he's taking from the quality of the recording.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.000]   What I thought was exceptional from what I had expected it to be.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.640]   Here's the video that Andy was talking about.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.600]   This is the video I think you were talking about, Andy,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.120]   which is from Google how it looks through Glass.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.440]   This is the first time we've seen the Glass UI.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.360]   What Google has to do is make you realize how your life hopefully
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.280]   would be enhanced by having this sort of device.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.960]   And it has to be better than shooting first person video of you
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.720]   on a roller coaster.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.960]   I agree because everything's taken from the advantage point
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.000]   of your upper--
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   your right eyebrow, which is--
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.760]   I mean, I have a pair of glasses that take video.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.640]   What's the big deal with that?
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.440]   But the successful stuff is when you have the sort of--
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.440]   Josh's video, you're just walking down the sidewalk.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.440]   And you wish you didn't have to take your phone out of your pocket
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.560]   to find out, do I take this left or the left that's coming up
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.520]   in about two blocks?
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.960]   I don't know which one it is.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.120]   These little micro moments where you have to take your phone
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.800]   out of your pocket, even if you had a smart watch,
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.440]   you'd have to pull up your sleeve and look at your watch.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.000]   But Andy, is that worth $1,500 and looking like a dork?
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.520]   So OK, so here's the thing.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.360]   The people who be willing to spend $1,500 for that
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.880]   don't care about looking like a dork.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.160]   They would enjoy being immersed in this technology.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.160]   Here's what I wanted to--
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.880]   So here's what I'm reminded of, the segue.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.120]   Everybody thought, oh, this is so cool.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.000]   You just lean and it goes in the right direction.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.840]   And what they didn't count on is when you get on it,
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.280]   you look like the most idiotic person in the world,
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.840]   because you're eight feet tall on giant wheels,
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.640]   and it killed the segue purely because of the dork.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.160]   That's the perfect example.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.160]   That's the perfect example.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.920]   Because remember, before it shipped,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.760]   before the segue shipped, everybody
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.160]   was talking about how they were going to redesign cities.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.600]   Right.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.560]   It was going to transform human culture.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.280]   And when it came out, it's like, well, dork,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.440]   it's just a dork thing.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.360]   And it's sort of like, it is cool.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.920]   It's a cool technology that hardly anybody uses.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.360]   And I think to a certain extent, glass
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.080]   is going to be like that.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.600]   Here's the two things you guys have missed.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.120]   Number one, who this is going to appeal to the most
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.840]   are people who are not going to wear it in public,
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.920]   but instead, right now--
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.920]   Great.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.760]   When I am riding my bike, I go on these 25 miles bike rides.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.440]   And when I get a--
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.960]   Get a GoPro Hero and man it on your handlebars,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.960]   it'll be better.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.960]   No, no, no, no, no, I'm not talking about it.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.000]   I'm not talking about it when I receive an incoming message.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.120]   I, while I'm pedaling dangerously on the side of the highway,
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.240]   I pull out my phone, and I'm sort of half riding one-handed
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.600]   reading and trying to tap a message back out.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.080]   It's like, of course, it makes perfect sense
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.480]   when I'm riding a bike with that.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.400]   If you want to talk about the video aspect,
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.160]   where this is-- the video they can't make
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.400]   is the video of how somebody was wearing Google Glass
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.840]   and managed to capture the police beating they took
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.360]   outside of the G8 Summit.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.440]   With these riots, with these--
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.520]   this is where it truly matters, because you wear a Google
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.360]   Glass, you are making a statement about your visibility
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.200]   to the world for what's about to happen with public officials.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   And I think that as a countercultural measure,
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.360]   it will become a fashion icon there.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.640]   But it's the same statement you make when you hold your camera
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.280]   phone up in people's faces--
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.320]   No, it doesn't because--
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.440]   --as you're talking to the measure walking around.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.160]   It's the same-- the camera in somebody's face.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.560]   The difference is you can't make that statement all the time.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.080]   It's not practical to be making that statement all the time.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.640]   You don't walk around and have civil discourse
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.840]   while holding a camera up.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.200]   Instead, you have that awkward moment of fumbling out
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:00.560]   or whatever.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.560]   And the--
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.160]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.520]   Because it's socially unacceptable to have a camera
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.040]   in people's face all the time, which is precisely why these things
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.480]   aren't going to gain widespread consumer appeal.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.880]   You're going to have a camera in everybody's face
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.480]   all the time you're talking to them, and people won't like you.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.440]   I think that's the--
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.360]   Andy, Andy, go ahead.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.920]   That's why when I wrote about it a few days ago, I say,
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.400]   we're going to have to make an amendment to the social contract
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.800]   that says that I'm not being a jerk.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.200]   If I tell you to please take those glasses off
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.160]   during any sort of social construct.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.040]   But I paid $1,500 for those glasses.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:35.560]   Right.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.840]   And I won't know what weather--
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.680]   --the weather is or what time it is if I'm not wearing them.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.840]   How dare you?
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.440]   Then you can definitely pick up the check for dinner.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.360]   I mean, I think that as a first--
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.760]   what Google has a unique opportunity
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.440]   in that they don't have to make this
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.120]   into a successful commercial product with the first launch.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.280]   They're making so much money off of their main business
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.000]   that this product really only plugs into and enhances
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.360]   that they can wait for the second or third iteration
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.840]   before, like just like the Kindle first cost an absurd amount,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.640]   money $450.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.680]   But now we're at the point where it costs $60, $60 for 20,000
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.320]   books for free for life.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.520]   So if Google can do that, if there are enough earlier
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.600]   adopters that can survive with the idea of,
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.240]   I'm wearing this dorky thing on my face.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:18.720]   Yes, it will.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.000]   Yes, it costs $1,500.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.200]   Hopefully it'll be less than that.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.440]   And yes, that only has a limited number of features,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.400]   where it can get to the point where maybe instead of buying
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.240]   a new phone this year that I was budgeting $200 for,
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.240]   I'm going to spend that $300 instead on Google Glass,
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.480]   because it's going to enhance my iPhone 6 better
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.080]   than the new features of the iPhone 7
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.320]   will enhance my experiences.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.720]   So there's a choice that you can make.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.840]   And granted, the Google Glass will, by obscuring part
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.040]   of your face and being bulky and clunky or whatever,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.280]   I suspect that Google Glass will be the, in addition
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.520]   to Google Glass, we also have the rumors of the Apple
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.560]   wristwatch thing.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.520]   And when I think about it from a functionality perspective,
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.840]   if I don't care how I look, and instead I just think of what
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.960]   kind of interface would I like with my data,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.240]   the idea of a wristwatch seems so antiquated and so 1950s
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.920]   compared to the idea of an always on heads up display.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.000]   Oh, yes, spectacles.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.200]   That's modern.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   Let's look at glasses.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.040]   What you'll have is the 18th century.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.040]   No, no, because you're not--
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.600]   Apple's going to have a hard time selling people
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.360]   on the idea of, well, what does this screen do
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.360]   that the screen in my pocket doesn't do?
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.280]   Well, it's on your wrist.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   It's on your wrist.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.800]   That you wear.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.840]   OK, but what can I do with this?
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.320]   How will this enhance my life in a way
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   that adding a smartphone to my life changed my life
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:35.600]   and made it quite clear?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.120]   You know what's clear is that the--
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.520]   It's going to justify the use of the wristwatch.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.000]   The Mavens in Silicon Valley have, for whatever reason,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.400]   decided that the next big thing is wearable computing.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.840]   Can we stipulate that?
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.280]   Yes.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:45.780]   Absolutely.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.280]   That's clear.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.920]   I mean, you're seeing the two big companies, Apple and Google,
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.760]   both saying, OK, we know it's going to be wearable.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.360]   And Samsung and HP and--
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.480]   Presumably they're working on it, too?
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.680]   There's a lot of patent filings,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.440]   and there's a lot of production going on there.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.760]   Are they right?
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.080]   I think that they're right to try.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.360]   Everything is going to be a failure
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.000]   until the first wave of technology comes out there,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.760]   and people can react to it.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.280]   The iPad was a success only until the next wave of generation
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.240]   devices came by.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.440]   Well, and Microsoft tried for 10 years before Apple got it.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:21.880]   Right.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.280]   And that showed this is what people were really wanting.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.560]   But also, as soon as the next generation of tablets came by,
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.080]   the tablets that were informed by the iPad,
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.920]   the world suddenly started asking, oh, wait a minute.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.280]   Maybe we didn't really want 10-inch screens.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.440]   Maybe we really wanted seven to eight-inch screens all along.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.200]   And now the entire industry seems to be pivoting
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.240]   towards smaller screens.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.360]   So I think that we need to have that first device out there
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.560]   that really puts that drop of water.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.720]   And now we can see the ripples that occur from that first drop,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.960]   and then they can adjust accordingly.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   I think it's an exciting project.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.600]   More importantly, Apple is really, really good at creating markets.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.680]   I mean, smart watches and heads up displays,
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.600]   and cameras on your glasses, and all these things already exist.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.960]   You can go buy something more or less like what all these things do right now.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.160]   And most people don't do that.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.960]   Apple's really tried a number along, and they're crappy.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.800]   Yeah, they're crappy.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.520]   Apple's really just as media players were crappy before.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.040]   The iPod just said, "The phone's crappy before the iPhone,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.760]   just as tablets are crappy before the iPad."
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.240]   Apple's really good at coming along and creating a device,
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.760]   then marketing the hell out of it, telling its fans,
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.400]   this is the one and only type of device in this category
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.160]   that anybody could ever need.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.920]   And they create the market, and then that opens up a bazillion things.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.360]   I mean, I've made this point in a column over the weekend,
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.040]   which is that with the iPhone, the iPhone isn't about the iPhone.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.080]   The iPhone mainstreamed the idea of a multi-touch device.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.080]   Now, multi-touch devices are everything.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.160]   And Apple started it with the iPhone in terms of mainstream.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.640]   I would submit that.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.280]   That might not be the best example,
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:03.560]   only because the iPhone was preceded by a long, long legacy of smartphones
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   that worked great and provided an immense amount of value for their users.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.000]   Apple just simply said, "Well, what if we base this all around a touchscreen
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.720]   and a better interface and made it more media-focused
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.760]   than focusing it on the thumb pad and pushing email?"
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.600]   This idea of wearable computing is different
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.360]   because it is almost truly unprecedented.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.960]   Now, when we're comparing it to a GoPro or comparing it to some of these
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.080]   little cameras you can buy that are embedded in sunglasses,
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.000]   that's assuming that the killer app for this is first-person video.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.240]   The real killer app is going to be, again,
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.400]   the people who are riding on bicycles and do not want...
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.280]   They need to sort of keep one toe in their electronic life,
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.360]   but they don't want to have to stop and take out a phone unnecessarily.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.600]   Even someone who's just walking down the street
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.160]   who doesn't want to have to take out that phone every now and then
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.600]   just to see what that buzz in their pocket was all about.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.000]   So...
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.560]   Keep in mind also, that brings up another aspect of glass
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.520]   that I think is truly unique in that it's truly private messaging.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.200]   Because even if I send you a text
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.560]   and you're sitting, let's say you're talking to someone
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.920]   and I send you a snarky message about that somebody,
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.360]   you have to pull out the phone,
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.400]   smirk and then set it down.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.240]   All of that telegraphs and all of that matters in that very real social space.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.600]   And this is a way to send specific messages.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.480]   I think there's going to be an extraordinary amount of appeal to people
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.640]   who want to be able to have a secret one-on-one connection
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.280]   with another person to where you literally share your life
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.520]   and nobody else is into the sea.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.480]   Except what he's saying.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.920]   Okay, okay, okay.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.720]   I'll be with you in about 10 minutes.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.640]   I'm just having dinner with this absolute loser
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.520]   that I'm hoping to stick the check with by Sendglass.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.120]   So anyway, I'm telling you, I'm glad that I'm in business with you.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.160]   No, obviously, I'm not sending this.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.080]   You get this, I'm running away.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.120]   Obviously, less private for sending.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.600]   But you understand what I'm saying though.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.360]   The idea of having a one-way conduit that is always on,
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.680]   I think, is extraordinarily valuable to...
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.160]   I think to the majority of people in certain situations.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.200]   I disagree.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.920]   And I think you're making a big deal
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.360]   out of pulling a phone out of your pocket.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.600]   How hard is that? Come on.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.480]   Oh, dude, listen.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.400]   Isn't the wearable computer already here?
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.800]   It's called your smartphone and it's more than adequate.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.560]   No, oh my God! Oh, dude!
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.040]   This...
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.120]   What? Who needs an automobile?
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.520]   My horseless, my carriage works just fine.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.400]   It's not so hard to take it out of your pocket.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.840]   What's so hard about that?
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.680]   We're not talking about calories expended.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.120]   We're talking about, at what point do you have to stop what you're doing
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.440]   and shift your focus away from what you're doing now
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.720]   into another space?
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.640]   Well, apparently, people are doing it all the time.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.040]   You can't walk down the street without seeing everybody
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.320]   buried in their phone.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.760]   That's the other thing.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.160]   What you hate is the fact that for a moment,
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.920]   they are completely offline in the real world.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.600]   But they're going to be that way with Google Glass.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.720]   It's just you're not going to know it.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.000]   Everybody's going to...
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Everybody's going to be looking off to the right.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.600]   Because you won't know, because you will walk down the street
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.080]   and not realize that nobody's paying attention to you.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.120]   What's good about that?
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:53.920]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.200]   It's polite.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.320]   That's the...
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.360]   Google will have failed if that's how people wind up using this device.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.080]   I think that there's a consistent message
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.920]   that Google keeps trying to send with this.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.400]   And that's the way that this is going to succeed or fail.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.280]   If they keep telling you that this is not a way of cutting yourself off
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.600]   from the real world, but a way of becoming more engaged with the real world.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.720]   Because it's a way to share things in the real world
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.880]   with your social circle, with your social net,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.960]   without having to stop, take out your phone,
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.440]   activate the camera...
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.280]   Oh, wait, switch it off of movie mode,
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.720]   put it back into camera mode,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.480]   stand there, look at what you're doing on the screen.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.080]   So many reasons why I was filled with three and a half minutes worth of hatred for Josh.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.000]   One of one is that he stole the Louis Seik CK reference that I put into my piece.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.720]   So I had to pull it and...
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.480]   Oh, no, what do you say?
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.680]   Louis Seik has this great...
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.760]   Has this great fit in his car and act.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.120]   When he talks about how he was at the...
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.000]   He was at a dance recital for one of his daughters.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.840]   And everybody's not watching the daughter,
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.320]   they're looking at the daughter on video on their phone
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.760]   instead of actually watching this.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.640]   That's right.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.040]   And of course he goes on from there, but yeah, there is that point.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.040]   So once...
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:03.520]   As much as I disparaged using this as a first person video camera collection device,
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.560]   part of it is going to be,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.040]   once the price gets down to a certain level,
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.240]   the value add that certain people are going to have to say
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.080]   that I can be able to watch what's going on
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.040]   and capture it and share it with the grand parents
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.200]   and share it with the other people in my circle,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.560]   that's going to be worth...
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.800]   If there's a $500 price tag, they're going to say,
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.720]   "Okay, I would pay $180 worth of that is worth that one feature.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.000]   Let's see if the other feature is total up to $500 or more than $500."
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.960]   To me?
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.640]   Go ahead, Mike.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.560]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:37.840]   Google is currently marketing this thing as a way to capture video
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.760]   from your first person,
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.600]   which is not a very compelling application,
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.800]   but this is the one that you can show in a video commercial.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.400]   The most compelling aspects of this are the kind of Google now,
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.160]   virtual assistant,
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.320]   I'm going to interrupt you and suggest something.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.040]   Here's a little bit of information about the building you're looking at.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.080]   Here's the name of the person you just walked up and started talking to.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.320]   Those are the kinds of things, the artificial intelligence.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.880]   And the cool thing about that is they're being developed
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.640]   for Google Glass, but they'll be usable for all kinds of other things.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.200]   No, I agree with you.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.840]   I think Google now is very interesting.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.440]   I think Google now is in fact,
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.280]   exactly designed exactly because they expect to put it on Glass.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:22.160]   The very practical to the average consumer reason for Google Glass is one thing.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.480]   Never ever have to say, wait, wait, hold on.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.240]   Hold on, hang on, just stay there for a little bit.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.480]   Okay, there we go.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.640]   Like that moment nobody likes.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.480]   And there are enough people who don't like it to the tune of $1,500.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.760]   I think that it's worth it.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.720]   I'm sorry, Brian.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.000]   It's not about photography.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.080]   It's not about photography.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.960]   And the other thing about Google now that I learned recently,
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.800]   I don't know if you guys have talked about this on any of the Android shows,
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:55.920]   but apparently Google now is going to be an interface or the interface for Google's home
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.040]   automation thing called Android at Home.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:05.440]   They actually have cards for individual Google now cards for appliances.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.360]   There's one that showed up in some recent code for controlling lights.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.640]   And so I think where Google is going is this idea where there's a virtual assistant that's
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.520]   always with you through the phone, the computer, the glasses, whatever.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.200]   And you simply talk and it gives you answers and it has agency.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:29.360]   So it does thing, turns off the lights, turn up the heater, did I turn off the, you know, whatever.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.120]   And so I think that's where they're headed.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.680]   It's the bigger picture isn't the glass.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.440]   The bigger picture is this virtual assistant artificial intelligence
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.800]   thing that's tied into search and the knowledge graph and all that stuff.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.920]   That's what's really to me the most exciting thing about all this.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.760]   Although I should point out that Android at Home's first demonstration was the Google Q.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.520]   Which was pulled off the market before they could even sell it.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.200]   And anybody who'd ordered it got a free one.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.560]   And I think anybody who orders a Google glass might get a free one too.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.360]   I would love a free one.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.880]   But I think that this year's Google I/O, we're going to see some pretty amazing home automation.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.360]   I agree.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.080]   Stuff.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.200]   I hope it does take off.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.280]   And I should say I ordered a Google glass.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.400]   I paid, well, they haven't debited my card yet, but I paid $1,500 to get a place in line.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.560]   And I'll certainly wear it.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.080]   But I just don't see average people wearing it.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.840]   I think they're really stretching the case.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.320]   I guess if you think it's something about it's experiment.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.920]   Yes.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.240]   And it's, and obviously nobody thinks it's the end game.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.760]   No, right.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.320]   No.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.800]   And here's the crazy part is no matter what, no matter no matter what happens,
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:49.040]   this demo that we're seeing now that we're all excited about will look utterly ridiculous in 10
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.760]   years, either because it's such a great idea that now we're it's like laughing at the first
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.800]   generation iPod that giant clunky brick or because it was such a terrible idea that it never
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.680]   went anywhere to begin with.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:06.320]   It was like dorky 3D glasses that you have to admire Google because this is where they're really
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.840]   willing to act kind of and they have the money to act kind of in this way with gigabit fiber
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.200]   in Kansas City only, but that would just look what that could do with automated cars, autonomous
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:17.680]   vehicles.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:23.360]   Yeah, it's not here yet, but they're put it they're pushing the envelope forward with glass.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.120]   Understanding that these things are all, you know, now don't make a lot of sense,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.480]   but they are the future.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.400]   And I'm not even convinced Google's doing it for financial game, but I think this is kind of
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.480]   larry and serge are kind of into this stuff.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.840]   It's it's a cool thing and they can do it with the Google the queue.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:43.280]   I mean, the next is queue really demonstrated how little risk that Google takes by introducing
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:43.840]   new products.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.160]   Right.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:50.640]   That would have been a humiliating failure for Apple or Microsoft or Samsung or any other
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.160]   company to make a big splash announced in this product than never actually shipping it because
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.120]   they suddenly realized that it was this was a terrible, terrible idea.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:02.880]   I mean, this is this is every company has its own signature personality, its own quirks about how
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.520]   it operates.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.880]   When the when the when glass was first announced where they're just showing off,
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.600]   here's the design prototype and here I am wearing this mock up and explaining how this
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.560]   thing is going to work.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.200]   It got a lot that Google got rassed a lot for introducing this pie in the sky thing that they
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.160]   don't know what it does yet.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.680]   They don't know if they're going to ship it or not.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.120]   And now they have really just a promise to ship at some point and a video.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.840]   But the fact that they're not like Apple that they're not going to just simply wait until they
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.800]   have something to ship and they know for a fact they're going to start selling these things,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.560]   then that's when you find out about it.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.640]   That they shouldn't really be dinged for that.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   It's it's kind of cool to see them start to play with this device and start to build their
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.160]   own enthusiasm for it.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.960]   And now that we're in 2013 and we're we've been told that Google Glass will ship to consumers by
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.080]   the end of this year.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.160]   It's kind of interesting because it's going to be fun to see what happens when 5,000 people
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.760]   have these and see what they do with them.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.760]   Well, well, and it was pre-saged in an early version of Star Trek with Ensign Wesley
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.000]   Crusher. Here's an early version of Google Glass.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.880]   And he wasn't quite so happy.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.440]   Is it true science fiction did press pre-saged this?
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:17.120]   Keep in mind, of course, that the minds who are designing this stuff grew up in love with
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.320]   science fiction stories.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:18.800]   Exactly.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.520]   Of course, the predictions influence the response.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:27.040]   But to me, even if this is the Apple Newton of Google, then I'm okay with that because that
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.080]   means that in 20 more years, we'll have the iPhone of glasses on your face.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:38.320]   And you can't fault for someone trying to do something so bold and daring and adventurous,
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.760]   and especially when doing the--
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.800]   Well, and doing there are in the public.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.120]   Exactly.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.080]   Well, here's a mind-blower.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.920]   The guy who's the main scientist who's behind Google Glass is also working on contact lenses
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.560]   that do some of this type of thing as well.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.040]   Now you're now you're talking.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.640]   That sounds like that'll totally work.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.080]   I have full confidence in this project.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.880]   That's so safe.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:04.560]   And that brings us right back to William Gibson, who predicted this as well in your mantra.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.800]   Well, we're going to, again, re-writing the social contract.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.600]   Oh, the great-- I think that there's going to be a problem when Google Glass is built into just an
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.520]   invisible option on eyeglass frames.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.080]   I want it to look big and dorky because I want to know if there's someone who's looking at me who
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.480]   might be capturing video of me, not that I'm doing something wrong, but I don't want--
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.040]   I don't want to-- if I know this one was pointing a camera at me, there's a bad--
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.160]   there's a low chance I'm going to be shoving half of a burrito in my mouth
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.920]   when I know I'm being photographed.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.040]   Will there be a red light on it?
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.680]   Well, what will happen is, is we'll enter a new series of social contracts.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:45.280]   If you ever read the Diamond Age, they presuppose the idea that technology reaches a position
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.600]   where people decide how they want to live their lives.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:53.120]   And some decide to live a virtual version of Victorian era values.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:58.000]   And so in order to accomplish certain technological means, they do things like have a parlor room,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.040]   a waiting room where people sit and then they exchange cards and so on.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.000]   So what'll happen is, is we'll see virtual digital assistance to where it's socially acceptable when
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.360]   you all sit down to dinner. No, you're not going to take off your glasses because that'd be dumb.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.800]   So instead, what you all do is you have an app that's installed in everyone's eyeglasses
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.840]   where a virtual butler holds all messages for 30 minutes once every 30 minutes that comes in,
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.600]   interrupts and says, excuse me, I'm sorry to disturb you. Here are some messages that
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.960]   have happened and then they get synchronized up and then we go back. We will adapt to the new reality
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.880]   of social media in a always on 24 hour, virtually directly into your brain environment. And there's
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.840]   no reason that it's necessarily a good or bad thing. Meanwhile, Google announces a $1,300
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:47.120]   Chromebook. The Chromebook Pixel. We thought this was a hoax.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:55.040]   Okay. I'm outside the price or a typo or something. So the Chromebooks predecessor,
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:00.080]   the original Chromebooks were a couple hundred bucks, but they didn't have an i5 processor and
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:06.320]   they certainly didn't have a 4.3 megapixel retina display. It's actually higher resolution than
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.760]   Apple's retina displays touch, even though Chrome OS doesn't particularly support touch.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:23.120]   But it's still $1,300 for 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi laptop. Wasn't the original one $500?
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:28.800]   I mean, it was actually overpriced because it was such a piece of junk.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   Well, this isn't a piece of junk, but it's still running an operating system that consists of
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.840]   no more than a browser. But the original one, the problem with the original one wasn't so much
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.240]   that it was a cloud only device. They've actually got us done some creative work around that.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.520]   It was just that it was a piece of junk. It was crash. It was horrible.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.400]   This is not that. This is a high quality machine with a very high quality display,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:57.680]   apparently. And I think that it's three times the price of the original, but it's 10 times as good.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.880]   I think this is much more compelling than the original, even at this price.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.840]   Then the original Agree, because all the points you've made are completely valid.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:10.560]   When you compare it to the $250 Samsung Chromebook, which is a fantastic device,
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:17.680]   I applaud Google for taking seriously this mandate of putting computing power in the hands of
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.560]   everybody, or at least the people who can afford it at a much lower price point than what you
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:29.280]   would normally have to spend for a laptop of similar quality. It was so surprising to me that
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:36.080]   not just the price tag, but why does a Chromebook need an i5 processor? Why does a Chromebook need
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.640]   a display of this quality? Why does a Chromebook need a touchscreen or this build quality? Why don't
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:46.800]   you extend the battery life? Do it, do it, do a 12.5 inch Chromebook, and give us a better keyboard
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:52.560]   and a better trackpad, but also find a way to make this equivalent of a $900 Intel PC,
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.760]   excuse me, a Windows PC, for like a $500 or $400 price point. And when I was talking to Google
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:04.240]   about this on Thursday, oh boy, I was asking the dumbest questions ever because all of them came down
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:10.720]   to on Wednesday, I didn't believe I lived in a world in which Google would try to sell a $1290
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.560]   dollar Chromebook. And now I don't even know what the name of my mother is right now. I'm so confused.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:21.200]   That's why they do that, Andy. Well, it seems to me that there exists and keep in mind, I am
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.320]   not qualified to talk about this, but that will not stop me because I'm not somebody who believes in,
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:31.200]   you know, putting everything on the cloud. But if you are somebody who really believes in the
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:37.760]   cloud and believes in the Google ecosystem, my guess is it would be embarrassing to be one of these
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:44.320]   high quality evangelists and then pull out this plastic. Yes, piece of junk and be embarrassed of
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:48.640]   your thing. This is a way for them for it to be socially acceptable to set this down right next
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.800]   to somebody's MacBook. And now it's not a difference of quality a build. It's not a difference of
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.480]   quality of processor. It's a difference of philosophy. It's saying, yes, exactly. It's
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.440]   and this is exactly what Google needs, I think. Couldn't you be a better evangelist for Chromebook
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:11.040]   by taking a $1,300 and buying five Samsung Chromebooks? Or and every time someone says,
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.600]   hey, wow, is that a Chromebook? I always want to try one here. Take mine. Because because all my
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.520]   debt is in the cloud, it takes me two keystrokes to absolutely burn all my data off of it. And
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:24.560]   because it's so affordable, I actually have three in the trunk of my car right now. Or I am back
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.720]   book air for the same or less. And just promise, I will only use Chrome.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.920]   That's the disconnect point I had where at a certain price point, I don't understand the
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:40.240]   argument against just buying a regular MacBook or a Windows notebook and then just running web apps
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.640]   through Chrome. I promise maybe it's like maybe it's a lack of my understanding. And I just don't
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:50.000]   know why they did it. And you do have a good point. Part of it is that maybe they really do want to
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.600]   have a prestige level product out there that really does emphatically say, I love Chrome so much,
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:01.520]   I love the Chromebook, I do so much that I wanted the best optimum device quality possible. Maybe
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.960]   Google wanted to say to web developers, here is we will give you the ultimate hardware to write a
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.920]   web target a web app for here it is if you want to create the best web apps possible, you are not
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:17.280]   going to be eliminated by onboard CPU, you're not going to be limited by by speed of input or
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.200]   display. Here is now please make us some stuff that really has to show up Chrome.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:26.960]   It's for the market. I actually think there's a market for this and the market is in the enterprise
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.800]   space executives. There are lots and lots of executives who want something simple and secure
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.920]   and in the cloud. And I've seen so many C-level executives who are so plummoxed.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.560]   This is the CEO's laptop. You're exactly right. You hit the nail on that.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.960]   It's not for you and me. Right. For the monocle crowd.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:57.200]   It's for the monocle crowd to buy for the top tier two glass wearing people.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:01.280]   It does make a statement if you buy this that you have more money than you really know what to do.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.560]   Well, but again, it's and that's of course the base level assessment, but you also have the
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:13.520]   fact that what you're saying is is I demand high quality, I demand high low latency and I
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.760]   believe this can be done in a cloud based service.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:23.520]   We're going to take a break. Come back with more. What a great panel. Lots to talk about.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:30.160]   Mobile World Congress coming up. Windows blue. The HTC one. Is it the best Android phone yet?
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:36.720]   A new couple of new eight inch tablets showing that Apple might have led the way there. And yes,
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:42.640]   we got to talk about the PS4. You're watching Twit with Brian Rushwood, Schwood.com.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:48.720]   And from Vision three scam school. Yeah, and scam stuff.com. Now we got loot. We got bump keys.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.800]   So you can break into your neighbor's house. You're not selling bump keys. Yes, I am.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:58.320]   Isn't that illegal? Oh, nothing's illegal in Texas. Only in it. It's not illegal to sell from Texas.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.000]   There are a few states that we cannot ship to.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:09.120]   Do you sell locks? I got it. Peccing stuff. George, I'll be a bush. And now you're sending it.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.560]   Setting up the block picking tools in the world. I can't have it. I can't have you.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:17.120]   Got the textbook problem. It's like every source of horrible problems. Things we Texas and I'm sick
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:22.000]   of it. And you know, it's great about these bump keys. They're only $9.99. So and we made
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.920]   a premium items there. Like you see, we had a custom art put on those. We wanted them to kind
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.800]   of be status symbols. I'm really a fan of the the Dia de los Muertos design that we got on those.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:36.320]   And of course, you know, we had a maid and I was paranoid that they wouldn't work. So the first
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.120]   thing like I got back from a trip. I walk right past my wife, right past my kids. I grab one of them
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.280]   and I start hammering on my door. And it wasn't until I got it three times in a row that I was
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:52.000]   finally like, all right, we're good. We're good. You are a mad man. Yes. All right. Let's say that.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.240]   All right. The art of scamming with Brian Brushwood also with us from the Chicago Sun
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:03.040]   Times and Mac break weekly Andy Anaco. And from Barcelona, Mike Elgin. Hey, it's great to have you

[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.640]   Yeah. When we launched scam stuff, we did an Indiegogo to fund it. We didn't expect we did
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.160]   triple the amount of interest that we thought we were going to do. And there was this momentary
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.000]   freak out of how we're going to logistically do all of that. And then I asked around, like,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.880]   who should I go with? Who should I go with? And like the universe, like everyone's like,
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:49.120]   do stamps.com offer code TWIT. And so we did it and it totally saved our bacon, man. Yeah.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   Super easy. You have somebody who's mailing this stuff out or are you doing it? Yeah, no, not even
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.000]   Bonnie. That's all. No, that's, that's John Tilton, my, my director of digital as I call him now.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:04.720]   Good. He gets a title and a stamp scale. Sure. Stamps.com scales yours to keep.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:09.600]   Do try this $110 bonus offer though. Use the promo code TWIT. Yeah, makes sense. All of a
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.480]   sudden you got to mail out a bunch of stuff. Yeah. Well, and sooner or later, like anyone who has,
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.080]   if you ever find yourself, and there's a lot of people who at this moment are hearing this
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.760]   discussion are like, I don't need that, just file it away because that's what I did. And then
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:26.080]   all of a sudden overnight, I needed to send out 500 somethings and I didn't know what to do. And
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.080]   it was stamps.com made it easy. They got the discount. You can be saved as a ton of money.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:37.040]   Super great. Just a note, Petro Vlajos passed away this week. He invented the green screen.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:42.480]   He was 96 years old. He's founded a company with his son Paul. In 1976, you might have heard
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.680]   of called Ultimat. And without that, weathermen would not be, and women would not be able to predict
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:54.080]   the weather and point to the map. Dick Van Dyke would not have been able to dance with penguins
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:59.280]   and Mary Poppins. The blue skined Navi would not have been able to live on a floating mountain and
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:07.840]   avatar. The green screen inventor passed away, age of 96.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:17.600]   The creator of the Dalek costume. Ray Cusick, C-U-S-I-C. Is that his sole credit?
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.080]   I'm sure he did other brilliant things, but that's what I'll remember him for.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:30.240]   It's a pretty wild costume. Yeah. All right.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:38.880]   Moving along, let's talk about the PlayStation 4. Brian was here on Wednesday with me and Anthony
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:46.160]   Carboni from Revision 3 to talk. We talked over the PlayStation announcement, which was a lot of fun.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:53.840]   It was a bit of an MST3K moment. I think the gist of it came through with a little bit of
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.360]   extra color. People said nice things. Well, if you want to watch the announcement plane,
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.000]   Sony streamed it plane. But what we like to do, and this has become our trademark thing to do with
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.920]   keynotes and announcements, is we kind of gloss it. We annotate it irreverent annotation.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.000]   And I'll tell you, during the two hours, we peaked, I think it's something like 55,000
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.520]   simultaneous viewers. Wow. I am so glad you did not tell me that while it was happening.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.920]   It was good. It was, there was a lot of interest, and I'm not surprised.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:28.240]   First of all, why did Sony announce it in February? June is when E3 is. That's typically when you
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.880]   announce these kinds of things. They did say it'll be out at Christmas time, but isn't it a little
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.760]   early to talk about it now? Well, especially because they didn't show the actual unit. They
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:44.720]   didn't show the controller. Yeah. But from what I understand that they did the exact same thing
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.360]   with the PS3 and with the PS2. Now, this comes again, not from from me, but from my director of
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.960]   digital John Tilton, who is an obsessed Sony fanboy. So he said, this is exactly how they do it. And
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:59.520]   I guess I just missed it the previous go rounds. But they certainly did this. I mean, they, they set
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:06.000]   the stage. What normally is B level supplemental material on what are the specifics of you could
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.600]   do with particle physics? What titles, what, what creators are on board for all this stuff,
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.800]   the stuff that you care about less than the big info, they gave, they essentially gave us the
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.360]   director's commentary track first. And then we're going to get the feature at E3 and they certainly
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:27.040]   supercharged interest in it. So I assume that this is, if this is a method that they love to
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.440]   repeat year after or every time they release a new object, then I guess his business is usual.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:36.160]   And they certainly did a good job of stoking the fire. Well, and they also stoked Microsoft's
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:41.920]   competitive instincts because the rumor is now Microsoft will also do a pre-announce in April
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:49.120]   of its next Xbox. Yeah. So, so that was not public until after the PS4. Yeah, that's what we
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.040]   heard afterwards. Now, that's just a rumor. I don't know if that's confirmed, but Paul
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.640]   Therat indirectly of Windows Weekly fame indirectly confirmed it by saying, yes, no, no, don't,
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:04.720]   it's going to be something before June, which is E3. Will both of them come out at holiday
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:10.160]   buying season? I mean, again, it's it would be rampant speculation, but what else are we good
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.160]   at here at Twit? I'm going to say yes, both of them will definitely come out this year.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:20.080]   Pretty cool. That'll be a battle in the stores. Andy, are you a gamer, Andy? I don't, I think
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:26.560]   you are. Not really only because I don't want to, I make a living by doing this. And if I spent
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:29.840]   eight hours a day doing this, I would need a helper monkey to help me do this.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:36.400]   You know, I have an Xbox and I most use it for like home media and home entertainment,
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:42.240]   because it's become such a cool box for doing stuff like that. As a matter of fact, there was a,
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.360]   of course, Microsoft Xbox team was tweeting earlier today saying, oh, be sure to tune into the,
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.080]   to we got, we've got extra special pre pre pre pre pre red carpet live coverage from the
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:58.080]   rouse. Just two, three hours before you tune into the incredibly stupid half hour pre show on a
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:04.160]   ABC tune into our own stupid pre show. But, but, but, you know, if there, it's a great device for
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.600]   plugging into that kind of interest where they're not, you're not going to get the 14 million people
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:14.480]   who might be watching the actual, the actual telecast, but you're going to get the people who are,
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:18.720]   you're going to get maybe 100,000 200,000 people who are interested enough to really want to see
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:25.920]   the sort of nominees who work the boom, Mike on a best documentary short that are going to be
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.400]   showing up three hours before the actual show. Here's the, for those of you who didn't see the
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:37.280]   announcement, here is the video. Some videos. Some videos from my TV. What does it call?
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:46.080]   Ah, PlayStation. Video games for people who know and love video. I see.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:53.280]   The system consists of this PlayStation. So, if it's a, here's, here's exactly what the budget was.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.200]   They could afford Nemo. They couldn't afford Nemo's prize for shaving off the mustache.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:03.200]   At least he didn't have the point of years. I don't know what this is from. It's on IGN.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:09.760]   It's obviously the laser disc introduction with a PlayStation, PlayStation 4 theme.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:15.680]   Oh, that's amazing. PlayStation 4 has the appearance of a highly stylized record player.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.120]   [Laughter]
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:25.120]   This is on the IGN. He is for Hopkins. I'm pretty excited. What's interesting about what they're doing.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:34.720]   It is x86, 8 gigs of RAM. I just suggest everybody watch this video. You get pretty much all the
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.640]   info that you got from the real thing. Yeah, this is all you need to watch. They even had the games
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:44.800]   at the beginning and the play from the underside. Interesting. The encoded information on one thing
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:50.000]   that Sony did not announce that it's PS4 announcement is whether they would have a Blu-ray disc in there.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.160]   Although now, subsequently, Sony spokespeople have said, yes, we're going to still be using
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:00.160]   optical discs for game delivery. It did say, which I thought was odd, we'll pay attention to what
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.280]   games you like and download games ahead of time that you might be wanting to buy.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.560]   I think this is a great idea because keep in mind, it doesn't cost you anything. It's not space
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:14.720]   that is earmarked or prevents you from downloading other things. Basically, they know when they're
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:20.320]   there's a major release that they're going to purchase, that there is an opportunity to get it
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:26.080]   pre-downloaded on millions of systems. And then when somebody makes that snap decision,
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.200]   because how many times have you had that where there's a game you heard about, you're like,
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.720]   I don't know if that's for me. I don't know if this is that great or whatever. And then all of
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:37.280]   Twitter explodes with like OMG Rest Game ever. I think like, okay, I'm going to buy it. You go
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:42.400]   to buy it. And it's like tomorrow morning, you'll be able to play this game. This is just them
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:46.560]   making bets on this is the this is our bet on the kind of stuff we think you're going to like.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:50.960]   And it downloads it in advance so that when you make that snap decision,
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.440]   it's already pre-download it and you're able to jump in right away. I think there's nothing but
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:59.440]   win in this. Especially because presumably you could turn it off if you have bandwidth caps that
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:04.960]   would make this undesirable. Right. Well, and also keep in mind, Leo, how many people only have like
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:11.680]   1.5 megabits or even worse, you know, I've got a DSL with with a make a bit where it's like they
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:16.000]   would much rather have three it would take them three weeks of casual downloading before they
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.360]   would get this thing done. But also response to a notorious problem with the PlayStation 4,
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:23.360]   which is every time you put a game in, you might as well have a cup of coffee because it's going to
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:28.960]   update constantly. They also on the other side of that, they made it so that when you power it down,
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.440]   it doesn't fully power down. It goes into a sleep mode that sort of pauses it so that you're able
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:39.280]   to click it and go instantly on already ready to play the game. I think there's power. Power
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:45.600]   down. Power down. Why don't they call it that? That's a great idea. I also think that they did a
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:51.280]   smart thing with the most derided feature, I think, was the share button. But I also think it's the
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:56.400]   most savvy one because as Leo and I were talking about during the live event, the most surprising
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.200]   trend to me has been the discovery of how many people like to watch other people playing video
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:08.080]   games and to build it in at a base level of the console so that you can share your best kill or
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:14.320]   live stream, your play through or whatever. I think as silly as that sounds to a generation that
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.320]   doesn't play game or even the generation that does play games, there's an audience for whom
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.240]   this is going to be an extraordinarily valuable feature. The button is right on the controller.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.560]   You press the button as you're playing. In fact, they did it during one of the demos. They shared
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.040]   immediately to a Facebook page during the demo, which was very cool. That's share button.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.360]   I think what people want even more than that though, and I haven't heard anybody really announced
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:42.320]   this yet, is I think people want to see their friends' faces and watch TV socially, watch television
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:48.160]   movies, whatever socially. I don't know if you guys are fans of Japanese game shows, but Japanese
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.240]   game shows do this. When they show some crazy thing that guys being humiliated or whatever on
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:57.440]   screen, they show they have a panel of celebrities or whatever, and their faces are there, and the
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.920]   audience gets to watch the emotional reactions of these other people that they care about.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.000]   I can see that becoming a Twitter for television, whereas you watch a movie with
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.160]   somebody who's on the other side of the country. You can see each other, and so you can react,
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.760]   and you're in the same room enjoying this content. This is great. I'll go ahead.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.960]   No, no, I'd really like to see something like that. I'm almost certain that something like that
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:26.720]   they have to figure out how to make television not only asynchronous and separate from the whole
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.440]   live thing and the seasons and all that stuff, but also make it a form of social networking.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.800]   I was going to say that what I like about that observation is that it taps into a fundamental
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.440]   aspect of the way we perceive the world, which is the importance of social proof. We base our
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.840]   opinions on things, whether we like it or not, on what other people think of them, and that's the
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:51.520]   reason we have laugh tracks on Big Bang Theory is the reason that we value Yelp. It's the reason
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.400]   that we value Amazon reviews and to build that in fundamentally and the ability. And in fact,
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:02.080]   that's something that's underserved right now, because I think there exists a market for a class
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:08.400]   of media curators who decide to present content and give commentary on it while it happens. And the
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:14.960]   problem is with USTREAM and Justin.TV, we see that their software instantly shutting down
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.640]   whenever it's copyrighted content. But if we could have a structure where everybody's bought the
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:24.560]   movie and you're experiencing it as a group, it's yet another way we can virtualize the movie
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.880]   night experience that we've all enjoyed historically.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.280]   And it's why Twitter has a chat room.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:35.200]   Yes. Yeah. So it's been very interesting in this chat room because, of course, it's active
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:44.720]   during shows, but when discovery landed on Mars, I'm sorry, curiosity, curiosity landed on Mars,
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:50.000]   people were in the chat room participating during the other kind of geek events. The chat room is
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.200]   a community that exists beyond just having Twitch shows go on. And there's clearly this desire to
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:02.000]   kind of experience these things in a virtual space together. I think it's no doubt the Xbox
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.240]   was designed to get Microsoft into the living room. Sony, maybe missed a bet by not putting more
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.440]   social into the PlayStation 3. They're not going to miss it this time. They understand that they
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.720]   need to be a living room device. Although they said something interesting was really surprised me
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.320]   that the number one way people watch Netflix is in their PlayStation 3.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:25.520]   Yeah, this was, as I mentioned, this was something we talked about on frame rate. And this is at some
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:32.000]   point for all these devices that want to bring streaming to the living room. This is what's great
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.680]   about the positioning of both the PS3 and for the Xbox is that they're already there. And by virtue
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:45.600]   of being overpowered for a simple streaming, they are able to provide a super fast, super smooth
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.800]   experience. The number one way I watch content on Netflix is now my Xbox 360 in my living room.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.680]   And the only reason it's not a PS3 is because I didn't have a PS3 until like last month.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:02.240]   Yeah, I think this is great. And I think it shows that these consoles are becoming something more
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:07.760]   than a place to get headshots in the living room, which now that I said that sounds like something
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:14.960]   dirty. And I'm going to stop talking. It's very dirty. But I think that the bigger thing you're
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.240]   tapping into is this whole, it's not only just sort of, you know, these game consoles are going to
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.040]   become home servers. They're essentially servers for your home that will control not only your
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.320]   entertainment system, but also your lights and your home automation and sprinkler system and maybe
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.360]   even the security system and then I'll be tapped in on the internet with like Siri or Google now.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.560]   And you know, I think we're heading into a world where where the these living room systems are
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.200]   going to be super, super powerful. I'm really, really excited about the next Xbox though because
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.160]   of two technologies that seem to me to be really groundbreaking for gaming and probably some other
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:57.120]   things. One of them is, is a Luma Room, which is Microsoft's technology for projecting environment
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.120]   of the game on the walls and ceilings and floor of your living room as you're playing it.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:07.680]   This sounds like a really great idea to me. It's a really cool thing. The other one is that the
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:14.960]   next version of Connect is supposed to be so refined that it can read lips and doing all these other
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.800]   things. You know, you can see that you have a facial tick and like the side of your emotions
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.200]   and all this kind of stuff. So that could be really cool for a lot of things as well. So one of the
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.720]   things that's great about these consoles is they're really driving some pretty interesting technology.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.800]   The Luma Room, which is a Microsoft research project, they're doing some interesting things.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:38.720]   Some have rumored said that this will be part of the Xbox 720. That would be a killer feature.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:43.360]   The idea that they actually push a button on the Xbox and it takes over the whole room
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:51.280]   for the game. You're in call of duty and you're going through with a sniper rifle in the jungle
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:57.200]   and the whole living room is a jungle. That would be pretty awesome. Not even just that, but if all
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.880]   what we're doing, we're communicating with like Philip Smart Bulbs and simply be able to say,
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.600]   well, why don't we just we're in the jungle. Let's just make the room greener than bluer right now.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.920]   Right. And now we're in space. Let's put on some blue lighting effects there. But it really does
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:16.240]   underscore that if you're going to be rolling out an update to your game box, really what kind
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.480]   of games it plays and how it enhances the game experience that almost has to be like the third
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.400]   or the fourth thing you talk about after you talk about what a great living room computer this
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.880]   is going to be and how well it serves your media from other devices and how well it interacts with
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:37.600]   your real world stuff. So we'd like to be television set to replace phones so that
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:44.160]   somebody calls and it's a video call on your 41 inch screen TV and HD. That would be really
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.720]   that's not going to work because I think that I think that people really have defined the
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:54.720]   phone as the ultimate personal computer. It's not just a personal computer. It's a private computer.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.960]   It's I'm not taking this phone call on the same device that everybody in my family shares. This is
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:03.440]   my screen my device. I control the vertical the horizontally up down the end and the out.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:08.160]   So I'm not sure people are ready to do that quite yet apart from calling your grandparents.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.680]   But there are two kinds of communication. One of them is that kind of communication where
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:16.320]   and that kind of computing where it's highly personal, highly individualized and all that sort
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:22.960]   of thing. The other thing is like I spent a lot of time on Google plus and the hang out phenomenon
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:28.080]   is amazing. And one of the coolest types of hangouts is something called an ambient hangout where you
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.480]   just keep the thing running. So I can see people who are very close to each other. You don't do this
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.720]   for everybody but just certain people that are you're very close with and you just keep this thing
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.680]   on all the time and it creates the psychological illusion that you're in the same room even if you
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.880]   maybe in even different countries or something like that. So like.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:54.480]   Running and. When you put it that way I definitely can see that sort of thing.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:00.400]   But that still requires a little bit of a shift. I mean I love the fact that throughout most of
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:05.920]   the show we're talking about really really great ideas that are technologically feasible. We have
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.320]   the hardware tech capability. We have the software and the networking capability. What we really need
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:14.720]   is for people's perceptions and their relationships to their technology and communications.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:20.480]   Just shift just enough to allow them to the to. I think about what if I just had a camera that was
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:26.080]   open all the time on my on my living room. So as I'm taking care of the kids as I'm feeding the dog
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.560]   as I'm playing a game people that I select that I would like to share this part of my life with
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.760]   be able to see it. Well isn't that your vision for Google Glass to right. Well that's that's
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.560]   it's more of a discreet on off sort of thing. There there are a lot of times when I would love to
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.160]   simply there there are times when you take you take a snapshot of something and you want to send
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.120]   to some and send it to somebody because someone is getting into roller derby and they might want
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.280]   to know that there is a venue opening up in about two months because you just pass by a construction
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.320]   site that's going to have that as one of their opening night things and the ability to simply
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:05.760]   not have to stop and explicitly take a thick picture but simply say oh okay okay glass take a picture
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.880]   now send it to Mara and and you're done and you're continuing to walk or sharing an event where you
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:17.200]   are you're in the third row at your daughter's recital and your your partner is someplace 300
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.800]   miles away they can't be there but they can actually see it via hangout the grandparents the
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:25.360]   friends can see it via hangout that's a that's a total that's a different thing I mean but this
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.760]   this idea of my room is next to your room you can see what's going on in my room you can hear
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.880]   what's going on in my room there's there's a there's a time when when the webcams not that not the naughty
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.720]   kinds of webcams but the you know that that's just the plain jane once where someone wanted to see
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.400]   hey isn't it cool i've got enough bandwidth and i can actually keep a webcam going you know because
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.720]   i i there was a time when i would bookmark a couple of those things because it was kind of interesting
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:52.240]   being a freelancer and and having an office of one person where i have this window open where i'm
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.280]   just seeing another person's random activity day after day after day it was it was a lot like it
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.760]   gave me sort of the experience of working in a cubicle farm where i don't know necessarily the
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.400]   life of this other person but i look up say oh i see that might cut a haircut wow i'm not sure if i
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.000]   i kind of like when he had his hair longer okay well what am i working on right now so that's
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.560]   we know what all this is is we talked about uh and and somebody in the chat room will give me the
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.760]   the scientific name for the number but that number that that is the upper limit of of how many people
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.480]   you could perceive in your tribe it's a hundred and fifty people like you can think of people who
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.040]   are real people to you but after that hundred and fifty it gets a little mushy and yeah they're
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.280]   people but you don't really think of them as as people um the Dunbar number there you go thank you
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.160]   very much chat room my spare brain uh helping me out there uh and so if it google glass you wouldn't
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:43.600]   have to look at that screen well exactly you remember that here's the thing is we we are built
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.520]   with wetware that has an upper limit of a hundred and fifty people in a tribe of 150 i know where to go
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:55.360]   to get a good place to eat you know uh beyond that it's when you live in a city of six million people
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:01.840]   you need enhancement you need uh a cybernetic assistant you need to become more than than human
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:08.080]   in order to properly process this and get ironically a more human experience and likewise uh you know
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.640]   if you're disconnected by physical space doing like your idea andy of having a virtual room right
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:18.000]   next door that you could peek in on unloved ones and people that you want you know what if you entered
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.320]   an age where you had virtual roommates where it was kind of a big deal where it's like hey man i don't
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:28.000]   want virtual roommates i mean i mean you i'm a grown up i don't want roommates at all
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.120]   i i don't i'm virtually you're rid of my real roommate yeah
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.240]   i mean i guarantee you there are thousands of people who who that would be an exciting thing
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.760]   it's like hey man we really like each other we play this game together we connect we should be
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.440]   virtual roommates and have an always-armed connection again it's like a larger point
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:49.200]   yeah but the larger point you're making brian and the the larger point that that that andy is
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.080]   made as well is that silicon valley really the biggest challenges you have to build a better user
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:59.680]   because people are slow to embrace this thing there's so many possibilities but people just are
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:07.120]   it's really hard you're so slow yes adopt adopt adopt there's a there's a phrase i use a lot which
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.680]   is after someone pitches me an idea or some really big concept like that and i say that's a great idea
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.520]   but a lot of people are going to have to die first uh which is not me that there's going to have to
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.120]   be a machine or anything like that but it's a lot of people are going to have to age out of the
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.040]   system and a whole generation is going to have to age in it's one of the reasons why i think that
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.720]   like like like like touch string computers are going to become much bigger thing uh once we
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.760]   have a whole generation of kids who are growing up where their very first contact with a computer
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:38.960]   is is not a mouse not a keyboard but a touchscreen device a phone or something like that and those
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:43.520]   are the people when they become 10 11 12 13 and they become people that you're going to have to
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:48.560]   market a computer to they're going to say keyboard what's that you know what what it's a nice accessory
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.040]   i might buy one of those if i if i want one later on but i'm going to need a touchscreen so yep
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.560]   exactly right we're gonna take our mind uh it's so it's so easy for us to look at these things and
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.080]   first of all let me just say that this is my favorite tweet that we've ever done because how long has
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.480]   it been since we've had a whole bunch of stories that were all about big ideas that we didn't know
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.680]   i love that stuff yeah society or not this is a great time yeah but uh and by the way our job in
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.400]   a way is to and if i were silicon valley i'd really promote shows like ours because really what we're
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.920]   about is kind of saying come on people this is interesting stuff you might want to try this
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:26.080]   we are here to push this envelope forward i think and the weird part is is we're gonna put these
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.760]   ideas out there and we can all speculate on where it's going to go and what the future is going to
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:34.480]   hold for us but it's really not even up to us it's like all of us are too old to matter it's going
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.080]   to be my eight-year-old daughter at her perception of the google glass is she going to be more overwhelmed
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.920]   with how cool it is to have an always on connection or is she going to be more grossed out by having
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.880]   this you know bored like thing on your face and it's them who are going to decide what what the
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.280]   future holds so it's like there's some part of me that's like i mean it's like i dig it but you know
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.960]   let's just sit back and see what the world says i'm on i'm on scary scary aspects to all this
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.240]   uh and probably the scariest of which is that you if everybody has google glass or an i watch or
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.200]   something like that in a constant stream of instant information that's pro preemptive and comes at
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.640]   you all the time and it's always contextual and any question can be answered what's the value of
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:22.000]   knowledge knowledge has no value if you use if your brain is no knowledge has value facts have no
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.680]   value facts have become a commodity but understanding in in the knowledge have become much more valued
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:32.560]   because of that no no no the knowledge is that okay you're confusing knowledge is the data that's
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.040]   the thing uh would you rather have random access where you can instantly grab it in your brain or
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:41.680]   would you rather have uh you know magnetic storage on the internet where you have a three second lag
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:47.760]   between were you wanting to access it and being i was i was uh i set my father-in-law up with a
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:53.920]   an ipad many moons not many moons a year or two ago and he was just blown away and he was playing
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:59.760]   with uh one of the planet's apps and he said you know if kapurnicus had had this he wouldn't have
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:03.760]   had to do all those observations he could have just played with it and said you know i think we
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.880]   revolve around the sun that the facts weren't what was important about what kapurnicus did but he had
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:14.640]   to spend 90 percent of his energies gathering the information so that he could oh we just lost mike
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   we'll get him back so that he could make the uh the analysis that really changed the world and so
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.760]   i think that's what's so exciting about this the facts have become you know common i mean i spent
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:31.760]   i spent i spent so much of my math education as a kid learning how to do uh do square roots manually
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:37.280]   whereas kids right being taught right now they don't they know that well if i don't want you to
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.320]   know if the square root is i will tap some things into a thing that costs about three dollars at any
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   at any drugstore but the great thing about the soft and the technology is that you can now teach
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:51.440]   these kids here is what a cosign function wants i want you to understand the function of an
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.240]   integral not just know how to do it i want you to understand that when you see a collection of data
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.320]   this is when you see a function here is what an integral will let you do to it and we'll let you
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:05.360]   understand the curve the best example of this have you guys seen this dragon box app on the on the
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.080]   ipad where it secretly teaches algebra to eight-year-olds have you seen this no but i gotta get it because
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.360]   i've got an eight-year-old no i don't this is this is but i never did learn algebra so so so the way the
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:20.800]   dragon box app starts off is that it's a game where you have cards and you have two boxes and they're
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:26.000]   and it deals out a bunch of cards and your object is to get rid of all the cards on one box except
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.680]   for the dragon box and uh there's rules for example each card has a light side and a night side and
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:37.120]   when you put a night side card on top of a face-up one it vanishes or becomes a vortex that you get
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.760]   rid of but whatever you do on one side you have to do on the other side and then and so you master
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.000]   that and then it starts adding the idea like well some of these are stuck together and to get rid
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   of those two you have to draw a line and and put it underneath one and again whatever you do on the
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.160]   left side you have to do the right side and then at some point after you're playing this game
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.600]   it uh it starts replacing the cards instead of being pictures of dragons and and you know and
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:05.520]   teddy bears or whatever they start throwing like fives and fors and then negative c's and then at
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.720]   some point they replace the dragon box with the letter x and all of a sudden you realize that
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.720]   you're solving for x and then finally it drops the two the two sides and instead starts expressing
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:21.040]   everything algebraically using the proper form my eight-year-old daughter just finished the entire
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:25.680]   thing I promised her if she could finish all hundred exercises and get three stars on each I would
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:30.080]   make her a plaque to put on the wall saying that she learned algebras at eight years old.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:36.480]   You are sneaky! She already got it man it's amazing I can't even put into words how much fun I went
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.360]   back and did it because I just wanted to remember how this stuff is and the gamification of learning
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.480]   so this is one of the most advances the biggest advances in my lifetime so this is kind of like
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:52.560]   a cut the rope or angry birdger you're playing a game that seems like you're solving problems
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:58.560]   physics problem that kind of thing but inspect your learning math. Yeah in fact here I'll go I
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.720]   actually have here here we go so this is this is one of the later levels here I don't know if
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.800]   you can actually see it on here yeah we can see it uh there we go says I just mastered the basics
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:13.040]   of algebra so let me go so they admit it they admit it yes finally so if I play I'm going to jump
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.640]   forward to one of the early ones here and I guess I'll go back near the beginning when you go back
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.880]   near the beginning the initial things are here I'll just pick one of these at random so in this
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.960]   case you got a bunch of different cards some of them are on top of each other and so you got to
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:33.120]   figure out how to oh I get it you get in the box on one side yeah correct and then in fact and
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.600]   then later on let me see if I can actually go out to one of the later ones where once you're actually
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:42.960]   solving for x in a real algebra setup here we'll do this I'll do one of these last ones here
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:50.400]   do you see by the end now all of a sudden it's uh a over a over 5 plus x equals negative c and so
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.480]   you you know again you start figuring out what you need to do so here we're going to get rid of the
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.520]   five on this we'll do this there we'll pop this over here and this is stuff my eight-year-old did
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.960]   on the live stream there we go and we'll do negative you did you did a live stream yeah we did it we
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:09.920]   did it just the other day it was fantastic I'm telling you these guys are are shaping the future
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:16.400]   education because by gamifying it uh like she got it instantly there we go and I solve for x and
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:22.080]   then I'm done it's it's amazing by 12 more denominators for only one dollar nine percent in
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:27.040]   that purchase it's a five dollar game you pay you take all my money if that's what it takes to get
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:31.200]   a kid to an else run the question the question the question is and this is this is just like one
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:36.560]   of those beard stroking questions where where I hope that it I hope that the kids can take away
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.960]   everything they need to know about that subject and they don't wind up like three or four or five
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:47.360]   years later when they expect all math and all engineering and all physics to be fun that no but
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.760]   this is not like a game it isn't like a game you're fit you're you are trying you're actually placing
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:56.560]   an order for cubic yards of cement to fit to finish this patio that you're open to design
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:00.720]   it's there there is not little there is not a little dancing orange that comes by to help you you
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:05.280]   have to sit down it doesn't matter by that point you've already crafted the neural pathways and now
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:10.320]   that's what I think yeah now you're trying to earn money and and the fact that you've already had
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:15.200]   experience with this starting you know a decade earlier makes a big difference I think this I think
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:19.280]   this is a very subtle but it what it's really teaching you is the understanding of cancellation
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:24.080]   and and all of that and you learn it it doesn't matter that it's not numbers initially in it
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:28.720]   than it is numbers it's in your head exactly you've got the neural path words and and by the way
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:35.920]   I'm playing it right now so it's a different you know mine I'm just gonna hear it it's easy at first
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:41.440]   it really is and what's funny is is they do as you expect with games what one of the beauties of
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:47.520]   video games is that it's one of the few institutions where you where your reward for doing better is
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:53.920]   for problems to get harder and so by gamifying it they've essentially created a by taking advantage
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:58.480]   what games have done for 20 30 years they essentially make it to where you keep learning more more
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:06.320]   complicated algebra problems and it's fantastic man yeah well there's also there's also the way that
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:11.360]   the slot machines sort of train the brain into a certain behavior that's productive for the casino
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.480]   by regulating the release of certain chemicals inside your brain so you're not necessarily
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.320]   solved you're not necessarily solving the statistical problem of blackjack you're not necessarily
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:25.680]   solving a certain matching and padding problem pattern problem of a video slot machine you're
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:32.720]   simply doing what you need to do to get that next shot of happy juice into your brain so I think
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.240]   I'm not disagreeing with you on anything that you're saying I think this is I think this is a great
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.960]   game I just again this this is why this is why I bracket this with the HTML tag beard stroking
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.680]   because there's there's there's there's nothing that can ruin anything more than say yeah but what
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:52.320]   if what if you're instead of instead of giving people giving the kids the happy the happy response
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.320]   of I have learned something new I understand something I didn't understand before I've solved
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.880]   this problem that would would have baffled me just a week ago and you're saying but wait a
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:05.360]   minute I'm supposed to feel very very happy right now because they're supposed to be more points involved
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:10.160]   I'm feeling very happy just like getting three stars all I've done is figure out how they
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:14.880]   lost Leo maple and he's gonna be learning algebra exactly he's just gonna be pulling that slot
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.280]   machine he's got like two cigarettes going four slots machines going they're gonna have to drag
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:24.000]   him out of the casino after the after he's after he's sold his Ford sink for another round of a
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.200]   roulette I'm stuck Brian how do I solve this one cancel out those sixes you got sixes on the right
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:34.320]   hands yeah they cancel out huh how do I do that oh I'm right with this with this yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:42.720]   now they cancel now they cancel oh wrong cards you got to never learn math that's hard
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.840]   just like that episode of the next generation you played that clip from where even even Dr. Crusher
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:55.840]   was like all you have to do is let the machine go on its own machine all right we're gonna take
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.880]   a break we are in Barcelona thanks to uh mr. Mike yelgin we got him back and we're gonna find out
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.600]   what's coming up mobile world congress already Samsung with a few announcements and I think so
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.080]   far HTC might have the best Android phone out there they announced the HTC one this week not
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:14.880]   in Barcelona and it looks really sweet but we'll talk about that in just a bit right now I want to
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:21.120]   tell you about Gazelle I'll tell you the math on this one's pretty straightforward your gadget
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:27.440]   your doo-dah your thingamajig is not getting more valuable it's getting less valuable every day
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:32.400]   if you think a new hot phone is coming here's what you do go to Gazelle.com and get a quote for
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.760]   your old phone right now so that you at least have the quote what they will lock these quotes in
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:45.760]   let's say okay you got the the HTC 8x and you're thinking I want the new HTC one how much can I
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.800]   get for my 8x you just go in here you're gonna calculate the quote all right 171 bucks now
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.040]   here's a beauty part that's good for 30 days you don't have to cash that in yet in fact you
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:00.400]   might want to go back and say you know I got an old iPad certainly a second generation iPad
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:05.120]   isn't worth very much let's just check out check it out and see what that's worth
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:11.760]   240 bucks this is better than gambling so what we're gonna do is we're gonna add all these to a box
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:17.120]   once you've got everything in your closet everything in your drawers and you piled it all up Gazelle
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:22.320]   will send you the box postage paid on anything worth more than a buck you sent it in their data
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.240]   experts will wipe the data you have to worry about even thinking about that and then they'll send
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:32.320]   you a check PayPal credit or an Amazon gift card in fact the pro tip on this is get that Amazon
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:39.040]   gift card because if you shop a lot of Amazon it's well worth it they bump the price 5% so this is
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:44.640]   just fantastic now go to Gazelle.com take a look at what they'll buy iPhones a variety of cell
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:52.720]   phones including blackberries a lot of Samsung Nokia phones you got an old AT&T Nokia Lumia
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:58.400]   920 you're ready to get that Windows 8 phone let's say it's only in good condition because you
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:03.040]   but it is free of water damage let's calculate how much that's worth it's kind of fun this like
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:06.720]   this is that gambling thing they should have a little thing those ding ding ding ding hundred
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:09.440]   eighty nine bucks plume Gazelle.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.040]   I just think they should add a randomizer so it's like you never know what you're gonna get and then
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:19.200]   you just you got that instinct you're like let me do it again some wise stuff Gazelle has over
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:24.960]   the last couple of years paid 50 million dollars half a million customers worse one of them and
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:30.240]   we sell our stuff all the time on Gazelle and I invite you to do the same Gaz E L L E really what
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.640]   you're doing is recycling making sure somebody who wants that device gets it while you get the
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:40.640]   latest and greatest that's why they came to the Twitter audience they know they know you you guys
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:48.240]   don't sit on phones for five years G A Z E L L E .com why use a third generation iPad when you can
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:55.440]   have a fourth generation iPad let's just see what that I really should get rid of this 290 bucks
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:04.400]   let's get it G A Z E L L E .com sell that old stuff and buy the new stuff we lost Mike again huh
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:10.000]   we're gonna get him back Barcelona this has got to be the trade show everybody in the tech
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.880]   press wants to go to because it's in Barcelona but also Mobile World Congress has become one of the
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:20.240]   most interesting shows as more last year Nokia Microsoft announced Surface there
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:29.200]   already we've seen two eight inch Android tablets the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 announced today I think
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:34.960]   in advance of Mobile World Congress HP said we're gonna make an eight inch as well
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:40.640]   the Galaxy Note 8 is kind of interesting in Europe it will have a phone on it so this is what I've
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.760]   been saying we should make an apple should make a Mac mini with phone Samsung's doing it it's got the
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:54.000]   S Pen and the pen the pen is gonna be a really interesting differentiator I mean Android tablets
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   have been kind of useless because they haven't been a lot of a lot of pieces of software that
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.840]   really take advantage of of the larger form factor right but a device a Samsung device with an S Pen
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:10.400]   this really cool responsive sensitive free precise point of ice it's the reason why I really like
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.880]   the the note too and why I find myself using it a lot more than I would like to admit to
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:23.040]   as the host of Mac pre-weekly you better not best not say anything I prefer to call it a proof
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:29.040]   of concept for how wonderful and I pad with the stylist would be I want this to be a phone but
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:35.200]   not in the US I guess the carriers still are pretty powerful in the US so Mike you're in Barcelona
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.560]   because you just want to be in Barcelona who wouldn't yes yes one of the one of the cities in the world
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:46.720]   yeah and and are radically underappreciated city I think this is genuinely one of the great
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.520]   cities of the world yeah well all the Goutie stuff and the beautiful buildings the people
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:57.920]   the fact that you don't have to attend a clock at night and it's got paella that's right so
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:02.640]   but you're gonna go to the mobile world congress oh yeah absolutely I already went to the I was
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:10.000]   very disappointed to go to the the media reception tonight yeah it's tonight here and
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.080]   it was the main sponsor was HTC and I was hoping to see an HTC one and they didn't even have a
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:23.200]   table I mean they weren't even presents yeah I was really disappointing but I think I think that
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:30.080]   I expect that this show will be similar in some respects to CES in that there's going to be a
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:35.600]   big showing by the alternative operating systems for mobile and also the alternative hardware
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:44.000]   vendors so for example there are some Chinese handset vendors that are ascendant as we speak
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.880]   Huawei Huawei
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:56.160]   and and also Xtia cool pad actually most people don't realize that cool pad is actually a larger
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:03.360]   handset maker in China than Apple Apple is actually number six now in terms of overall
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:09.840]   handsets and these Chinese companies are taking over fast in in Africa in Kenya for example
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:18.880]   probably 60% of the smartphones and smartphones were growing like crazy they're taking over from
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.920]   feature phones were hoey phones and you see you see billboards everywhere they're going after the
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:29.280]   their strategy in China and then their strategy in Asia and now their strategy in the whole world
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:34.720]   and next their strategy in the United States is always to go after the very very low end and
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:41.040]   then grow it up until they're dominant isn't that what Korea did a few years ago with LG and Samsung
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:47.760]   and now look who's number one that's exactly right and now they have the manufacturing power
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:52.480]   of being a Chinese company hey they make everything anyway why don't they just sell it themselves
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:58.560]   that's right you can you can hire a designer you can you can do all that stuff in i i i i fear that
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:04.160]   that we're facing a future where smartphones will become less interesting because to a very large
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:08.560]   extent they'll be commoditized they'll have the same features and everybody will buy on price
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:14.480]   and so companies in a world like that companies like Wayan T and ZTE are really going to do well
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:20.880]   there's also these alternative operating systems left isum if i'm saying that right yeah is a
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:26.880]   sam sam song owns that right sam song sam song and intel are working on it as a sort of an open
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:31.920]   platform but it's really a sam song driven it's linnick's thing which is kind it's linnick's base
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:36.080]   but it's kind of scary that it's a sam song thing because of course sam song is probably the
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:41.280]   poster child for innovation in the android space right so it's it's kind of kind of
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.680]   be interesting so i expect to see a lot of tyson activity going on that there should be
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:51.040]   handsets running that operating system later in the year i think this is sam son's way of saying
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:57.520]   apple uh i'm rather and google you don't own us uh we could always start making tyson phones
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:04.000]   well they they really want to be more like apple and have not their own hardware vendor because
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.960]   you know i think they see the writing on the wall they're we're going toward this commoditized low
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:15.200]   cost hardware uh uh world where phones are very cheap the hardware is very inexpensive
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.600]   and they don't want to be see their margin shrink to nothing as a hardware vendor so they want the
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:24.800]   software services they want to have downloadable content they want to be like apple and who wouldn't
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.840]   well i that's what i think the HTC is doing with the one this is clearly HTC saying
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.160]   we're going to make a premium phone that's made that i mean this it looks like an iphone five
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:44.000]   it's made of metal not plastic they are doing their own very almost metro like ui htc sense five is
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:52.000]   has no drop shadows no gradients it's square it's clean it's a very high res 1080p 4.7 inch
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:59.680]   screen in a machine aluminum unibody this is clearly a high end phone aimed at that non-com
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:04.560]   monetized market that apple has been so good exactly and i think that people miss the thing
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:10.400]   about this phone that is the most apple-esque uh quality which is that it's one phone
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:20.080]   HTC is actually one of the first Asian companies to move from a world in which oh we have 50 phones
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:27.360]   one for every imaginable uh demographic to the apple model of like here is the phone yeah this
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:33.680]   is the one phone and and that i think is is a powerful change and it's something that i'd like
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:37.920]   see other companies embrace this is the best phone we could possibly make and it's for everybody
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:44.000]   that's how apple does it and it really works yeah yeah i mean it's it's it's good to see it's a
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.240]   offers a certain amount of clarity for consumers because a company has to say we're not going to
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.560]   simply make every phone imaginable we're telling you this is the best phone you can have right now
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:57.200]   we believe it so much that we're actually putting all of our resources behind this one device on the
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:05.040]   other hand you it also means that when will one phone really make so many people that happy i think
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:10.240]   that Samsung takes this to a ridiculous degree because now they have is it now five different phone
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:15.280]   sides everything from four inches to uh twelve inches or something but they certainly benefited
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:21.520]   from the fact that they had a rational size and iPhone like phone a 4.8 inch phone and then they
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.600]   were able to take a risk on something the size of the note to and then when everyone said wow we
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:30.320]   really love this note to they can say oh what about these other phones we didn't actually build those
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:35.440]   see because we had this right all along it's it's it is a gamble but if they guess right then this
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:40.480]   gonna pay off really big for them one one thing it's interesting go ahead i'm sorry go ahead Leo
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:45.920]   okay it's less of a gamble because because there are so many companies doing the Samsung model
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:51.360]   and so few companies doing the Apple model that it actually makes sense for some second company to
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.760]   try the Apple model in a world where everybody's doing the Apple model it would be a terrible
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:02.480]   idea but in fact it's very very difficult to be an android handset maker and differentiate and
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:07.360]   yes this is well here's another very interesting differentiation HTC is going to have a four
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:15.200]   megapixel camera smart smart i think this is really smart because what they said is remember
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.160]   apple used to say this the megahertz myth now Samsung saying it's the or HTC saying it's the
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:26.720]   megapixel myth well especially because all you guarantee yourself is that your file size is your
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:34.240]   file size your file sizes will be in size of a nozzle yes yeah sisal menisles yeah well what they're
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.560]   saying is you know they're not making bigger sensors when they're adding megapixels they're
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:44.960]   just making smaller and smaller pixels and that just means lower and lower quality this is going
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:52.160]   to be much better low light performance it's an f 2.0 lens and the pixel size it four megapixels is
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:58.160]   higher i think what they're saying which i think is really smart is it's the computation power not
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.560]   the number of pixels that are going to make the difference in a camera this could be the best camera
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:07.920]   out there at four megapixels it remains to be seen it's going to deliver the sort of results
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.680]   that people can really absolutely see they're not necessarily going to be able to
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:15.760]   when they look at a picture from a camera then a camera phone they're not necessarily going to
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.320]   be able to see that oh well i can actually sense that the woman crossing in the background of the
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:24.640]   street scene is wearing a check pattern code instead of a solid pattern code they're definitely going
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.680]   to notice that in a room with not great lighting you could there's actually texture on the wall
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:35.440]   behind the people who are standing there and all these manufacturers apple no less than any other
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:40.720]   is figuring out that they're bumping their heads against the limitations of how good an image you
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:46.000]   can pull out of a camera that's only this thick one of the best and probably worst surprises of the
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.080]   iPhone 5 was that a camera that is a phone that's noted for having the best picture-taking ability of
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:57.920]   any phone out there made only a marginal improvement over when i went out before in a field in which
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:04.240]   they got spanked in low light performance by the luvia 920 and their closest competitors are doing
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:08.080]   pictures that are very nearly as good it's hard to produce a situation in which
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:14.720]   in which the iPhone 5 is going to produce a notably better image than than a lot of the
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.560]   competition up there so they're going to have to go they're going to dig deeper into bags of tricks
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:23.360]   right now such as we're going to compromise on the megapixel count for better quality image
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.840]   you might even see apple decide that well you know what what if we were to oh my god forgive us
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.320]   lord for speaking this name in vain but make a phone that's maybe three millimeters thicker than
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.720]   the last year's model because we're going to need to do something to create better image performance
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:42.720]   what we have right now mike what are you looking forward to at mwc tell us i presume the samsung s4
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:48.880]   and there's going to be firefox os phones with one two os will probably have a presence there tell
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.000]   us a little bit about what you're looking forward to well i don't think i don't think actually
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.120]   don't think samsung is going to have um gonna be announcing a whole lot of new stuff i mean maybe
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.880]   i could be completely wrong about that but i think they're gonna try you know they're the kind of
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:06.960]   company that's going to want to um to uh sort of set their own agenda and get get away from the noise
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.360]   and make their own announcement settle later date but i i'm really looking forward to these alternative
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:18.320]   um uh platforms it's really uh it's really a new world because we we currently live in an
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:25.280]   ios and android world clearly and that's where all the uh action is and now we have all these players
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:30.800]   five new platforms that are going to be vying for attention and i think that they're the kind
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.000]   of platforms they're going to want to have a good foothold in europe and they're going to be
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.920]   here in a big way they're all in a space but the firefox os i think is going to be a big thing
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:46.800]   and i just think there's going to be a lot of um a lot of these a lot of the theme of this show i
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:53.680]   have the feeling is going to be here is all the ways that we can bring down the ios and the android
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:59.760]   empires with alternatives that could be really huge in future and everybody's gonna be trying
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:06.000]   some more dramatic things so i'm in general that's what i suspect is going to happen at this at
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:13.200]   this show because that's what's happening this year all right we're gonna take a break i thought
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.800]   there'd be more but i'm back
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.120]   we're gonna take a break we'll come back there's some interesting things going on in piracy
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:27.760]   the six strikes law goes into effect tomorrow we'll tell you what you can expect if you continue
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:35.920]   pirating with your isp and um it was one other story i thought we should uh oh the uh the nascar
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:41.760]   youtube video kerfuffle coming up in just a bit before we do that though let's take a look at what's
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:46.960]   coming up in the week ahead maybe tom marrot has something exciting to see hey thanks leo here's
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:51.280]   look at what's coming up in the week ahead on tech news today these are the stories will be
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:57.360]   following anyway the sentencing of andrew r and hymer aka weave is expected to take place monday
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.600]   february 25th that's in the ipad email intrusion case also on monday the mobile world congress

[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.800]   make sure you watch tech news today for your daily dose of tech news monday through friday
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:48.640]   with tom marrot sary lane i as actar 10 a.m pacific uh that's one p.m eastern time 1800 utc
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:54.000]   live on twitt dot tv and of course you can download it for your commute home we usually get it out
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.160]   before the end of the end of the business day on uh the week before noon we try before noon our time
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:06.080]   our time before three east coast time before eight in the evening if you're living in great
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:12.320]   britain right you can do the math for the rest of the countries i don't know what it is what time is
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:19.440]   it in barsalona right now it's late it's uh why it's ten minutes before two a.m i really am grateful
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:24.320]   mike you join us you know in the middle of the night whenever you join us now but uh i'm really
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:31.280]   you know it somebody's got to live in barsalona and i think i agree and thank you i've only
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:36.000]   been on that one mike this is really kind of you thank you i do what i can i do what i will
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:45.120]   receive the order of leon for this comrade um six strikes yeah let's i'm gonna take a break
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.920]   wait let's talk about six strikes because i think everybody should be aware of this
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:54.480]   you may be you may be getting re-educated later this month but first of words from citrix our
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:59.360]   friends at citrix have yet another great pro i think coming up with great stuff this one is called
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:05.040]   go to assist if you're in it you ought to know about this sometimes the it tools you use to solve
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:09.280]   problems are more complicated than the problem you're solving that's not what you need you need
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:14.080]   something that helps you get the job done without getting in your way and this is a complete now
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:19.040]   complete toolset go to assist started with the best remote access still used by more people than
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:24.800]   any other remote access solution but of late they've added new modules to make it even more useful
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:33.520]   all in the cloud an entire cloud base toolset to make you an it hero so you got the remote support
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:39.600]   mac p c mobile devices you can you know fix anything anywhere unattended support as well as
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:46.160]   attended support you can also uh do an assay of the hardware and software you can find out what's
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:50.800]   going on now that's just the beginning they've got now a new module called monitoring that lets
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:58.480]   you monitor all of the things on your client's network you run the uh the uh go to assist crawler
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:04.080]   you'll detect all the hardware and software on the network and then you can set up a dashboard
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:09.920]   that will let you know what's going on so they've got some preset uh dashboard modules but you
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:15.120]   can customize your own everything from you know network performance loading on the server to
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.800]   a toner cartridge and how full it is how much hard drive space is left and then you get alerts
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:28.560]   via text or email um instant messenger on and so you're always aware of what's going on and you
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.280]   get in there and get that remote support done fix the problem before it becomes a big headache
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:38.320]   that's the monitoring and then now also they have a complete service desk solution that lets you
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:45.360]   track and resolve issues uh it also lets you do things like um track infrastructure changes
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:53.600]   track releases really cool i have to say that this has now become a very sweet tool set if you're in

[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:23.040]   use the offer code twitch so it's called CAS CAS and it is a system that virtually all the
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:31.120]   ISPs in the US have agreed it's a US version of the three strikes law that uh hadoop that they use
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:36.480]   in uh france that was proposed in england are you excited getting ready brian
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:44.560]   what is this uh loaded question you're ready for the copyright the copyright alert system
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:50.720]   uh look it's okay so as i understand and i'm remember i'm an ad who eats fire for a living but
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:56.800]   but walk me through this yeah but you know algebra and i have to respect that basically uh once you
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.360]   get six strikes and then what you get you get your ISP card yank they won't know you know that and
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:10.240]   this is what's unclear so um time Warner AT&T cable vision Comcast Verizon all have agreed to
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:16.240]   implement this they'll all do it a little bit differently starts tomorrow uh the problem with
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:22.080]   the dupe in the france was you accused if you're accused of a copyright crime um you're guilty
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:27.440]   you're guilty and you get three strikes and then in france anyway you're banned from the internet
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:33.440]   um this is a little bit different uh first of all it doesn't look like banning you just have to get
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:40.640]   re-educated they will throttle speeds your data speed they can if you're so what they'll do is
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:46.240]   you send you a notice they'll say we're gonna slow you they you get six strikes but after strike
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:51.200]   i don't know what two or three they start throttling your speed they slow you down after five or six
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:55.200]   strikes they're gonna put up a landing page every time and try to use the internet says you you may
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:02.320]   not use the internet unless you get re-educated and you'll have to go to camp yeah you have to go
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:07.360]   to camp no they have a it's an online uh copyright education plan they don't say
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:13.280]   clockwork orange a lot of that only the FBI copyright one i guess right as an all right
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:17.280]   a person just keeps putting eyedrops in your eyes i just hope they have eyedrops that's all i can say
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.200]   yeah is this a legal thing or is this a consortium where they have decided that they're all going
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:27.920]   to sign on for this behavior consortium uh yeah oh obama the white house statement was that we
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.760]   think this is exactly the way to solve this problem we don't want to legislate this we want
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:35.440]   people to figure out how to do this without bringing uh bringing the government into into
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.000]   the good news is they are correct about that however unfortunately it's just gonna feel just
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.880]   as draconi whenever you have a law that does something that pro him is something that everybody
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:50.480]   wants to do looking at you drug war uh you all you get so you just want to sit there get high and
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.280]   download bit torrents is that what you do okay hold on who's jesus you're putting words of my
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:01.520]   mouth sir uh what all you get is weasily activity to dodge the law all you want to get out of this
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:07.440]   is savvy people buying uh vpn services where they they have encrypted traffic and then they'll
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:13.440]   double down and now what was a previously relatively transparent bit torrent uh marketplace will
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:19.120]   suddenly go underground and as you guys know i'm i'm a report reformed bad guy i used to
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:24.320]   i used to download all kinds of pirated stuff off of uh originally bbs's where you had to build
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.240]   up a relationship and then you got in and it was all you could eat buffet of other people's software
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:33.280]   then uh then the internet made it possible to get credits eventually you could get a leech
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:37.280]   account on somebody's ftp whereas all you could eat software or whatever but those were very
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:43.760]   difficult to track down bit torrent is is monitorable and it's relatively transparent and again there
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:50.000]   are ways to shape behavior uh but uh i i don't think this is going to work out the way they want
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:56.000]   what'll happen is is you'll annoy unsophisticated users who don't probably don't even know that
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000]   they're doing anything wrong and so maybe for them it is a good thing but by and large anyone
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.320]   who's sophisticated is either going to encrypt their traffic they're going to vpn it uh nothing's
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:09.040]   going to change outside of to uh this is an arms race basically is what i'm trying to say there
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:15.120]   you can for 35 bucks you can have an independent review process after a few notices if you still
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:20.000]   think it's not you oh you have to pay you could pay 35 bucks to have somebody review
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:26.320]   that now this is a racket this is how you make money let's establish our own judiciary system
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:31.040]   and let's make it where you have to pay 35 dollars for the privilege of saying the words
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:36.080]   not guilty really that's the problem i have with this is you're guilty until proven innocent
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:41.760]   well i think i i think it's i think it's an okay it's not an objectionable idea in principle
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:47.520]   i just think that i don't think anybody familiar with this sort of thing is is confident that uh
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:52.240]   it's gonna that the stuff being targeted is going to be illegal content exclusively and people who
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:58.080]   are guilty exclusively i i think that it's it's an it's an okay idea if it is truly an education
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:03.840]   system where i think that well one of the things that the the recording industry is afraid of
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.480]   isn't the people who are just going to figure out a way to get game of through
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:11.920]   game of thrones for free immediately without paying for hbo or dvd's or blue rays no matter what
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:16.960]   i think they're more afraid of that guy teaching somebody who is kind of unsophisticated oh well
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:21.600]   it's really easy i don't know why you're paying for hbo here's it's you're there no consequences
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:26.160]   it's easier and here's and here's how to do it uh kind of the way that uh it's now really really
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:30.880]   really difficult to simply take take make a color photocopy of a twenty dollar bill and print it
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.960]   on a color printer uh you're not gonna you're not gonna block the people who are interested in
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:39.920]   counterfeiting you are gonna block the people who are kind of silly and wanted to do this because
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.720]   hey one let's see if this will work so if that's their goal then that's kind of an okay goal i'm also
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:50.000]   think that you should be paying for game of thrones if you're if you think that you are entitled to it
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.480]   and you're you know and you're there's some people online who will tell you that oh well
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.400]   if you're damn them for charging me money for watching some of it should be free on
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.440]   television if you're upset with that you shouldn't be but i think that you should but you should have
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:08.160]   a system in place so that the people who are being naughty are kind of educated not to be naughty
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:12.320]   but you can't restrict the freedom of people who are just going out their normal business let's uh
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:19.680]   let's just let uh let the uh movie industry speak for itself here is a little video they've made
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:26.400]   on the copyright alert system process here's how content owners know what's being shared over
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:32.480]   peer-to-peer networks and how a copyright alert makes its way to subscribers content creators
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:38.480]   join public peer-to-peer networks and use keywords to locate and identify digital files of music
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:44.080]   movies or tv shows they own once they see a song or video being shared they confirm that it's the
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:50.880]   entire song movie or tv show not just a portion of it in order to confirm that the file is an entire
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:57.680]   copy it is downloaded and reviewed for example in the case of a movie so it launches key pieces
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:03.200]   and records information about the video file creating a unique digital identifier called a hash
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:06.320]   private content owners claim this video i know i'm gonna guess you're gonna get
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.480]   you're gonna get a little bit of your internet play in this without authorization they identify
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.440]   the internet protocol or technical address of the computer or account sharing the file this is
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.520]   where the problem is where the internet protocol address is assigned to an internet service provider
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:26.400]   or ISP content owners notify that ISP and the ISP determines which subscribers account was
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:32.640]   assigned the address at that time the ISP then passes the information or alert onto the subscriber
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:38.640]   no personal information about the subscriber is shared with the content owners at any point
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:45.600]   content owners save the information people ever see photographs and have the evidence needed if
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.880]   the subscriber chooses to challenge and alert the copyright alert system is designed to discourage
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:56.320]   illegal content sharing on peer-to-peer networks and promote legal sources of digital content
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:03.760]   please support the creative work we all love by accessing and sharing it legally on p colored
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:09.200]   computers i know i like the truth all the pirates are using yellow computers here's what i don't
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:15.680]   understand you're telling me all of these uh isp's can get together on the same page to to create
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:20.000]   this kind of draconian thing but they can't all get together on the same page to create some kind
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:25.840]   of uh you know revere revenue sharing opportunity to where uh part of your ISP fee is that you buy
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:31.120]   into a general fund that acts like a BMI ass cap type of thing and distributes the funds according
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:35.280]   to whatever is being downloaded the most it's like there are better ways than what we're doing right
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:43.760]   now and and something that smacks of draconian 20th century methodology just just stinks just smells
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:48.080]   right it may it may even be a good idea i'm not gonna blame you but it's like you got a smelly way
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:53.440]   of going about it gentlemen well but it's what i'm curious about is what if i'm watching i love
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:58.720]   watching the the capture videos from from Beatles rock band like some great music videos for Beatles
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:03.840]   songs but technically i'm lists to an entire Beatles song on youtube does that count as a strike
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:10.080]   if i if if you're watching a google hangout and somebody has music playing in the background
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:16.080]   does that count as a strike so it's i'm not confident from past performance that they're
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:21.760]   gonna do this such a way that once again people who are trying to if they if the system is perfectly
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:26.400]   designed to only trap people who are trying to get away with not paying for stuff they should be
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:30.240]   paying for then that's fine but then you know that's not gonna be how it's gonna work
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:36.000]   the thing and you know brian was talking about how it's gonna be an arms race where yours
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.080]   where the sophisticated users are gonna figure out how to get around this one of the ways they're
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:47.040]   gonna figure out how to get around this is to spoof the the addresses and sort of make their own
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:52.000]   activity appear to be some innocent person's activity yes and now all of a sudden it's gonna
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.680]   be a way that you screw over this this jerk who cuts you off on the 405 you find out his ip address
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:02.960]   and you mess up his whole is you you corrupt his account basically or you do it randomly but
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:08.720]   anyway i think i i suspect that the sophisticated users are gonna uh you know the the obvious way
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:15.520]   to get around this is to is to have is to be somebody else is to spoof another person's
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:22.400]   identities now but this this is just like you know the the the first three four reels of like good
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:27.280]   fellas where the crit where they can't just i just i just i just want to run i just want to like run
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:31.280]   errands for the local crime boss and then now i'm just delivering packages for the local crime
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:35.360]   boss these people are saying all i want i'm just frustrated that i can't see game of thrones for a
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:39.440]   year until it gets released so i thought what's the harm and then we're up to i have to spoof
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:44.960]   and there there there there's a monastery two doors away that has an unsecured Wi-Fi if i download
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:48.560]   in there from their parking lot then the months will get this shut down and not me but
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:56.720]   exactly that's exactly what's gonna happen so this is another story that i thought had a more
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:04.160]   appropriate conclusion although a very sad story did dannica patrick is uh is uh Daytona over
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:11.360]   she went yeah eight eight place eight place okay uh so yesterday and i guess these were qualifying
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:20.800]   or events yesterday but of course a horrific crash on saturday and somebody in the uh uh very
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.680]   near to where that tire landed exceptional footage yeah this is what you're going to get
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:31.680]   more of with google glass is unbelievable you can count on uh getting a lot more awesome footage
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:38.000]   like this and horrific well it's horrific so the car broke through the barrier the engine and a tire
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.480]   and a lot of debris flew up into the crowd and there are some people were very seriously injured i
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:47.840]   think somebody with life-threatening injuries uh but the point is this video fan shot video was
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:55.360]   posted on youtube and nascar pulled it down claiming copyright violation now really it's not a question
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:59.840]   of copyright violation later nascar said well we didn't what we felt bad for the victims we didn't
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:04.960]   think it was appropriate for them to to see that video which i understand but again not a reason
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:12.000]   to pull it down google decided to put it back up and uh i think that was the right thing they
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:18.160]   reinstated the video they said nascar had overstepped its bounds uh that in fact it was not a copyright
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:23.280]   violation oh what did they overstep their bounds by claiming copyright for something that clearly
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:28.160]   they didn't own the copyright to the half-n-et of public event how could that be what a bold decision
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.800]   google congratulations yeah well they said the justification they used is that when you purchase
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:37.600]   a ticket to this event it's in that that microscopic print that of course everybody reads before they
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:42.080]   enter the venue they say that well you we this event that you're if you take pictures you can do
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:46.080]   if you're personally used but we essentially own license the rights to it so they're they're
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.000]   saying that well because of a shot on an s-car event technically we own that property and so
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.720]   that's how we're gonna do well that's probably true if i took a pictures of the super bowl that the
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:56:00.080]   nfl could say well you can't put that up although they don't usually as a practice do that exactly
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:07.360]   but this was obviously you could say that nascar was trying to protect uh the the sensibilities of
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:15.520]   uh the victims families i think or trying to protect nascar and yeah exactly maybe not hurt
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:20.720]   ticket sales to future events i think i think there's a chat room in the chat room they're calling
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.320]   me out right now as a libertarian they say well if that's a contract then you should be okay with
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:29.680]   it and i guess i am i guess i am but still it's like i think it is a contract and you did agree
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:36.960]   but this is there is also an over over riding i think social interest because this is news footage
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:43.280]   and so there is an overriding interest uh that society might have even though copy
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:48.960]   strict copyright law may say you know you can't take a picture of that riot in that mall because
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.240]   you're in a mall it's not a public place but there is a overriding interest from the point of view of
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:59.840]   of news footage yeah and people and they should be at least savvy enough to realize that they're
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:04.080]   not going to be able to control this for more than about ten seconds so they may as well let
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:08.400]   it be posted i don't think anybody would doubt that the reason why they wanted to spike that video
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:13.200]   is because it showed something horrific happening to this what's being promoted as a very family
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:18.560]   friendly fun american uh pie sort of event and without acknowledging that maybe sometimes the
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:23.200]   carnage that happens in the in the field is going to actually sort of sneak up into the grandstands
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:30.320]   but i mean how many times have we seen that phrase uh we want we we have no comment because we wish
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:35.760]   to protect the privacy of the nine-year-old wheelchair brown cancer patient whom we decided to strip
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:40.960]   search in public and our tsa line uh that that's a that's a line that really has to be banished from
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:46.800]   all pr pr handbooks from now on because nobody's buying it matthew engram writing and content points
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:53.600]   out that uh this is an example of the the fact that dm ca favors the copyright holder it was pulled
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:58:01.440]   down automatically due to the dm ca um yes google reversed it but really what we have a right to see
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:07.280]   and what what is okay is really determined by these massive companies um and jill jillian york of
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:12.800]   the eff and others jason potton of the m at technology technology review say that our speech is to a
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:18.800]   large degree controlled by private corporations uh and i think that that's a good very good point
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:23.680]   okay well if if you're using the private corporations resources to communicate then yeah
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:28.960]   use your own use your use your personal learn but okay here's an example i mean twit does we you
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:34.800]   know this is private and we do it uh you know nobody controls us but but still we we you we have to
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:40.480]   use the public internet and and companies like ustream and jason.tv and others to get out there
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:45.760]   in youtube um they could really shut us down if they wanted to right?
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:52.080]   you got the difference between youtube shutting you down and like your isp shutting you down
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:56.320]   and there's a difference between your isp shutting you down and every isp shutting you down
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:01.360]   so i think that i have i have a little problem with the the amount of service that you're getting
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:06.320]   from youtube doesn't include that uh i promise for them that they're gonna post anything you
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:11.280]   post and they're gonna keep it up indefinitely so i think they're wrong but again i think that
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:16.640]   the your limitations to what we expect a corporation to do for you to continue to do when it's a free
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:21.840]   service you're not paying anything for yeah as far as the nascar thing like if there really is a
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.920]   contract with every single ticket and they really have covered their back sides on that and then
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:30.480]   they said they didn't want to do it um i'm not gonna fault them for being outside of bounds but i am
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:35.120]   gonna say that was a phenomenally stupid move for them to make and this is this is one of the things
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:39.920]   i like about private companies being involved because look how quickly that when when they see
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:45.200]   the way public sentiment turns against them uh corporations have a dollar reason to instantly
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:50.080]   flip around where you don't get that with government so if i'm gonna have to choose uh between you know
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:55.440]   gatekeepers i'd rather be a big corporate than than government yeah well that that's true it also
[01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:59.600]   we can't we can't necessarily we don't necessarily know how what the thinking process went at google
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:04.240]   it's possible that there is a latency problem uh and when they need to reverse the decision
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:08.720]   that it wasn't that oh well there's a huge outcry it's just a maybe it's possible there was just a
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:13.520]   period of time that has to go before a human being has to look at a highly automated decision and
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:16.960]   say oh wait no if that shouldn't have happened okay we'll just hit the undo button on that and move
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:22.240]   forward but but i agree with you i'm sorry i'm just doing some algebra here don't mind
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:29.120]   hi you're stuck you see you're you're in the casino you're just you're just a rat hitting that lever
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:34.080]   trying to get the food out there and i put that there dude i i just want to point out the end of
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:37.680]   the end of the day is to get into math because we were nerds not because it was fun this
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:43.280]   and the end of the day is making the case that uh that uh apparently algebra is sold out and now
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:49.920]   anyone can do it and it's no good anymore anybody can do it now yeah i i did i did my math on acoustic
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:57.120]   on a slide rule mister none of those electronic mumbo jumbo it's not a guy on stage with a laptop
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:02.080]   it's a guy with chalk dust and his beard at a blackboard yeah mathematicians
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:08.080]   it was miserable and we hate it and you have to hate it too we're gonna rack this up let uh
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:14.000]   mike go to bed in bar cilona in just a moment but first if you missed anything on twit you might
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:22.240]   have missed this previously on twit windows weekly you know this chrome book doesn't actually look
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:28.320]   uh that beautiful it's very i know it's boxing for that price it looks it's boxier than the first
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:32.480]   bonofa titanium power looks like a thing you know from years ago yeah yeah yeah yeah it is not a
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:38.560]   pretty machine i give him a little credit for being so weird but this is not weird this
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:45.120]   week in computer hardware like it's got an ivy bridge processor in it so what why do i i mean
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:50.800]   i'm running web apps why do i have an ivy bridge part of it all about android so you've got your
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:56.320]   boom sound uh with your with your ultra pixel uh in your blink feed so a lot of buzzwords that
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:03.280]   they just see one there but they're not gonna have a hard time marketing this twit live specials i
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:09.600]   think 4k support for games will be through probably a similar upscaling engine that they have in their
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:15.520]   blu-ray players and their televisions um to make maybe a game that's a little over 1080p or is native
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:22.160]   1080p because most of our ps3 games are upscaled to 720 or 1080 right now anyway twit tech just like
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:28.640]   you like it this was a good week if you're into tech and we covered it all and i hope you watch
