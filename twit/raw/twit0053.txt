[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Maybe it's just me, but I think if you got a bunch of girls together to live in a house
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   to play video games.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You wouldn't be video gaming, would you?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I'm just thinking it looks just like a frat house.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   They're probably no different than a bunch of guys.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   They probably sit around in their box with shorts, drink, and beer, play in games, right?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   No?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   That's about right.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I wouldn't say I mean...
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Why wouldn't they be there?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Why would you think like Chardonnay is being served?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Come on.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's like a little guy.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I'll try to frag something.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I could tell you that right now.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   So Viya, I guess what has hired them or is sponsoring them?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yes, we're sponsoring them.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I mean, they're all pretty good gamers.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   They want some stuff at QuakeCon last year.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It's like a promotional thing.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Viya gets their name associated with these cool gamers.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Are they hot?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I hate to ask them.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You can't reduce it that way.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   You're playing into the stereotype.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   No, no, it's not.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You understand it.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It's not me.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I don't have any interest, but I know our audience would want to know.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So I'm...
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   A couple of them are hot.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I think when you just say, you know, the Swedish female professional gaming team, right there.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   That just says it all.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Sold.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   All right.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   So anything else besides the girls of destruction that's going to be exciting about E3, I will?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Oh, well, PlayStation 3.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It tends to be...
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   We.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.480]   Well, now the Wii is clearly just an attempt to get some press at E3 because they don't have
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.000]   anything to say except the new name, right?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Yeah, it's a bit strange, but PS3, apparently they're going to have the new PS3 controller.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It's not going to be that boomerang thing.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   They're going to do a new one.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And that's going to be there.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And they're going to have some playable revolution titles on the floor so you can go and actually
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   try out the weird controller and use it as nunchucks or whatever.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   That should be quite cool.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   What does it look like?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It kind of hangs, right?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   There's a hanging part or...?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I'm trying to...
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Are you talking the Nintendo booth?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   No.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Are you talking...?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   No, the PlayStation 3 controller.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Do we know what it looks like?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   The PlayStation 3 controller, the concept one looked like a boomerang, didn't it?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Yeah, but they're...
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And it was really, really weird.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It had really long handles.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And everybody hated it.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Everybody hated it.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And so they're coming up with a new controller.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   But interestingly, the only reason that they're doing that is because they had a lawsuit about
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   the DualShock controller, didn't they?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Which they lost.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Which was saying that...
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   The immersion corp?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   The immersion actually owned the technology in DualShock, and so they're having to change
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   their controller.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   That's what companies do invest in.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Hey, well Microsoft has already invested in them, isn't it?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Microsoft's own board.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Importantly, I mean, immersion owns...
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Can you say some can add into any form of force feedback or...
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Wow.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   ...rumble.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Wow.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   You can put in a controller.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But that's true.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I remember the "Robert".
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I remember the "Robert".
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   The "Rocis" is the gaming console.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I kind of remember when we first saw the first immersion device.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   It was the first...
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   ...force feedback.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Well, that kind of scene, yeah.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Yeah, the first immersion device.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I mean, the first feedback device.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I mean, immersion used to make these big arms that you used to digitize.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   We actually had one at Lucasfilm, and you would digitize...
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   You could digitize 3D objects by touching on different points, and it would build those 3D models.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And so that's where immersion started.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And I think they were kind of...
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   We thought that they were all going to kind of fade away, because as we started doing laser scanning,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and other things, we weren't really using that that much.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And then this force feedback came in, which I think is...
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   They're mostly supporting by either licensing or suing.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Well, it's funny, you know.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I mean, I think that Evans and Sutherland and Lockheed would have some sort of prior art
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   on force feedback of any kind whatsoever.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   You mean for big flight simulators that they might have built for the Air Force?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I mean, those guys, they've been doing crazy stuff for almost 50 years.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Interesting.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I think that it was...
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I don't think that immersion came up with it.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I think that they bought somebody who had been doing it for a long time.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   So somebody else who had the patent, maybe.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Interesting.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Anything else?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Okay, so we're going to see the new PlayStation controller.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   We're going to see the Nintendo Wii or something like it.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Xbox 360...
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It sounds like the only announcement is what that HD DVD we talked about last week, anything else new.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And then a lot of...
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   They'll have a video, Halo.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And they'll have Halo.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Yeah, it will only be out in the 360, I guess.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Oh, really?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   This is Halo 3?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Yeah, it's there, Sam.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Like, three months ago?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Oh, yeah, the 360.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   You don't have an account, a permanent, like, a gold member account.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   The whole week of E3, everything's free, so...
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Jump on them and some fun.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Yeah, it's quite good because they're putting on, um...
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Like, the demos that are going to be at E3 and stuff, they're actually making available on Xbox Live.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   So if you don't get to go to E3, you can still see some of the cool stuff that's there.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Which is really interesting.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And nobody's ever really done that before.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I mean, you get sometimes cover discs, don't you?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Of videos and stuff from E3.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But they're actually making loads of that stuff available for anybody to download on live.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I love that idea.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   You know, I had to say, you know, the Xbox Live team has just been firing with all cylinders from day one.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It's the one thing they've really got right.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   They've really got 360 right, and this is the one that's kind of saying this.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   You know, I mean, they've really got it right.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   My office mate, he's got a 360, and just the stuff he tells me just blows my mind.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Well, but Chris also has a background in gaming.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I mean, before you went to Google, you were designing a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Yeah, because nobody had done that before it turned out.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Not today.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Yeah, I did that for about a year and a half.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I watched this stuff with interest, I'm sure.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Oh, yeah, very much so.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Do you game?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I was at E3 a couple of years ago.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Yeah, it's fun.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Do you play games?
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I do sometimes.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I have a daughter and a wife and a drop, and so games kind of come last.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   But I'm first in line for Half-Life 2, preloading it.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   You know what I'm first in line 4?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   I am so excited about...
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Have you looked at the videos of Will Wright's new game, Spore?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Oh, yeah, the Spore stuff.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Spore is mind-blowing.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   It's hot.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Do you want to describe it, Chris Force?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Well, you know, there's actually a video up on Google Video and many other places, I'm
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   sure, where, you know, it shows like you start off at the sub-molecular level, you know,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   with these single-celled organisms or whatever, and they...
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   End of Rome and Grovald.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And then you have these little animals, then you have little villages, and then you've
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   got villages killing each other, and then you've got rockets and space and, you know,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   solar systems and galaxies and the whole premiere.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   You know what I like is that the choices...
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   It's hand-to-justice.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Even at a single-cell level will then follow through, so your creature will evolve based
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   on the choices you've made all along.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Right.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So the real question is, can you make this fun, right?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I mean, that was...
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I mean, when you first looked at SimCity from a distance, you'd be like, "Well, why would
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   someone want to play with it?"
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Play with that, but I mean, the first time I touched SimCity, I lost like eight hours.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And the Sims is very compelling, but this seems like something Will, who did SimCity
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   and the Sims, has been building up to his whole career.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I mean, this seems like the culmination of...
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I'm actually...
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   You could go so horribly wrong, though, couldn't it?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   It could be so atrociously...
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It could be SimAnt.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   It could be...
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I'm so terrified of the game because if it's remotely good, I'm going to lose hope.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Yeah, which is worse.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Which is worse, is if it's terrible, or if it's really, really good...
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I'm rooting against it, because man, I just...
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I don't know if I could deal with losing that much time.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It looks like the ultimate game, which is...
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   It has elements of gameplay, but it's also very open-ended, so...
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   You can add...
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   You can make a three-legged creature.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   That's one of the videos that everybody's seen, although there's some new ones that have just come out,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   but you could make a three-legged creature, and then everything from then on...
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Has to support three legs.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   So your buildings, your cars, everything you do after that is determined by the fact that you made a three-legged creature.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Sounds like a total time sink.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I can't wait.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   But a fun one.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I cannot wait.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   So that's the one...
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I'm not so worried about Halo 3.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I'm worried about Spore taking up all my time.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Yeah, you know, they can't be good for fun, but they weren't...
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I'm really hoping I need Sony's shows off some of the online components.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   The online components for PlayStation 3.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Because I mean, the hardware is not final.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   The big deal, the controller is getting redesigned, and there will be some playable titles,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   but I just... I want to see what they're doing in terms of online.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Do they have a release date?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Yeah, like in November, isn't it? It's like holiday.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Yeah, they're not going to make it, in other words.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   They're saying before the end of the year, but now that the Blu-ray stuff has been pushed
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   down yet again.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And there was a language here?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Yeah, there was a segment that the cell processor is being a real, real pain in the
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   answer to a mic.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Oh, I bet.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Yeah, and Sony kind of has an history of cutting it really close with their development tools.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   So they should just say, "We'll be out before Vista, and that would be safe."
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   That's a safe bet.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   It'll be out of time.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   It's done.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Yeah, so I thought this was kind of interesting as a story that was just floating around really
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   more as rumor than anything else.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Microsoft has been talking with Yahoo about buying a big stake, maybe even the whole company.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   This is one way Microsoft, which certainly has, I guess, has the cash to do it.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   It seems like it'd be fairly expensive, although Yahoo's stock price has been fairly depressed.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   It would certainly be a way of solving Microsoft's search woes.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   What do you say?
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   It could cost you to buy Yahoo now.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   What's our market cap?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I'll have to go on a lot less than it would have been like five years ago.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Yeah, the stock price is tera has been tanking.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Let me go to Yahoo Finance.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And see what Yahoo's capitalization means.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I mean, it would be 47 billion.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   47 billion?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Microsoft really has that much in the bank.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   They have 56 billion in the bank.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   There you go.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   They could pay cash for it.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   They probably go straight.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   They'll have enough left over to buy EMI.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   That's 40% buy EMI.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Now, I'm going to start a rumor right now.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   What your focus?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   You heard it here first.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   What?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   I think it might be.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Google and Yahoo and Microsoft all three have enough cash to buy the entire music industry.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   I don't know how that's true.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   I mean, Microsoft sure.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I mean, they've got infinite cash, but you know.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Well, you'd, okay.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   So you give up a little stock.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Your stock's almost 400 bucks now.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   You've got a little stock.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   But truthfully, I mean, the market caps of those three companies are bigger.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.600]   I've been told I haven't done the research, but I've been told bigger than the market caps
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.800]   of the three big record labels.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:01.000]   You could effectively buy the music industry and just say, okay, it's a free concert, man.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   That'd be cool.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I mean, what would Microsoft get out of Yahoo?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.600]   I mean, what would it then like merge Windows live with Yahoo or would it?
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.000]   I think it's another AOL time Warner.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I don't think they could swallow it.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   No, I don't think they could swallow it.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I think it would hurt both companies.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.700]   So I don't know that I buy it, but I think the best thing for Google would be if Microsoft
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.700]   bought Yahoo because it would just drive the company.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.700]   Exactly.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.700]   Exactly.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.200]   And Google just say, okay, have fun.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   We're going to be over here.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   You guys.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   What do you do on our thing?
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.000]   You know, you have fun trying to swallow that snake.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.160]   Oh, I mean, because I mean, think about it because Yahoo is not a small company.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.160]   No.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.160]   And neither is Microsoft.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.640]   They've always had focus problems for the last three years anyway.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.960]   Well, I, you know, so on two focus companies.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.520]   In Yahoo defense, they do quite well at attracting and keeping users.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.520]   They really do.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.160]   You know, I mean, I have more pages than anybody else on the internet.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.560]   They've been well challenged by Google and have responded well.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.080]   I think Yahoo maps responded to Google maps very well and is very cool.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.280]   Yeah, they're very Yahoo mail has responded very well to Gmail and has gotten much better.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.840]   Well, they're really into this web to stuff, aren't they?
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.880]   Which I guess Microsoft wants to be into because it's sort of the antithesis of what Google
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   is doing.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.160]   There's so much overlap though.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.720]   I mean, Microsoft live versus what Yahoo is doing.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.880]   There's just so much overlap.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.400]   I think that it's a bad.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.080]   It would be a mistake.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.960]   But I can totally see Microsoft doing it.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   What is this?
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   It's a form of floundering.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.840]   Well, I think that it's similar to when Netscape really picked up and Microsoft felt
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.840]   like it didn't buy someone, but it needed to do Internet Explorer.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   Right.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.240]   And it's almost a major reaction.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.680]   It's a hmm.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.280]   So they bought spy glass, right?
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.000]   And I forgot about that.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.640]   I forgot all about that.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.720]   But the thing is that they feel like they have to, their way of getting caught up again
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.560]   is to just go buy something.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.520]   You know, go buy something or build something that's just like theirs.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.800]   And they've been successful at doing that in the beginning.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.680]   But I don't think that I don't think it's worked out over and over and over again.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.680]   I mean, I can't explore.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.640]   Well, the things that make Microsoft really successful have been successful.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.720]   It's been the things that is developed from scratch from day one, office and windows.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.440]   It hasn't really done a part of those things.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.200]   I mean, what has it ever bought that's been successful?
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   That's a good question.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   I'm trying to think.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.800]   There's like the list of Microsoft acquisitions online.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   Let me see.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.880]   I mean, I just think I think that Microsoft, you know, made it was in the right place at
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.040]   the right time in the mid 80s when Apple was, you know, not clear of what it wanted to
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.000]   do and took advantage of it.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.720]   And I think they've been on that, that momentum for a long time.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.600]   I think it's also their realization that software is arguably the most important part of any
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   computer experience.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.040]   It goes beyond the hardware.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.000]   I mean, that's what people interact with.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.760]   That's what people, that is the experience is how good is the software.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.680]   And nowadays software isn't something you put on your hard drive.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.320]   It's websites, it's web services.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.720]   So to me, that's what that's the whole point of acquiring Yahoo.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.600]   Well, allegedly, but is it?
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.520]   I mean, it's one of those things like we're heading back into the thing client mentality,
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.520]   aren't we?
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.520]   Yes.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.960]   And I think the early 90s proved that thing clients.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.320]   Well, it's a different world now.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.720]   You're going to have some more of them.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.760]   Yeah, you're going to have microcla, micro formats.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.320]   You're going to have, you have, I think it is very different.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.920]   What was that number Alex?
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.920]   You came up with this.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.440]   How many people on the internet?
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.680]   194 million.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.680]   That's what.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.440]   Three quarters of them are Chinese.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440]   694 million.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.080]   Actually, 10% of them are Chinese.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   Really?
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.040]   Yeah, I think 72 million are Chinese.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.400]   That's a really good question though.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:44.440]   Is this just the return of the thin client, the network PC, which is common and gone every
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440]   10 years?
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.640]   I think there's a lot of excitement around the idea of the internet app.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.880]   I'm not sure if the web is the solution to that.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.240]   I mean, if you look at, I'm a very strong opponent that iTunes would have never succeeded
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.760]   on in the web.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.760]   No, it's a desktop client.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.760]   Very much so.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.760]   And you watch these other ones.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.760]   You watch an appster.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.320]   You watch these other services that are trying to do the same thing.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.120]   And beyond having a different business model, the experience is so much lower than iTunes
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.600]   that you just, as an iTunes user, you can't even imagine using it because it's all, you
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.560]   know, I open up another window and then I wait and then I look at this window and then
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.560]   I wait and it's just, it's horrible.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.280]   And if you think about it, the parts of iTunes that are most frustrating are the parts that
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.600]   are loading online while you wait.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.280]   The more cash the better it would be.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.280]   That's a good point.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.320]   Like, you know, when you go to subscribe to a podcast or try to find a podcast, like
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.680]   say, Floss Weekly with Chris Bonet, then you find yourself, you know, hitting that subscribe
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.280]   button and then you have to start over if you want to find something else.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.280]   It's a little weird.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.280]   Why can't you hit that?
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.280]   It's a little annoying.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.640]   Actually, in the iTunes space, there's a couple of big stories.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.200]   One Napster is offering free music.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.440]   The first five plays of any of its two million songs are absolutely free.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.120]   Obviously, this is the last ditch attempt to win audience away from iTunes.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.680]   Smells like flop sweat, doesn't it?
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   Yep.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   It's going to be connected to the internet.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.720]   Most of us want to listen to our music.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.680]   That's the copy that's sitting next to our computer.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.720]   That's that copy that darn Windows media copy protection scheme, which requires that you
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.280]   certify that you own it.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.280]   Right.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.400]   And you've got to have the player that's compatible with it if you want to take it anyway.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.160]   And once again, you know, it opens a player window.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.240]   So you have to find the song on the website and then you hit another thing and then it's
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.240]   going to open the player window.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.080]   If you want to listen to another song, you have to go back and go back to the web page
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.480]   and then you go back to the player window.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.760]   It's not like iTunes doesn't have copy protection, but it's just much less intrusive.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.760]   They get out of your way.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.920]   It's one of those things like iTunes works because even though it does have copy protection,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.000]   the chant and even though it does have lots of restrictions and stuff, the chance side,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   you will never notice them.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.640]   Because even if you just buy off iTunes, you buy off iTunes, you put it on your computer,
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   you put it on your iPod.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   That does what you wanted to do.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.880]   I think there's a fundamental way that they look at that the different companies look
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.880]   at this.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.560]   I think that most of the companies that got into the music space, Microsoft, when they
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:59.360]   look at their DRM, they thought, "How do we cater to the industry so that they'll
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.640]   give us more music?"
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.800]   Where Apple is, "How do we make it easy for the consumer and how do we force the industry
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.080]   to do it that way?"
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.760]   And so Apple goes to loggerheads with them, but they're looking at how do we make the
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   experience better?
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.080]   Well, the other ones are looking at, "How do we make it easier for the industry to step
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   over?"
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.000]   And it's just two very different ways of approaching it.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Big news from Apple's point of view.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.240]   They were able to talk the record labels into sticking with 99 cents a track.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.960]   The record labels were making a lot of noise about wanting variable pricing, pay more for
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.240]   current hits, pay less for old songs.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.560]   I don't know how Steve Jobs does it, but somehow he got into the table.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.320]   All the contracts were up and yes, he got them to agree to 99 cents.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.560]   In fact, Apple shares jumped 2.9% on the story.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.840]   Big, big news.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   Now this is interesting.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.320]   The big four labels make about 70 cents a download.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.320]   Wow.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.320]   And I...
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.520]   Do you remember Visa makes 25 cents a download?
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.480]   So Apple's making a nickel at best.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.200]   Well and then take out the Akamai costs for the bandwidth, which is very expensive.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   I think Apple loses money, probably loses money on every download.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.360]   I bet you they don't lose money, but I bet you they don't make it.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.600]   They make no more than a penny or two.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.600]   Well, here's a question.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.760]   What did Steve have to give the labels?
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.160]   Did he have to give them more money?
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.960]   No, you hit them with a piracy stick.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.720]   It's like everybody's got an iPod and if they're not filling it with legit music from
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.120]   all the service, they're going to be filling it with pirated stuff and then you're not
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.120]   going to get anything.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.120]   When I think through...
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:38.720]   Steve Jobs is the big swinging club when he comes into these meetings now, doesn't he?
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.920]   I mean, Apple's the seventh largest reseller of music in, I mean, overall, not just online.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.400]   The seventh largest music reseller in the United States.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.680]   Like Sam Goody walking into the meeting saying, "We're not going to stop selling records unless
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.680]   you guys agree."
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.000]   I mean, that's a big deal.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.760]   Yeah, and I think that's it.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:00.120]   It's funny if you look at when they first started selling music via the iTunes Music Store,
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.920]   the record companies were going around telling everybody not to pirate and there's lots of
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.440]   legitimate ways to get music and everyone's like, "No, that's BS.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.440]   Show it to us."
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.680]   So he went to them and said, "Listen, people are pirating.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   They're saying you're not doing it.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.040]   You're going to come under FTC, you know, screw a knee.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   Let me sell your stuff.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   Here's the price."
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.040]   Right.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.960]   And they probably thought, "Yeah, whatever.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.960]   We know how to sell music.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   You can get your people done."
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   Right.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   And they said, "Sure, whatever.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   99 cents.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   Who cares?"
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.960]   Maybe that's what happened.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.040]   Maybe the labels really, that's what happened.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.840]   They said, "Oh, it works."
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   I guess it's not such a bad thing.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.840]   Yeah, once they started working, they started getting greedy.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   Right.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.560]   Well, that's when they say, "Yeah, now we can charge at Buck 39 for Britney Spears."
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.600]   So it works so well for Rhapsody.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   So this is a question.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.920]   I mean, are we sure that this is a good thing?
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:48.520]   Because from my point of view, if I'm not buying what's ever in the top 10, I'm probably
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.120]   not buying Britney Spears or the--
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.520]   No, I think I like the idea of a cheaper, old song.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520]   So cheaper, older stuff.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.520]   It's good.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.520]   I wouldn't have minded it.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.080]   If I could go and get one of the old Chili Peppers albums for like maybe 60 cents or something.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.920]   Maybe Apple didn't do us a favor.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.240]   Maybe Apple did not do us a favor.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.640]   Maybe it would have been variable pricing would have been a good idea.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.320]   But on the other hand, I don't know what it's like in the States, but in the UK, older
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.160]   stuff always costs more.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.160]   Really?
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.440]   And stuff in the middle is kind of not bad and the new stuff costs more.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.520]   So it would probably open it up for-- it would get worse in the long run.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.360]   But at the moment, I wouldn't have minded cheaper, old stuff.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.800]   So are you in Santa Clara right now?
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.960]   Is that what you said?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   Go down to Rasputin Music.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.960]   The other's in the collar bin.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.960]   Oh, what is like 17 billion?
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.960]   Yeah, 17 billion.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.800]   Back to England to a little bit of CD arbitrage, you know?
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.360]   It's funny because in the States, people are always looking for imports, right?
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.760]   You've got to get the imports.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.280]   And they cost like $50 the vinyl imports.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.240]   Nobody ever likes what they've got.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.840]   But what it means to me is that everybody in the States always complains about cinema
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.840]   prices, right?
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   And in the UK, it's way less expensive.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   It's way less expensive.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   It was like 25 pounds, man.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.080]   You pay more than 10 bucks for a movie?
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.280]   All right, how am I free this morning?
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   It was 10 bucks.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.400]   And I would pay 10 pounds in London.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.600]   That's like twice as much.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   That's absurd.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.600]   $20 for a movie ticket?
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.440]   Oh, no, no, and you got to tell them how long the commercials are.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.760]   Oh, the commercials are beginning.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.280]   They're at least 20 minutes.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.280]   What are they?
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.600]   Line your popcorn bucket with gold?
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.600]   What are they doing in there?
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.600]   I mean, that's crazy.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.720]   No, it's way more expensive than UK.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   And it was like 20 million.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   It always makes me laugh.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.640]   And you guys were always like, oh, you're DVDs are so expensive.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.080]   And you know, DVDs are more expensive than England as well.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.320]   So if you think you've got about it, well, they're--
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.800]   Do they still do the national anthem at the beginning of the movie?
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   No.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.320]   Good.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   That's what you're paying for.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.760]   You don't want to have to get up and sing God's say.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.040]   Yeah, it should replace my coke commercial.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.160]   So who gets that money?
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.080]   Is it the exhibitors?
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.600]   Is it the movie companies?
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.840]   Who's the greedy?
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.440]   I think it's the theater owners.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.960]   Because--
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.960]   Everyone's got their hand on them.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.120]   If you've got a massive theater in the middle of London,
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.520]   you're paying how much in rent is going to be astronomical.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.160]   I mean, property in England is so much more expensive.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.040]   But correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.960]   The way it works in the states, I believe,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.560]   is that all of the ticket sales go to the movie company.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.200]   And then the exhibitor--
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   It's not all.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.920]   It's a large portion of it.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.760]   And the exhibitor is--
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.360]   And it goes down--
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.800]   --profit that's really on popcorn and coke and all that stuff.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.480]   OK.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.200]   Well, I don't think we have quite the same popcorn and coke
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.400]   culture in England.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.320]   Well, you've got to work on that.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.880]   Your movie price is a good answer.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.160]   Actually, you know, it's interesting.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.800]   If you add up what it costs to go to a movie in the states,
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.040]   if you include popcorn and coke, it's probably not much more.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:28.480]   Yeah, man.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.640]   Much less, I mean.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.320]   You have to walk away from the popcorn and coke.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.440]   You get to have bucks for a box of candy, please.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:34.920]   That's crazy.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.760]   Maybe it isn't such a big disparity.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.040]   It's just that we pay money in the other way.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:39.800]   Yeah, it's all about the--
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.640]   Are the theaters in England at least nicer?
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   Do they have good screens and nice seats?
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.840]   It's not good sound quality.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.480]   They're all right.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.000]   But it's really hit or miss.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.760]   I mean, there are some places that are real diets, obviously.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.440]   And there are some places that do like great--
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.960]   you can go to some great places in Kensington, in London,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.600]   where you can go.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.640]   And they've got a really nice screen, really nice sound.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.840]   And everything is armchairs and little tables.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.720]   And you get like way to service at the beginning of the movie.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.080]   They're going to bring you alcohol and stuff.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:05.920]   Nice.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.360]   So a couple places in LA like that.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.320]   I'd pay 10 pounds for that.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.680]   So I have a theory that this is actually why
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.440]   cargo pants are seeing a resurgence now.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.040]   You can put a lot more in your pants and go to the movie.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.600]   You can smuggle more sweet tarts in those pockets.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.840]   Yeah, I've actually been able to make it in there
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.040]   with a Starbucks coffee without spilling it in my cargo pants.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.680]   This is completely not tech.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.360]   Well, it is--
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:26.880]   Yeah, you can.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.000]   If you have a broader definition tech.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.840]   No, no, fashion's really important.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.160]   There's some guys that are making something called a beer
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.200]   belly, which if you strap onto your gut, it looks like you're fat.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.040]   But inside, you've got beer.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.000]   And it's for going to ball games, movies, concerts.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.080]   You just figure out-- there's another--
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.600]   It has a little thermal electrical around it.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.640]   Exactly.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.680]   They call it the beer belly.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.120]   And what are they going to do?
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.960]   Feel everybody's belly?
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   They can't, right?
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.040]   They think you've got a hard belly.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.320]   Well, I'm stuffed.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.520]   I've got eight brahwests.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.640]   So the big rumor going around is that while everybody's
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.280]   paying attention to E3 in Los Angeles,
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.840]   that Apple's going to announce their new MacBook
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.960]   line up in Cupertino, is this nuts?
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.600]   Is it going to be Tuesday, Alex?
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.240]   We're going to be there Tuesday.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.520]   Are we there Tuesday or Wednesday?
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.080]   But the--
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.400]   Aren't we going up there Tuesday?
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.440]   I think it's Wednesday.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.240]   I think it's the day we're going over there.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.680]   But I think that--
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.160]   Oh, OK.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160]   So we may miss it.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.240]   We may miss it, or maybe be able to shoot some stuff when
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:26.600]   we're there.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.760]   But yeah, it's supposed to be--
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.280]   the little MacBook is supposed to come out.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.680]   I mean, I think that--
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.400]   I think Apple just wants to release it as soon as they're
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:33.680]   ready.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.240]   I don't think they're really concerned about--
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:35.920]   They don't care about E3.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.800]   --what's going on.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.920]   I don't think E3 really fits into there.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.840]   We're pretty sure it's--
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.800]   You're Apple people, all right?
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.280]   So there's people walking around--
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.760]   Not all of us are Apple people.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.120]   Well, no, I don't mean that in a weird way.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.360]   You know more than I do about Apple,
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.520]   is how I should have said it.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.840]   So what's kind of the big deal here?
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.160]   I don't get why them revving their MacBooks from.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.680]   You're obviously not an Apple person.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.360]   Chris, do a core matters.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.240]   You're not an Apple person.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.840]   It had a little arm that gives you a little head massage.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.640]   Is this the ultra portable notebook?
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   Well, I don't think so.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.560]   The teenage white is just a smaller.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.800]   It's going to be an iBook.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.120]   It's just a little smaller than--
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.600]   It's the white polycarbonate--
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.480]   --highbook, whatever.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.640]   Here's the thing that's surprising to me
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.360]   is that this MacBook supposedly would be a duo.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.040]   And instead of a Corsolla, which I thought it would be,
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.760]   that's how you would differentiate on price.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.640]   I think it's actually getting harder to buy Corsolla's--
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.280]   --sollos, no one wants to sell them.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   Nobody wants to sell them.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.040]   And so Intel's made them really, really, really cheap.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.000]   Interesting.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.200]   Like there's an N100 ThinkPad, which I just got my wife,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.000]   which is in the mail right now.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.760]   It's a Cordo, and it's $700.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.320]   So it's like, what's cheaper than that?
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.240]   It's $600 for a flip and thinkpad.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.760]   I think the MacBook is going to be really--
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.880]   I know we're going to get one for our CFO here.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.680]   And specifically because of the dual boot,
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.040]   being able to-- she needs to be able to use Quickin,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.640]   which has a Mac version or-- well, QuickBooks, I'm sorry--
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.480]   which has a MacBook, but it has a Mac version,
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.520]   but it doesn't really work.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.600]   We're pretty sure this is this rumor.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   It's true because there was a slip on the Apple website
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.360]   in which they actually put a link to a MacBook, not a MacBook
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.200]   Pro, but the rest of it, we don't know the facts.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.480]   Well, the listeners can go to the Twitter 53 Delicious
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.480]   tag and go right to it.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.640]   So go and see it right there.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.400]   You mean a picture of it?
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.760]   Yeah, I mean, that's where the links do.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.280]   Oh, wow, I'll have to go look.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.680]   It's very useful, this delicious thing to yours.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.240]   The computer, she is useful.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.200]   She is useful.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.480]   The internet, who would have thought?
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.840]   The rumors, of course, are from Think Secret and Apple
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.280]   Insider, and they say that this would be this 13.3 inch
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   wide screen.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.800]   I would probably buy that if it's cheap enough.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.760]   That'd be awesome.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.680]   I mean, the 12 inch with a 1024 resolution,
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.200]   the 1024 resolution is just too low.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.960]   But a 1024 or a 13 inch wide screen with like 12 80 by 7,
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.800]   6, 8, that'd be sweet.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.320]   That's good.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.240]   I'd take that.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.400]   That'd be great.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.920]   I'm going to have the pick the camera in it.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.360]   Apparently, it'll go over into the--
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.000]   there'll then be like a MacBook Pro that's like 13 inch,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.240]   and we'll have the same kind of form factor.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:10.440]   According to Apple Insider, Aces is going to make them.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.520]   Not Kwanap?
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.960]   No.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.000]   Aces makes decent, but not great notebooks.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.800]   What's your opinion of the Aces notebooks?
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.440]   Have you guys reviewed them?
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.800]   They are solid, if unspectacular in general.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.160]   And they make a couple of really nice little widescreen models.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.960]   The one that I really like is they
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.800]   showed me a prototype a few weeks ago, which
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.120]   was entirely in Clad and Leather.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.520]   It was a leather-band notebook.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.920]   You would have come all the Kat and 9 tails.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.960]   And it was really nice.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.000]   It was like, if you have like--
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.600]   I don't know if you guys have--
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.000]   if you have an expensive leather wallet,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.960]   it's got that really lovely texture on it.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.200]   And they had one that was in there,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.160]   like a really nice tan leather color.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.640]   And then they had one where they treated it.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.400]   And it was really like bright pink leather.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.960]   What about that?
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.600]   I don't know if something like that.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.320]   It was awesome.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.040]   It looks like a blanket.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:57.920]   Robert's got a good point.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.400]   It's going to get pretty hot, isn't it?
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.760]   But I guess if you've got a cool duo or something
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.600]   that runs quite cool, you can get away with it.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.240]   Hey, have you felt the new MacBook Pro?
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:05.880]   That ain't cool.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   Oh, well, that's not cool.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.440]   I think it's hot.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.160]   All my friend at work was disassembling
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.960]   his checking the heatsinks on it and everything.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.040]   Just making sure it was all--
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.240]   he got about three quarters of the way it disassembling it.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:15.760]   He gave up.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.720]   He was just like, OK, he just bought it.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.200]   I don't know.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.280]   I was impressed that he even opened the thing to begin with.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:20.840]   Check that out.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.800]   I think that's insane.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.600]   That's what I said.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.400]   And he finally gave up on it, put it back together.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.800]   And then he took some $100 bills
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.520]   and started burning them for fun.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.200]   There you go.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.000]   Did you see that Islamic militants are now using first-person
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.400]   shooters to recruit terrorists?
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.600]   Who put this article in here?
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.080]   Is this from you?
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.520]   That was me.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:45.920]   It was one of those things where allegedly Islamic extremists
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.520]   are using-- do you know Battlefield 2, the computer game?
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.400]   It's quite easily moddable.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.800]   And so they modded it, basically,
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:57.040]   to have an Islamic extremist awesome army
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.200]   and then the American infails.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.680]   Do these actually exist?
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.200]   Maybe you've got to go along somewhere
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.240]   and they give it to you on a disk.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.880]   If the quality of the mod is good,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.600]   the content's almost irrelevant.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.440]   But it's not--
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.560]   No, but what's the playability of being a suicide bomber?
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.440]   I think they should bring out back bomber man
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.600]   or a suicide bomber, too.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.160]   A suicide atomic bomber man?
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.760]   But I mean, it's not--
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.400]   Lemons.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.680]   Really, from the Americans using America's army.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.200]   Sure.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.320]   That's basically propaganda.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.360]   That's total propaganda.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.680]   But it's a big game.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.240]   I think this is one of those stories that's too good to check.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.680]   We don't really want to know.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.000]   You know?
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.600]   And then boom.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.800]   Dan Devlin, the Defense Department's public diplomacy
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.400]   specialist, says--
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.680]   I'm quoting--
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.680]   "Bittech.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.120]   He believes this kind of strategy will be employed more
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.240]   and more as terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda utilize technology
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.000]   to spread their message."
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.160]   So Will, where did you get this story?
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.040]   Oh, crocky.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.720]   This is your reporter, Ryan Garside.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720]   Is Ryan reliable?
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.880]   I'm on the link.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.040]   No, it was definitely linked somewhere else.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:04.560]   All right.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.000]   Yeah, he's left from Yahoo News.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.920]   Oh, there you go.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.920]   Right.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.000]   If you say it's--
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.120]   So it's Reuters.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.920]   Yeah, so he reported me from Reuters.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.440]   I'm not going to say a word.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.080]   I was going to say something like, but they make stuff up
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.160]   all the time, but that would be like this.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.240]   So I'm not going to say that.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.240]   I don't think it's true anyway.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:21.800]   I'm sure they're very--
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   Internet reports in not reliable shock.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:29.960]   My space, speaking of shock--
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.200]   Not reliable shock.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.840]   This is from Valley Wagg.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.200]   So again, consider the source.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.280]   What's wrong with Valley Wagg?
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:37.800]   Ah.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.360]   He seems obsessed with women.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.720]   I, you know, like--
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.960]   He says like the poster about--
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.360]   Larry Page's girlfriend.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.040]   It's all about Larry Page's girlfriend.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:46.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.240]   So tell us a story here, because I actually
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.000]   have a Reddit--
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.600]   The story on this, I read it, is that there's
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:57.160]   this guy, this chap called Trent Lipinski, who is a--
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.680]   basically, he's sort of a student.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.640]   He's a want to be journalist.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.680]   And he did loads of research into my space
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.520]   and how it started and to what actually went on.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:15.000]   And the theory is that the two guys who are the poster
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.160]   children from my space-- I can't think of the guy's name--
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.560]   is it Mark Anderson as I'm working?
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.440]   I can't remember, yeah.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.200]   Tom Anderson, sorry.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.040]   Basically, they sort of created the idea,
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.080]   and then they sold it to a company, which basically
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.400]   was a spam company.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.640]   Right.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.120]   And that--
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.000]   Crystal Wolf and Tom Anderson.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:31.960]   That's still right.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.880]   And they basically sold it to a spam company.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.280]   The spam company developed it into my space.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.520]   That's right.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.760]   And that when Murdoch bought it, all the money
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.680]   went to the spam company.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.600]   It's basically how about--
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.040]   Intermix Media got all the money.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.640]   And we actually talked about that a couple of weeks ago.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.800]   And it's basically about how Tom Anderson and Chris
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.520]   are basically a bit of a sham.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.440]   They're just nothing more than a front, really,
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.680]   for this spam operation.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.440]   Oh, interesting.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.800]   So really, it has nothing to do with--
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.280]   but he's not saying that they aren't doing what they say
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:01.800]   they're doing.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.120]   It's a fraud in one sense.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.960]   So allegedly, my space has already threatened this kid
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.120]   with a defamation law.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:07.960]   Oh, great.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.880]   Yeah, you don't mess with Rupert Murdoch.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.640]   And he claims that he's going back
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.920]   to try and have decent journalism and journalism standards
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.400]   to go and do these things.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.240]   Interesting.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.360]   All right.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.600]   How about the blue spam story of you?
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.480]   Followed this one.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.880]   Blue Security is an Israeli anti-spam organization,
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.760]   which has a kind of unusual way of fighting spam.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.680]   They have what they call a do not intrude list.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.800]   Almost 500,000 people have signed up
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.880]   for this do not intrude list.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   And if you're on the list and you get spam,
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.200]   essentially they spam the spammer back.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   They send message after message saying,
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.440]   take this guy off your list.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.320]   Take this guy off.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.480]   They send so many that, in effect,
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.160]   they're de-dossing the spammer.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.400]   Now, actually, it's not the spammer.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.160]   It's the sponsor of the spam.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.960]   The person who-- the spammer probably
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.400]   is a hired hand, a hired gun who is brought in
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.720]   by a company that wants to sell something.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.200]   So they'll flood the sponsor.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.040]   It's hard to get back to the spammer.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.880]   However, there is a spammer, a guy named
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.760]   pharmamaster thought to be a Russian who
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.800]   has responded this week with a de-doss attack against Blue
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.120]   Security's own system.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.080]   And furthermore, took down a TypePad
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.760]   because the Blue Security blog was moved to TypePad.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.160]   So he's been launching attacks like crazy.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   And you don't want to wait.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.800]   I kind of don't blame him.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.960]   You're playing with fire.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.040]   You start de-dossing people.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.120]   You're going to get de-dossed back, right?
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.520]   So the thing is about this kind of thing
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.560]   is that if you're going to spam in response to spam,
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.240]   isn't that just like the sound you're in response
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.720]   to your spam for that spam?
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.440]   And it's all just a huge waste of man within you.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.520]   On the other hand, you've got to like any technique that
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.400]   actually pisses off spammers, which it has done.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.800]   Does this actually do that though?
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.600]   It doesn't seem to slow it down at all.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.120]   No, you're right.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.360]   It hasn't really worked, hasn't.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.520]   In that sense.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.720]   It just needs more people.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.360]   And it certainly doesn't work for these.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.840]   I don't buy this at all.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.200]   I'm more proud of Blue's fan for trying something new.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.120]   So gay them.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.440]   Good.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.200]   But in the end, I just don't think it matters.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.000]   I had to--
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.800]   It's one of those things.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.360]   Once you're on the list, surely you're more likely
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.960]   to be spam because there's a list of all people in one place
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.480]   who have valid email addresses.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.400]   Isn't one of those things that you should never really
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.360]   unsubscribe on the matter with spam mail?
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:34.720]   Because then they--
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.200]   I made a mistake.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.560]   It's a really email address.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.840]   I made a mistake of saying unsubscribe me from one email.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.840]   You know, I got one email.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.560]   Never, never, never.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.760]   Unsubscribe me.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.560]   This was years ago.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.920]   And now, you know, I just get hundreds of them.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.560]   And it was--
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.000]   I had nothing until then.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.600]   That's one thing I love about web-based email nowadays.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.880]   At least with my Gmail account, I never
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.120]   see anything in my inbox that doesn't belong there.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.120]   And very, very rarely.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.400]   You said that you get no spam?
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:57.880]   No, no.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.400]   I do.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.400]   I mean, there's a spam folder that fills up.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.400]   And I used to delete it out.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.400]   But I just don't care.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.840]   Of course, all your friends are wondering
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.600]   why you're not responding to their emails.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.280]   No, I do check it once in a while.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.760]   You know what it turned out with Google?
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.480]   If you're an actual Google employee
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.680]   and you have that dot Google on your email,
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.920]   if that goes into a Gmail account,
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.880]   Gmail puts up this crazy red message saying,
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.560]   you should be really careful about this particular user.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.920]   They might be impersonating company or blah, blah, blah.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.800]   And it actually flagged that one somebody I know who actually
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.080]   works for Google sent me an email.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.640]   And it totally flagged it and dropped it into my spam account.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.120]   Has that--
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:33.920]   What about that, Chris?
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.000]   Did you try using that?
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.760]   Yeah, send us some email.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.480]   No, I've never heard of this.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.360]   My god.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.720]   Here, I can actually-- I still have.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.120]   I've saved it just because the--
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.160]   And it highlights it in this bold red text.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.240]   And it was just like, OK.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.280]   So what are they saying?
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.040]   They're saying, because it comes from Google.com,
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.280]   it may be forged.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.300]   Totally.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.040]   Here, I can hold that.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   Email will allow you to email from a known good address.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.880]   So it'll send a confirmation email to it,
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.120]   and then you can have that as be your reply to it.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.620]   Right.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.680]   But maybe they put some special logic that if it's
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.120]   replied from Google and it's not a certain list of servers
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.560]   that it flips out, I don't even know.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.320]   Maybe just part of the standard anti-fishing stuff
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.400]   got weird.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.680]   I have to admit, one of our ISPs,
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.840]   we have a bunch of different servers
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.000]   in a bunch of different places.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.200]   But I get mail from different mail servers.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.560]   And one of them, though, blocks is so tight about blocking
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.200]   the stuff.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.840]   I have a friend of mine who can't send me email
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.440]   from his normal address.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.640]   And they're like, well, we can't really turn it off
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.480]   for one person.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.440]   Or they don't have any way of really managing it.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.320]   And I'd rather just get all the mail and sort through it
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:35.840]   myself.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.560]   I mean, it doesn't take me that long.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.600]   The only time I get upset is when I'm on dialup,
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.560]   an Africa or something.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.640]   I'm getting 600.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.280]   Here it is.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.080]   Warning, this message may not be from whom it claims to be.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.040]   Beware of following any links in it or providing the sender
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.160]   with any personal information.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.480]   And that was somebody who works that I know that works at Google.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.240]   So it's an anti-fishing--
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.200]   Is that me email to my Gmail?
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.080]   It's an anti-fishing--
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.000]   With another error on this.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.960]   That's awesome.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.800]   That's funny.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.680]   They assume that if it comes from Google--
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.160]   I wonder if you got it from paypal.com or citybank.com,
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.120]   you'd get the same warning.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:05.880]   It probably would.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.040]   It's an anti-fishing warning, right?
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.160]   Yeah, that's what it sounds like.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.080]   I mean, I'm not on that.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.000]   You know, it may be totally irrelevant because according
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.840]   to Frost and Sullivan in seven years,
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.040]   the internet's going to be broken anyway.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.120]   We're going to run out--
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.920]   Running out of IP addresses.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.000]   There are no more left.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.240]   Yeah, I'm scheduling a vacation for that week.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.720]   You know, they don't actually give a date.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.320]   But they say 2012, there will be 17 billion devices connected
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.640]   to the internet.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.120]   And that's about how many addresses
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.200]   there are for IP version 4.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.000]   So we're going to have to all move to IP 6,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.360]   because it's only 32-bit addressing.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:49.120]   So IP 6, which is 128-bit addressing, that'd be enough.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.560]   Isn't that loads of dead space so that we could use up?
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.640]   You know, I think it's bogus.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.120]   I'll have to look at this article,
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.640]   there's research report.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.360]   But what people have been saying this for years,
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.960]   but what happened was routers.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.880]   And for a long time, we thought, oh, there's just not
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.720]   going to be enough IP addresses.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.400]   But that's when you assume that every device on the internet
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.120]   would have its own address.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:13.360]   But thanks to routers and NAT and DHCP,
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.240]   how many devices do you have in your house that's on the net?
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.400]   But you only have one internet address.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.520]   At least half a dozen.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.880]   So I think, in fact, it's much less of a problem
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.680]   than anybody thought it would be, which is why IP v6 hasn't
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.720]   really taken off.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.640]   I'd agree.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   And even things like offices mostly run.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.960]   You can have an office of like 200 people running off one
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.760]   one address.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.520]   So I know this is Frost and Sullivan.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   I mean, they know what they're talking about.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.160]   But I don't know if that may be one of those Malthusian
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.160]   skies falling predictions that, in fact, doesn't hold up.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.120]   I mean, all the current browsers, I believe,
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.240]   already support IP v6.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.600]   Yeah, it's the routers that don't.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.480]   That's the problem.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.920]   The whole internet infrastructure would have to be replaced.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.840]   That's OK, though.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.800]   Who cares?
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.280]   I don't know.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.760]   It'll be all replaced by that anyway.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.520]   I mean, I'll have to be.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.120]   I think so.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.280]   I think by that way.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.400]   The way we were getting off this extra spam from Blue,
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.520]   whatever.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.200]   Well, I have to because it blew Blue's spam.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   Steve Soderberg said at a panel this week at the Tribeca Film
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:22.320]   Festival that he's going to use BitTorrent to release a short.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.480]   I think that's great.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.880]   I think any of you never saw that one student film of his.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.800]   Oh, is it really bad?
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.720]   What was the name of that?
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.800]   So now I have to go to IMDB.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.400]   Because he did--
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.440]   I mean, he's done some great movies.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.480]   My favorite, I mean, traffic.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.080]   Traffic is a really fantastic--
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.000]   So what you're head to explode, you should go and see--
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.760]   Oh, gosh, where is it?
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.840]   This is a student film.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.320]   But is that what he's going to release, or is it-- no, it's a new short he's doing.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.680]   He's going to do a high-def film, Alex.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.240]   I love it.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.000]   And it's going to come out in mid-May.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.640]   It's part of the next issue of a DVD quarterly called Wolfen.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.680]   Actually, he's shooting the 950s, which are the same camera.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.360]   He's using the same HD cameras.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:03.960]   They're the one that we have.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.720]   And we use for Mac break.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.680]   That's cool.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.960]   Well, no, the reason I like it is because it's a Hollywood establishment guy saying,
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.760]   no, BitTorrent can be used for things other than piracy.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.880]   Well, I think it opens the door.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.520]   I think Hollywood should be more afraid of this than they are of people downloading
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.400]   illegal movies.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:23.280]   Because a lot of what keeps Hollywood-- a lot of why we see the same movie over and over again.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.840]   And why a lot of this is problematic.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.560]   I mean, why Hollywood is fine with the system in some ways the way it is,
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.800]   is because the constrained supply of distribution keeps them in business.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.640]   If anybody can put out a movie that is HD resolution to thousands and thousands
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.160]   and thousands of people, it very quickly starts to diversify the market,
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.200]   which was going to cause it.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.920]   It makes it much harder to make a blockbuster, which goes back to what George Lucas said about,
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.600]   you know, movie being more than $15 million.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:59.200]   But as we've learned from Mac break, which is we do a 1080p version,
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.080]   it's hard to find the bandwidth for these massive files.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.920]   Well, when we do ours in BitTorrent, Mac break is going out in BitTorrent.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.560]   It's the only effective way to do it.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.600]   Right.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.480]   Although we have had cash flies approached us.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.040]   I don't know.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.800]   Did you tell cash fly how many terabytes they've had to serve?
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   That wasn't for the Mac-- that wasn't for the--
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.200]   I don't think they'd have any interest in doing the BitTorrent one that way.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.000]   Because they--
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   No, but for Mac break.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.600]   For Mac break for the little one we were talking about.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.000]   Oh, the little one, though.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.760]   I don't think they were-- if we were talking about it,
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.840]   we made it direct download of the HD version.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.880]   We probably be burning through like 50 to 100 terabytes a week,
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.480]   which would be problematic for whoever was--
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.880]   Nobody could really do that.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.400]   And that's-- the interesting thing about BitTorrent is that when you're talking,
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.280]   it really is designed for this mass market distribution.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.120]   Because the more people want it, the easier it is to download it.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.760]   It actually works better with popular content.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.160]   That's its flaw.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.600]   It doesn't work well at all with unpopular content.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:51.960]   Right.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.920]   But it was a rumor that I saw this week that the next version of OS 10
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.600]   is going to have BitTorrent built into it.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.760]   So I'm like, oh, I read that somewhere.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.520]   The rumor is that it's going to be-- it's not going to be actually something
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.760]   that all of us can take advantage of, at least at the beginning.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.320]   The rumor is, if it happens, is that Apple's
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.760]   going to use it to distribute very large files.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.440]   We don't know what they would be, but they might look like movies.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.320]   And you would-- as the rumor goes, you
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.360]   would be able to-- Apple would be able to distribute stuff using your computer,
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.680]   and you would get some kind of points for making it available.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.880]   So it would be a volunteer in-- you could say, I want to be part of this.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:29.520]   And you might get discounts on music or free songs or something.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.400]   I see game companies doing this already.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.600]   World of Warcraft uses a system just like that for distributing
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.400]   what was that last patch, about 300 megs.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.440]   And if you enter the details of the actual download process,
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.200]   it shows who you're connected to.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.960]   And they've set that up and down.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.840]   They've been using it here to appear for a while.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.480]   But I think it's-- isn't it troublesome for a big company
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.720]   to do that without somehow compensating?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.280]   I mean, I think that's been the problem.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.560]   I think that's what Apple would--
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.160]   the rumor is that Apple will offer discounts on stuff at iTunes.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.520]   I mean, you'll get something for it.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.480]   Those of us who use BitTorrent realize it really
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.040]   isn't a big burden on your system.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.640]   I mean, it's not a lot of data.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:10.920]   However, I think people are kind of nervous about having somebody use their bandwidth.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.520]   If it's set up properly, the user would never know.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.600]   It's when it's sucking up all of your uploads, and then that, in turn,
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.560]   would just affect everything you're doing.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.480]   Even if you try to surf to a page.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.120]   And if a developer like Apple has enough control over the clients,
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.760]   what it means is that they can very softly distribute this out to a lot of people.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.720]   So they can send it up to 10, then 100, then 1,000.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   So it's not something that it hits any one computer very hard.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:41.280]   You do a staged rollout of the contents that no one servers doing a lot.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.040]   Stage rollout is the thing that's missing right now for most BitTorrent clients.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.560]   And it's just hard because you can't-- you just don't know who's going to be available.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.360]   I still think it's not really how much it hits your system that concerns people.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.560]   It's just the mere idea of it.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.800]   Yeah, but I'm paying for it.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   Why do I have to help you?
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.280]   Right.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.240]   But we know that Macs are a Macintosh.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.960]   Well, the thing is, Mac users would be the type that would just kind of go,
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.440]   "Sure, Apple.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.000]   Anything you want.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.200]   Let's take over the world."
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.600]   Anything you want.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.560]   How can I play?
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.360]   You think that really--
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.360]   I am Steve Jobs' Cabana boy.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:13.760]   It's the case, though.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   It seems to me that if your performance in your download, you're able to browse quick.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.440]   And I don't know the upload part that really doesn't--
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:21.960]   I don't even think about it personally.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.800]   No, when I run BitTorrent and I keep running all the time, it hardly does-- it impacts it
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.800]   at all.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.120]   So I should admit at this point that I'm really, really terrible at BitTorrent.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.120]   I'm bad at it.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.120]   You're a bad BitTorrenter?
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.960]   Yeah, I think that BitTorrent just doesn't work for me very much.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.960]   No, no, no.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:36.960]   You know what?
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.520]   It's everybody because people talk about it as if it's this holy coming and you realize
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.160]   that very frequently the files come in extremely slowly.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.400]   It's not unusual to see when you're downloading a BitTorrent file.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.640]   Yeah, you'll get that next week.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.800]   Yeah, when I see 2K, I'm like--
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.080]   That's very common.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.320]   Unless it's really popular content.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.680]   Or somebody like Apple has a lot of seeds and a lot of clients out there.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   And that's really--
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   It can work for 100,000.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.320]   If Apple can persuade 100,000 people to play, it would be pretty profound.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.240]   Once Twitch seeds-- I mean, Twitch's a good example.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.000]   Once we seed, we'll have several hundred seeders.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   It's very quick.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.240]   Nobody is doing a-- has a burdensome amount of downloads.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.680]   It's hard when I first seed it.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.120]   I'm the primary seeder.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.560]   And then the server gets its copy.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.160]   It becomes a seeder.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.480]   And so it's slow at first.
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.600]   So if you first try to download Twitch in the first few hours, it's slow.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.040]   But by the time-- by Monday morning, it's fast.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.640]   It's very fast.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   It's also too-- a lot of people don't realize that if you're behind, if you're using a router
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.960]   and you're dealing with not addressing and everything, most of the BitTorrent clients
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.720]   require you to port forward specific ports for better performance.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.200]   And that can be an issue too.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.600]   Some of the better clients actually tell you exactly what to do.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.440]   But I think Google's doing bandwidth shaping to you, Chris.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.440]   That's why it doesn't work.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.440]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.000]   When I do try to BitTorrent, something I try to do it from the server in this massive
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   thing.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Ah.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   All right.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   I'm not really a pirateer.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.800]   I have too much stuff with my own that I've already digitized and I haven't gotten time
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.120]   to watch.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.600]   I think people who really download a lot of stuff, it's a collecting thing.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.920]   It isn't because you're going to watch it.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:11.920]   Yeah, really.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   Oh, I've got that.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   I think there's a lot to do there.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:20.720]   Hey, real quickly, before we wrap up, CBS now joins Fox and NBC as the big networks all
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.080]   move to distribution over the internet.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:28.400]   CBS's inner tube, which may be the worst name I've ever heard for a television distribution
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   site.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.400]   I don't know.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   It could have been called Wii.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.320]   Well, the worst thing is they don't own innertube.com.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.040]   That's owned by a tire company.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.040]   So bad.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.240]   So you have to go to CB-- you think they could have come up with something they could
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   have had the--
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.080]   Don't they have any marketing people in television?
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.080]   Morons.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.080]   That's probably CBS online.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.080]   I don't know.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   Inner tube.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.600]   Anyway, go to cbs.com.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   Inner tube.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.880]   And you'll see that they, in fact, offer a lot of programming and in fact, they're going
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.000]   to offer the Brady bunch, old stuff.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   They're going to offer new stuff.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.040]   They're going to offer pilots of things that have never aired.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:05.160]   They've got shows like Greek to Sheik, which never intended to air.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.720]   Some interesting stuff, but it's all streaming.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.720]   Oh.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.440]   Is it at least widescreen for the HD shows at least?
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.320]   Yeah, that stuff will be widescreen.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.320]   But it does not fullscreen.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.320]   I hear you.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.280]   I mean, not necessarily full resolution, but at least the widescreen format.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.560]   The aspect ratio is wides.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.400]   And they don't have as many spots, which is nice.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.280]   They kind of do a light spot load thing.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:35.760]   I think that it may be just because I travel a lot that I'm so sensitive to this idea
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.800]   that I have to be connected every time I need to--
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   I don't like streaming.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   --it's something that's just really, really frustrating.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.520]   To me, streaming is a whole pausing and rewinding thing.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.560]   If you want to go back a little bit, usually that'll break a stream and then you're sitting
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.720]   there, caching, caching.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.640]   Streaming is what people who don't get it do when they want to do internet distribution,
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.640]   in my opinion.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.520]   But then this is coming back to the idea that we were talking about a thing client, isn't
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.520]   it?
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.880]   I mean, Alex was just saying, I don't want to always be like, it's not connected to do
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.880]   stuff.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.880]   And so thing clients have only got a limited thing because until we get to the point where
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:11.640]   literally everywhere it has an interconnect connection, then this isn't really going
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   to work.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.840]   You're going to want to have stuff on your own machine and do stuff on your own machine.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:15.840]   Well, I'm on an airplane.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.840]   I want to watch it on my laptop.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.400]   I don't want to watch it off the internet.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   Well, right.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.600]   And for reliability reasons too, especially in a home environment, there are reasons
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.040]   you wouldn't want, say, a home media server touching the internet directly.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.680]   You would rather have it with the content that you've stored on it and to be able to
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:36.920]   access it without having to worry about potential hacking or anything else.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.200]   Yes, it's not to have my wife listens to this show.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.080]   Wait, wait, don't tell me it's like some NPR thing.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080]   Yeah, I downloaded it.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   It's great.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.080]   It's great.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.080]   But you can get a via podcast or you can listen to it with real player.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.080]   Who's going to listen with real player?
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.680]   And then it's like, well, why don't we try it just with the podcast?
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   And it's just it's perfect.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   You know.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:59.400]   And I think that it's not just having the bandwidth, I mean, having connectivity be ubiquitous.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.800]   It's also having it be fast enough.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.880]   You know, ubiquitous and fast enough all the time to watch video.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.640]   And like when we look at like we just made the latest Mac break, we actually uploaded
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.160]   the podcast at 960 by 540.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.480]   And you know, that's everyone's going to get a big surprise.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.000]   And the that's pretty mean.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.600]   You mean the iPod version is five is not an iPod version anymore.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   I guess it's not big.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.080]   It's just the podcast version, but it it it's a podcast.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.080]   It's not a podcast.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.080]   It's broadband video.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:33.800]   And the but we figured out how to make it as small as as a regular podcast.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:38.280]   So I mean, for the same, it's like 10 megabytes more than the 320 360 by 180.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.280]   Wow.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.920]   Yeah, it took a lot of.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.480]   It's a good number.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.480]   Is that the cell?
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   The cell.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.560]   Yeah, it's it's a great one.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.960]   And and we but we figured out how to there's a bunch of technology stuff that we've been
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   doing to squish it down.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:56.280]   And but the main thing is is that still at 95 megs, you know, it 24 minutes, that's
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.280]   really great.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.600]   And still the band with you would need it.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.400]   It's great to download it and watch it later.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.280]   And it looks really big on your screen and it looks gorgeous and you can read the text
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.800]   on the screen and all that fun stuff.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.320]   But it's it's not something that you're going to be able to stream anytime soon.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.200]   And so all of us keep on watching all these videos that look nasty when you look at all
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.600]   these streaming content because it doesn't you know, number one is the compression that
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:23.760]   that macro media is using or not macro media Adobe is either you either have to make it
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.320]   really big or you have to make it look really bad.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:30.280]   And there's not the the spark and the in the on to just aren't efficient.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.560]   They're not nearly as efficient as age 264.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.280]   And that's going to be like sites like sites like YouTube are just proving that people
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.480]   don't always care.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:42.160]   No, happy to have it pixelated and look like rubbish because they just they just want
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.600]   to be painful enough when they're not playing on YouTube.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.200]   They just live on it constantly.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.160]   But I think that once you start once you start having something else there once you start
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.960]   having stuff that's higher quality, I think people will get a little more picky there.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.480]   There's just there's just nothing else out there.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.320]   Everyone want to watch wants to watch video.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   They have broadband and that's available and it doesn't cost them anything and they don't
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.480]   sit through a bunch of commercials.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.520]   But as soon as that changes, people are going to get and as soon as someone else starts
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.560]   to put up higher quality video, people are going to get a lot more picky.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.280]   Yeah, this goes back to E3.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.000]   You know, I guess one of the things they're going to do there is try to hype their particular
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.640]   brand of HDD VD.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.880]   Both Microsoft and Sony are going to go ahead with that.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.440]   Yeah, I think we'll get players there.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.920]   You know, they get a player on Monday.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.920]   Or tomorrow.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.400]   Yeah, an HDVD player.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.400]   You're kidding.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.920]   Is it going to be the top?
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.480]   Yeah, great.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:34.200]   I'm just I'm happy to have it as a high quality source and I'm more I'm also getting a HD
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.160]   satellite hookup for the lab and I'm going to be very, very curious to see the same movie
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.920]   delivered in HD over satellite, compare that directly to the HD DVD format itself.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.920]   I've been under well.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.320]   I know which is going to look better, but I just want to see it in person.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:51.400]   I've been under well, but I had a dish HD for a while for review and it is you know, it's
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   DVD quality.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.560]   I will you know what next week we'll talk about it.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.360]   That's I'm getting the new in pick for hardware too.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.720]   And that should be installed sometime next week as well.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.000]   So we'll do a high def roundup next week with Robert.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   That's great.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.640]   Well, I really like to be there because I have to tell you I'm loving.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.640]   I definitely.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   Isn't that great?
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.640]   I don't know.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   Like sopranos on it.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.640]   I'm spoils now.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.440]   It shows you never really think Oh, they'll be grew in HD.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.440]   It's like, Oh, this is really good.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.000]   Well, what happens is you just can't go back.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.520]   I mean, it's become the standard.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.600]   I'm really pissed.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.760]   I really think I'm fine.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.120]   I want sci fi to be an HD.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.880]   Yeah, I find myself watching some of the worst TV simply because it is an
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.480]   a my ami for instance.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.080]   Oh, and of course, I'm at work at 11 o'clock.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.240]   It's what is it?
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.040]   One of the soap operas is an HD and I don't have a sound.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   Rob, Rob, Rob.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.520]   No, but it's something to look at that's actually fleshy.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:43.200]   But it's what's quite cool because we're just about to get a HD in England.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.120]   It's just about to be rolled out next month.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.120]   You guys don't have it?
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.280]   No, no, no, we don't have it yet.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.920]   No, one of you could charge 20 bucks for a movie.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.640]   So we're really excited.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.760]   There are Sky who is owned by Rupert Murdoch.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.640]   It's just about to start transmitting in HD.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.400]   What is the penetration for HD TVs in Britain?
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   Do a lot of people?
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.440]   It's pretty small, but it's getting a lot bigger, a lot faster.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:10.360]   But it's really interesting because they're broadcasting exclusively in 1080i.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.680]   That's all.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:17.400]   And so it's really weird because virtually all the TV sold in the UK are 720p, obviously.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.280]   Sky is broadcasting exclusively in the 1080i.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.360]   I think it's fairly common.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:26.880]   I think on cable and the cable channels like ESPN, HD, I think they're most of the most
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   settled on 1080i.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:32.120]   I think it's so frustrating that we had a chance, as we moved to this digital era, to
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.120]   get rid of the interlace altogether.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.680]   I know it's all the day.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.680]   And eventually we're going to get there.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:40.000]   I think the people, as they start one up in each other, I mean, some of this are now
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.680]   being able to do 1080p, progressive scan, which means you're seeing every picture.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.600]   And I think that's everything progressive.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   Yeah, it is.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.800]   And all the sporting events and everything I see.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.080]   Wasn't the whole point of interlace because you didn't have enough bandwidth to show the
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.080]   entire screen.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.600]   And so you're going to do half and half.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.600]   Well, you could do half and half.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.040]   It's going to be too slow.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.640]   Every TV can do that now, though.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.960]   There's no reason for the interlace.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.960]   That's crazy.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.520]   I mean, they all compressed to the same bit rate.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:07.760]   It's just do you want twice the resolution delivered with half the data, in a sense?
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.400]   Or do you want that full resolution?
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:13.000]   But you're not really getting twice the resolution.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.840]   Yeah, actually you are.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.600]   But your frame rate goes down.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.760]   Well, it's the way it's delivered as that interlace.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.120]   You're getting every other line compared to getting the whole frame.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:27.360]   You know, I haven't ever sat down and looked at one compared to the other on a good TV.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:32.040]   But when you're looking at a monitor and a computer monitor, it's such a horrible looking
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.040]   interlace.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.800]   Well, it's different because the computer monitor by itself is still just showing.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.640]   Yeah, it's kind of making everything progressive.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.440]   So everything's going to look bad on a computer monitor.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.440]   So it's not up to the 1080p.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.360]   1080p is really the end of the road.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.680]   I mean, it's not the end of the road.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.000]   No, because you've got the red camera.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.880]   Now we're going to 2000p.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:56.440]   But the 1080p though is I think where everyone's going to end up.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.040]   And so, you know, like when we're looking at buying these, we're really making sure that
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.640]   they're compatible with the 1080p signal because I think that's what people are going
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.200]   to end up as they start, as the competition keeps on pushing them forward.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:11.320]   Well, we do we do it 1080p every once in a while on Mac break and you can keep it.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   They're all now.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.160]   They're all going to be a weekly 1080p and we got a new shoot schedule coming up.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.840]   Lots of shows coming your way.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:23.320]   Macbreak.com or you'll see them posted on Twitter.tv as soon as I get around to a poster where
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.560]   I have such a backlog now about my guests.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.680]   I can get up there all at once.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.520]   Robert Herron is on DLTV.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.520]   You catch his great work there with Patrick Norton.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.760]   Please say hi to Patrick for us and we'll talk next week about High Def.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:41.760]   I want to get your review of the HD DVD.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.760]   That'll be awesome.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.760]   I can't wait.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.400]   Of course, our good friend Will Harris who's visiting from Britain is going to be going
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:53.480]   down to E3 and maybe we can get you on for an E3 wrap up as well.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.960]   Yeah, that'll be cool.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.960]   See what's going on.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:56.960]   Bit-tech.net.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:04.360]   It is kind of the enthusiast site of choice in the UK.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.400]   And we're glad to have you on to talk about it.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:11.800]   Of course, Chris Dabona, our good friend who does Floss Weekly, our open source podcast.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.560]   We just did a great one with Miguel de Casa.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.560]   I like that one.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.760]   Oh, so good with it.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:23.000]   Miguel is the guy behind Gnome and now Mono talking about putting .net on Linux.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   He's absurdly fun to talk.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   It's great.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   I think it's a great episode.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.600]   That's one of the podcasts that's backlogged.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.640]   I will get out real soon.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.800]   We also have our first biotech podcast is done.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.360]   I just have to get it out the door.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.360]   Nice.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.960]   We're calling it futures in biotech.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:38.960]   Fib.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:39.960]   Fib.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.520]   And you know what we're talking about, Robert, was the thing that you were so interested
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:49.080]   in microarrays, the ability to put on a single chip the entire human genome.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.960]   And it's remarkable what they're doing.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.200]   We're talking about DNA, protein, and tissue microarrays.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.720]   Just the analysis tool alone.
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.320]   And it's the speed and the number of individual things they're able to analyze isn't.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.080]   Is this the asymmetrics one?
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.520]   It's the first step really towards personalized medicine where you can go in and get a drug
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.440]   or a therapy or treatment.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.600]   Exactly tailored to the issue at hand.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.600]   The genetics.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.600]   You've got this chip that can do a hundred thousand sites tested.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.600]   It's incredible.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600]   Exactly.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.440]   The record now is a hundred, nineteen hundred twenty something like that.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440]   That's amazing.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.440]   It is rocket science.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.800]   I mean, it's just awesome.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.440]   Well, tune in with fib.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.040]   We'll appear this week as well.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:39.600]   And of course, Alex Lindsey, Chris Dibona, Robert Heron, Will Harris will appear again
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.480]   on another This Week in Tech very soon.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.160]   And we'll be back next week with more tech news for you.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.480]   Our thanks to our friends at AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth for all of the Twitch
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.440]   podcasts at AOL.com/podcast.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.440]   Emily O'Lauport.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.440]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.440]   All right.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   I should have paid attention.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.640]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.640]   Too much work.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.360]   The problem is there's no limit.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.160]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.160]   So here's the deal.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.160]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a ton of blue screens.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.160]   Like forget it.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.160]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.160]   I'm killing you.
