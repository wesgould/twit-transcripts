[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.600]   Three of my favorite people in studio with us from connect safely dot org Larry Maggot great to see you great to be
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.580]   Al Jazeera commentator occasionally. Yeah, and still doing stuff on CBS News radio nice
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.000]   Yeah, and so we got him headphones, so he'd look like he was
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.820]   I feel much more comfortable if I'm radio than on television
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.900]   Unfortunately, these are Aunt Pruitt's headphones and he has a massive head
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.740]   So you look like a small child wearing ear muffs. Yeah, it's good look
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.780]   And I said this off camera, but I'll say it or on off Mike's a little weird that I could touch you
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.780]   This is the Leo is the first person I've been around other than my family without a mask indoors, so it's funny
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780]   How are real people smell isn't it?
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.580]   I wasn't gonna say anything that's that's Christina Warren. She is senior
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.220]   Advocate at Microsoft and we can tell from the stuffed animals behind you an animal crossing fan
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.020]   Yes, that's good. Um, no, they made these build-up hair animal crossing toys and I just had to buy them
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:32.300]   I was like there and Isabel Isabel they run the front desk in the city in the city hall. They're great
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.700]   They're your best buddies really
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.260]   Yeah, I want to get there's a few though. I need of my
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.540]   Residence that I need I have the goth
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.860]   Hypopotamus or something
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.460]   That's the vendor hard-o-r great to have you senior editor at end gadget
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.900]   Hello happy to be here last time we talked you would move to a lady happy
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.820]   It's it's good. It's very quiet. It's much slower than New York, but the piece is nice. You know, yeah
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.420]   You could park in front of your house. I can and inside the house. It's great
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.700]   Is that a wild experience after you've lived in a city? Wait a minute. My car's right here. That's incredible
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.740]   No, I didn't spend an hour looking for a parking space. It's amazing
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.940]   Great to have all three of you you have the github a little is it octopus to behind you? Yes
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.840]   Yeah, the octocat octocat because it's a cat with eight legs a cat with hit legs exactly
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.060]   Yes, github launch something in beta that is fascinating to me called co-pilot
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.380]   We've been talking a little bit about this
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:45.360]   The idea is it's artificial intelligence that will help write your code for you, right? Is that right?
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.660]   Yes, that's right. It's a visual studio code extension and it you know based on what you're writing can give you suggestions
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.260]   So like when you press tab, you know for some of your tab completion stuff
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.500]   It can give you some suggestions and it's really it's really good. It's uncanny
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.300]   I know for me like what I've been using it for is if I'm writing something in JavaScript and I'm using like an API that I don't
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.700]   Know or use very often and rather than opening up stack overflow or like the API, you know like a docs
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.380]   If I know a few of the kind of the characters and if I'm starting to kind of write what I'm trying to do
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.340]   It usually can do a pretty good job of inputting the rest of what I need
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.500]   yeah, github I mean a visual studio and
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.100]   Microsoft studio have had for a long time audit a lot of code auto completion
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.780]   Which is really nice feature where you just type the first few letters you hit tab and you can see the whole thing
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.380]   But this goes way beyond it. It's yeah, it's kind of like clippy
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.740]   Coding it's like well. I see you're writing a linked list
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:56.060]   We'll suggest code there's been a lot of conversation about it though because it's it's kind of it's getting the snippets
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.860]   From public repositories on github. That's the training
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.740]   Material right yeah, so so we use GPT 3
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.340]   Algorithm which honestly look like like and I'm not I want to be clear
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.380]   Like I'm not speaking on behalf of github or anything
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.020]   But from what I understand like that data set is available for anyone to use right anyone could use it's from it's from a
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.060]   Open AI org. I think yeah, yeah exactly open AI org and their GPT 3 algorithm and it's using the data set
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.500]   Which is you know the the code that is a public?
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.940]   On github now anybody else could use that and write something similar if they wanted to or build something else similar
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.500]   But yeah, that's that's what the training data is based on it's kind of it's a
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.780]   Picking of the future in some respect. There's there have been some interesting
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.580]   Anomalies but it is early days yet, so I'm not gonna hold it against it
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.860]   It apparently quoted some quake code that had a obscenity in the did you see that?
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.780]   Yeah in the comments yeah
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.500]   Well, I mean you have you had to be clear like to get that to come up
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.100]   You would need to be pretty specific about what you're typing in for the full things and it's not as if it's just going to insert that in
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.100]   What is more interesting to me is like when you just have a new file and what kind of the recommendations for that are
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.180]   It and it's it is fascinating to see and I think that as the feedback comes in from people who are because it's in private
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.940]   Preview right now as more people are led into it and this they get more feedback obviously they'll make adjustments to to what it does
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:31.140]   But GPT three wants to put divindra and larry out of business. That's the one that can also write pros
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:37.300]   Yeah, yeah, I've heard about this. Yeah, I think it can even write in fact. I think now already is writing
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:44.180]   You know sports updates. Yeah, because it's very easy. It's talk updates because they're very formulaic right
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.100]   Yeah, and I suppose it could you it could do general news headlines probably pretty easily
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.700]   Yeah, I don't know if it could do my obnoxious commentary can't do no see that's the thing it can't do that like
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.780]   No personality. Yeah, no well because people are freaking out
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.780]   Wouldn't they hear this stuff like oh, you know, it's gonna put writers out of business or coders out of business and it's like
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.620]   No a we're not at that point yet
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.460]   Is the idea to eventually get to the point when you could create net new
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:15.140]   Content that would be you know have its own kind of tone and personality. Yeah, are we there yet? No
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:23.140]   Even if we were to be at that place like I feel like the stuff that this is best at which would be things like sports square updates or stock updates or whatnot
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.460]   That's not stuff if you're a journalist. You really want to be doing anyway. Like that's yeah
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.700]   That's that's the that's exactly. I mean that's that's the intern or somebody else's job
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:38.740]   And so you know that that was always my least favorite part of doing you know stuff as a journalist was having to kind of do those
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:44.420]   Those fill in things and so I would be happy to pass that off the same thing with some of the coding stuff
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.060]   Like I don't have to access, you know my docs or or sack over for the answer
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.380]   And I can just get it and make this hidden writing
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.540]   That's the sad cases that a lot of code is just pasted from stackover. Yeah
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.220]   So this is probably better quality than that
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.460]   I would guess
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.260]   Um, it's interesting because we've for a long time
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:10.980]   I can remember in the very earliest days of programming and AI talking about computers writing their own code
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.780]   I mean that was always kind of the thinking is at some point we're gonna the point where humans don't write
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.900]   The code itself they write a description
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:25.220]   And this is kind of and then the computer writes its own code and this is kind of the step in that direction is interesting
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.860]   That's kind of like the Ray Kurzweil vision, right? Like we're just gonna talk and things will just be created. Yeah
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.340]   Uh
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.460]   This is probably something no one else cares about
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.420]   But computers are about to replace a business that I'm in
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.620]   Voiceover actors. Oh no
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.140]   Now you got a problem. You know I'm mad
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.620]   I you know, it's interesting to see automation slowly replace a lot of jobs
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.340]   But one job I thought I would probably be fairly safe in is uh voiceover
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.780]   This is an article from mit technology review. There are a number of companies well said labs one of the best
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.540]   known
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.140]   Which are taking real human voices. It's called prosody. They're taking the
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:15.460]   Real human inflection style and they're laying it over machine generated kind of robotic speech to make it sound human
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.940]   I don't know if i'm gonna be able to play these samples
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:25.060]   But but let me play um, let me see karen is the senior AI editor at mit technology review
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:32.500]   Covering the fields cutting edge research and its impacts on society. That is not a human. Yeah, it's not bad. That is not bad
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.660]   I'll play you um
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.660]   Another one here
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.900]   This is an AI
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.860]   Made to sound this sounds to me a little more robotic but i'm curious what you think made to sound like a customer service agent
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.220]   Thank you for calling our department store. How can I help you today?
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.660]   The little horseness pretty good that pauses the inflection audio books clearly
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.420]   There's no reason why you would need to hire an actor for an audiobook unless you wanted the personnel
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.700]   Here's from another company called vocal id they do ads
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.700]   At casper we've taken sleep to the next level
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:10.100]   Temperature regulation feels like sleeping with a cool. That's so good. You know if you're paying if you're paying that much for an ad
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.420]   Do you want me to read?
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.420]   Yeah, they want me to read. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.380]   AI says I slept in a casper last night. It's not that credible. I'm just saying
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.580]   It's not also it's not that much money to pay the voiceover artist for the ad. It's cheaper
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.660]   Yeah, you know, it's cheaper. Is it?
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:32.660]   Like an audio is it a really good voiceover artist is very expensive and there's residuals
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.260]   But on the other hand, there's people like me. I'll give it to you for 15 bucks
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:41.540]   So I was gonna say I mean there's there's a much bigger there's a huge there's a huge pool right now
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.900]   Yeah, you can go online. There's freelancers who'll do it for no. Oh, yeah. Here's another one. Let's see if this sounds better
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:54.180]   Feels like summer is finally here. We've got drinks and snacks for the whole family in aisle six
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.980]   Yeah, it's a little bit
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.060]   I thought it was interesting another place you get voiceover work is
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.300]   Video games a lot of video voiceover artists who do work for video games
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:12.420]   This is from a company called obsidian entertainment. This is a robotic voice listen
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:21.620]   I can see this hurts, but I had to tell you sooner forget it. I trusted you. But if you look at it, you never listen
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.820]   You don't listen
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.620]   Wow
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.820]   And what's also that wow that's better acting than most humans
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:36.660]   To generate that dynamically depending on the can play that's where it can that you couldn't normally you'd go in and you reduce
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.740]   Spend days recording thousands of different variations online and so forth
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:46.900]   Don't have to have a human anymore now. They're humans involved. These were all almost all created with humans
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:52.900]   Who did the prosody and got paid for that and it says in the article and they knew
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.180]   They're putting themselves out of business
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.180]   They they license the voices and they knew that they would they would get paid one
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.860]   It's like when a worker packs you get paid to pack up the machinery to send a china, right?
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.940]   Listen
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.940]   You got one more job
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.780]   So I think that's kind of interesting. This is something google's been working on they've they're there
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.100]   They're where I learned that word prosody was from google
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.580]   I also I wonder if people are just getting used to hearing more robotic voices now too, right?
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.940]   One of my favorite features is pocket pocket has just read me this article, right?
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.940]   If you're online it gives you really good digital voice for every single article
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:38.340]   And I just walk around and listen to very long pieces and it's not perfect. You know, it's it's synthesized
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.140]   But it's good enough that you can listen to it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, although all the flip sides
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.220]   I subscribe to autumn which is a subscription service love autumn and that uses
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.700]   And that uses humans well
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:56.260]   Because I think the difference here and I think maybe this is where we're going to is like the middle ground of like the just okay voice
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.500]   Voice stuff. I think maybe goes away and you have high quality
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:06.420]   AI generated voice or like in the case of autumn or some of the stuff on audible you have incredibly high quality
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.460]   Very good readers because the quality of the readers on autumn. They're usually like the best
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.860]   People that are on audible right and and it's like really really good stuff
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.620]   And I've compared because apple has um real human readers doing stuff on apple news as well
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.060]   And I listened to an article that happened to have been done on both places
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:30.020]   It was a New York magazine article and one was on apple and one was on autumn and the autumn one was
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:35.140]   Like it wasn't even a comparable thing. It was just you had a much better reader a much better person
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.620]   Um, and so like I'm willing to pay for that experience
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.180]   Would I be willing to pay
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.340]   For the lesser reading experience versus something that's good enough like pocket
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:51.460]   Maybe not but if you're able to kind of reach I think like kind of that upper echelon of the people that
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.940]   Dear point leo can charge more and get the residuals and are very in demand
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.580]   I don't think those people are going to be replaced by you know, uh, AI because
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:06.180]   The quality difference is still so good that if that's what you're after there's an audit. Yeah
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.900]   And some of the audible books they'll do accents, you know
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.260]   And affects and it's like listening to a play. I mean, it's
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.140]   There's any reason that a computer couldn't do that as well. I mean you could be eventually
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.380]   Yeah, I think the entry level folks are screwed
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.340]   Basically the people who are entrenched in like have a reputation and are notable are going to be fine for a while
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.180]   But they're they're like the dinosaurs of that age. It's kind of like digital cameras
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.860]   You know, there's still a market for $2,000 great cameras. There's no market for crappy $200 cameras
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.060]   It's it's like, you know, the the margins go away
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.420]   Yeah, it's about $5,000 to record an audiobook
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.620]   I you know, maybe it will only cost you $500 to use a robotic voice
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:53.780]   I think there are a lot of people would want the real human voice. Audible. Good example. Actually lisa
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.260]   I at least have discovered autumn and listens to it because it says New Yorker. It's the Atlantic
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:04.420]   It's it's good sources of and they're very well read as you said she said they're too slow because they're reading carefully and yeah
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:10.020]   So she she actually emailed them and said could you add because she never listens anything at 1.0
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.700]   She's thinking you had a speed up. Yeah, and they dare you
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:20.340]   I was gonna say they have a speed up feature. They just added it. Yes, who they think thank you lisa
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.620]   Thank you lisa because she she won't listen to anything at 1.0. She didn't listen to me at 1.0
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:32.340]   Which when I get home, she says are you drunk you're speaking so slowly. Yeah, can you build that into your hearing aids?
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.340]   You know
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:43.540]   Sometimes sometimes people tell me they listen to my other podcast in fast-beat and all I can say is thank you very much
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.980]   Yeah, you have to talk like this because I think you're drunk forever. Yes
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.780]   This is weird, but it works if you slow any voice down. It sounds like
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.820]   Oh, I'm trying to find it now. I I read an article this week by a guy who
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:08.500]   Had the voice synthesizers for different languages read the english
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:15.700]   Like it was the Dutch voice read the english and it sounded like a Dutch person who learned english
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:21.380]   It really worked it was amazing the it oh if I can I gotta I'll find it. I gotta find it
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.740]   I I guess I didn't bookmark it. I like to I like to find that stuff as play it for you, but I I'll have to look
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.300]   um
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:34.500]   The president former president. I see you wrote this story here is suing
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.380]   Facebook Twitter and youtube
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.340]   Yeah, he sure is claiming his own government violated the constant wait a minute what that's not my car
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.500]   But yeah, um, yeah, this is mike maznik writing on the detector
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.500]   He got a few things wrong. I mean
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:55.940]   And he probably knew it because I don't think he has it he thinks he's gonna win that that lawsuit, but one is a quote-unquote lawsuit right now
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.980]   It's the first might call it a performative lawsuit
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.980]   Exactly
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.540]   It is
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.220]   You know one of the first amendment doesn't apply to private companies if you read it is pretty clear
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.980]   It says congress shall make no law
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.980]   But the other is this notion that these companies are are discriminating
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.340]   Well, first of all the reason I knew about the lawsuit
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.940]   Is that I read about it on twitter and facebook and on cnn and other so-called fake news sources
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.260]   So the fact is that these
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:28.340]   Services have millions of people on them in taw- junior trump jr. Still on twitter
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.780]   um
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.380]   Trump was on twitter until there was an insurrection so it wasn't as if
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:40.740]   They banned him for insulting people and well and and to be fair. This is a class action suit, which he's initiated
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.740]   I don't know if he has anybody else in the class
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:49.540]   But the the he says i'm defending the american people right against censorship by these
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.780]   Companies obviously it'll be thrown out immediately by any judge who says well
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.100]   This isn't a first amendment case because this isn't the government. These are private companies
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:05.220]   The really the thing they're going after is section 230 of the communications decency act because that's the
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.620]   As some say the fundamental law that made the internet possible
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.260]   However, and I make this point in my column
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.060]   Trump's misguided lawsuit against social media companies
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.860]   I know a lot about 230 because i'm in the internet safety business and that was an outgrowth of the communications
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.180]   Defense the act which I opposed because it was ron limes edition because he said
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.460]   Well, we got to have this we got a carve out an exemption
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:32.340]   Here's the thing though if it weren't for 230 trump might have been kicked off social media years ago
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.180]   He would have already been kicked off
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:42.580]   A reason oh protects these companies from having to censor people like donald trump
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:48.420]   Who say things which could for example when trump accused joe scarborough of murder
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:54.580]   Which he basically did scarborough. I mean even though scarborough is a public figure that could have well have been a litigatable
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:58.020]   Accusation he could have gone after twitter
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:02.260]   But he couldn't because of section 230. Yeah, right and if he had gone after twitter
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.220]   You better believe rather than face a multi-million dollar lawsuit
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.500]   They probably would have banned trump at that point so so I think it's probably the point of this suit is not he knows
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.980]   Or I presume any employer that's working for him and knows that it isn't a first amendment problem
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.180]   But is to highlight the problem with section 230
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.660]   Well
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.540]   I'm gonna say i'm gonna be even more cynical. I'm gonna say fundraising is the main goal
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.660]   It's he's sending out fundraising links and and to play into the in some ways
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:37.540]   Justifiable concern that a lot of americans have about big tech and big media and and at the end of my column
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.540]   I do point out that
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:46.420]   As much as I hate to even in any way shape or form give him any ammunition it is true that big tech is
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:52.500]   Even though they are private companies they are the public's forums and and an argument can be made
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.820]   That you know big tech should be regulated. There should be some oversight
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:03.380]   I'm not agreeing with trump's analysis, but I am saying that he's playing into that and this is the problem we have
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.940]   Is that even though twitter facebook
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:13.140]   YouTube or private parties they are the public. They are the they are there are where discussions
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.500]   Happen and so they does seem to me that they have a little bit of a higher responsibility
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.220]   then you know
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.500]   And that's one of the reasons why it took so long for them to kick trump off because they were bending over backwards
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.260]   And by the way, they created new rules for him so that he would not be kicked off
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.460]   And as I point out at the end of my column and I will disclose here my nonprofit gets money from facebook twitter
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.020]   Microsoft google and a lot of these companies so
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:44.020]   And I'm the first one to admit that these companies need to be looked at very carefully
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.780]   But again, they are private companies and from everything I can see
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.420]   They discriminate against bad behavior
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:55.460]   Whether it's from the left the right or the center anybody who goes on facebook and advocates violence or twitter
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.220]   Who?
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:03.140]   Propagate hate speech who harasses people they're going to get kicked off whether they're a liberal or a problem
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.700]   They're not perfect and they do it imperfectly and so because of those mistakes
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:12.340]   People can say well you banned the president, but you didn't ban
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.860]   Khomeini in uh in iran, right so
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:20.420]   Is it that you you know don't like the president, but you like the the
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.780]   regime and what did Khomeini say that I mean do you ban Khomeini because he's a bad guy
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.460]   Or do you did man do ban him if he says something on your platform that violates the term the service
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.020]   Which causes people to invade the capital, you know, right? That that seems like the thing
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:41.380]   Well, I mean, but what's interesting to me like if and I don't disagree with with you that I do feel like
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:48.660]   These platforms even though they're not the public square and they're not public utilities are definitely the way that people do use to communicate
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:54.420]   But if we were to regulate them and treat them like open airwaves or the telephone or other things
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.540]   I mean 230 would no longer even be that wouldn't even be like a debatable thing
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:05.140]   It's like of course you can't hold them responsible. You can't sue at and t right because someone makes death threats over the phone
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:11.220]   Right and at and t cannot prevent people from saying hateful things on the phone when they call people now
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.020]   Can there be a criminal complaint that you put against that person?
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.180]   Yes, but you can't go after the phone company the same thing with other public airwaves
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.580]   Like there there are decency laws and standards
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:28.180]   But a lot of that is really just up to like whatever the f fcc at that particular moment wants to choose to do and even then
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:34.820]   like free speech is is pretty broad as it's been decided so ironically, it's like the argument to me
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.660]   is really
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.460]   Completely incogruous because on the one hand it's saying this is violating my first women rights because this is
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.660]   Um the public square and i've been limited by what I can say
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:51.380]   On the other hand it's saying well, you know 230 needs to go away because I want to be able to sue these companies and it's like okay
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.740]   but if this really was a first women issue then the 230 stuff would be moot because
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:02.660]   Obviously, you know like they would have even less ability to like they wouldn't be
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.220]   reliable for anything that they
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:10.740]   You know any any decision that they made the other I already if you look at fox and news max and oem which are publishers
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.780]   They're not social media right their guests have had things
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:21.940]   About the election lie and other things which are clearly lies and in fact, I think it's one of the uh one of the uh
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.660]   voting machine companies is suing them they've sued
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.860]   Yeah, two-minute dominion is the other one
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.380]   Dominion sued um and they had to issue apologies. Why not?
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:37.300]   That suit worked really well. It was for such a huge amount of money that that everybody right back down and said oh
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:42.580]   I do love all the clips of their anchor saying no no no you cannot say that and here's my prepared statement
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.820]   So so maybe that's the way to go about it is
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.540]   Is that that kind of lawsuit?
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.940]   Defamation live with money slander
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.020]   Twitter
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:25:00.020]   Did a survey which is closed now so I can't show you all the questions, but it was I thought very interesting
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.740]   They they they said we and they stopped us on april 12th
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.700]   We we read some of these questions on this week in google
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.340]   Uh, and I thought it was very challenging
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.300]   Because it's not easy to know what to do and that's really the thing I yeah
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:18.020]   I think comes home to me every time is it's hard. It's easy to say oh you are bad
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.180]   You're wrong. You shouldn't do this. It's very hard to know what to do
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.140]   Thanks to the verge there. I have a screenshot from one of the questions
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:32.340]   Let me just ask you guys and and the people listening put yourself in this consider twitter said the following hypothetical situation
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.180]   You see a tweet
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:40.340]   as described below a tweet is from a representative in the national legislature of another country
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.260]   Okay, not ours
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:47.220]   It contains misleading information about election in a third country in another different country
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:53.460]   The tweet is an official government account and this is their third violation of twitter rules
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.620]   So what should twitter do take no action delete the tweet
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.420]   Not delete the tweet, but apply a label
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:06.180]   Require the account holder delete the tweet remember. It's the third violation should they permanently suspend the account
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:12.100]   Remember, it's an official government account. You know what's embarrassing. I'm on twitter safety advisory board
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:17.620]   And you would think I would know the answer to this right? It's impossible and and I we are they actually
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.660]   At one of our meetings they presented similar things a year ago and about two-thirds of us got it wrong
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.660]   Well, I don't know what is wrong even. I mean, I don't know what the right answer is
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.580]   If you do this always changing and it had many questions
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.860]   You'd see it's very difficult very nuanced
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:40.580]   And the real problem is neither twitter nor facebook nor youtube can write rules that cover all situations
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.980]   so
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.460]   I don't envy them their job. I do think there's a responsibility because they are a public
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.260]   They are effectively our public forums these days
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.180]   No, it is really hard and it's hard for their moderators to get it right even if they have rules
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.220]   And it's even hard for their senior staff who you would think
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:03.620]   Who even make the rules to understand how to interpret them at every every step of the way as you know facebook created it's
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.820]   It's supreme court if some people are calling it
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:14.900]   To arbitrate some of these issues and I think even they are going to have challenges. Yeah. Yeah, I mean that first case is fundamentally useless for them, right?
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.100]   So this by the way, this conversation is where I shout out a
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:25.140]   The show everybody should be watching which is the good fight which the latest episode was about section 230
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.900]   And even had a jolt in song. Uh, yeah going over 230. It was mess. It was a mess
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.820]   Really? It wasn't how all these because yeah, what was the predecessor to the good fight the
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:42.820]   Good wife the good wife. Oh, yeah, often great. I covered technology subjects pretty well. I saw it
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.820]   But this one this this showed us too. I just think this topic was kind of a
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.900]   Yeah, I
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.980]   Well, they're not alone. In fact, you know, tecta mic masonic actually has a page
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.860]   That you can refer to people to when they get section 230 wrong
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:02.980]   Have you seen that page? No, but i'm glad he's oh it's hysterical. Let me see if I can find it because it has
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:08.820]   Uh, it has basically you can link to parts of it
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.740]   Uh depending on what they got wrong
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:18.260]   So it says hello you've been referred here because you're wrong about section 230
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:27.780]   And and then it has sections if you said once a company like that starts moderating content
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.460]   It's no longer a platform but a publisher
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.380]   And then it says I regret to inform you you're wrong and explains why if you said
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.860]   Because of 230 websites have no incentive to moderate you were wrong and explains why
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.860]   Etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, highly recommended
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.380]   Next time you get in a fight over section 230 and maybe we should
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:50.260]   Send this live right this post. Yeah, we should send this to uh the the good uh, what is it? Good fight?
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:54.900]   Good fight. Good fight. Yeah, this saved me a lot of writing because i'm constantly
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.780]   Playing this to people. Yeah, that's I think that's probably why mike did this is because he got really tired
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:06.100]   Of answering all these we've got a great panel. We're gonna talk about the billionaires in space
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.460]   Billionaires in space and more
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:16.660]   With christina warren from microsoft. She's senior cloud advocate, but more importantly just a great person
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.220]   I almost don't want to even say you're from microsoft. You're from you're from christina warrenville
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.980]   I'm from the internet from the internet of the internet fame
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.060]   Devender hard-or-war senior editor at engagit always a pleasure having you
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:34.900]   How's the baby? Yeah, she's good. She's sleeping two and a half now. So she's barely a baby now
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.420]   She is a little one and i'm wow go so fast
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.620]   And uh, I know you know that larry maggot also here connect safely
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.780]   Dot org, but he still helps kids. I do with his sight and seniors too
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.060]   Diaper than both ends
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:55.700]   I'm just waiting. I knew there was a circle up. Yeah, it's a circle
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.860]   Are you
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.780]   Are you sure today by the way larry? I don't know if you've noticed but the air you're breathing is pure
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.860]   it's fresh it's delicious because
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.660]   We use a molecule not because we can open the window
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:16.100]   Unfortunately a lot of offices you can open the window, but you know the EPA says indoor air can be as bad as five times worse
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.660]   Than outdoor air
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:24.660]   And of course outdoor air can be pretty bad too if you live in wildfire area. I have one of those at home
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:29.380]   Yeah, yeah, we got we got no living room and we got it when we were having the that was so smoky
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.780]   So we got one at home and then we got one for the kid then we got one for the studio
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.860]   We actually have a variety of molecules
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.860]   Molecule is not it. It's not it's not exactly a filter
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:47.220]   So I want to kind of explain what this is. There's a there's a pre filter that you change, but there is also a picot
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:52.820]   Device it's a it's kind of like a screen a grid that traps
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.660]   Tiny tiny pollutants in the air
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.220]   Viruses bacteria mold even volatile organic compounds
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:05.460]   And then it doesn't just trap them in storm it destroys them with light
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:12.900]   It's picostans for photo electrochemical oxidation. It actually destroys these pollutants in the air
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:20.020]   picotecnology for molecule meets performance requirements and fda's guidance for use in helping reduce the risk of exposure
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:24.340]   To sars cove to the covet 19 virus in health care settings
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:30.020]   In fact their molecule air pro rx which is used in medical medical offices dental offices
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.660]   Got a 510k class two medical device clearance from the fda
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.820]   For per for devices used to destroy bacteria and virus in the air
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:46.500]   So we've always had molecules around the studio, but we actually went out and we we got the molecule air pro for this giant studio
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.140]   For that very reason because uh that we had to have some people in the studio
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.660]   Yeah, isn't I review? Oh, you have a good review of it. I mean cleaning your air. Yeah
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.300]   Uh, I think this is really an interesting technology. Unfortunately
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.060]   Uh, I don't I think people compare it to a filtration system
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:09.140]   And so I want you to understand picot is completely different. It's really a breakthrough in air purification
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:15.860]   Um dirty indoor air can contain all sorts of junk dust and pollen pet dandruff allergens
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:23.460]   Pollutans like, you know paint fumes you're you're off gassing from your carpets and your drapes put formaldehyde in the air
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.060]   There's of course viruses and bacteria. There's mold
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:32.020]   And the problem with other air filtration systems is they just trap them
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.140]   Molecular purifiers destroy them
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.540]   And it's pretty darn satisfying you can get the little one the molecule air mini
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:44.100]   That's for rooms up to 250 square feet perfect for a bedroom the molecule air for
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.260]   Larger areas up to 600 square feet the molecule air pro
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.860]   That's what we have here in the studio for rooms up to a thousand square feet
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:56.340]   They have the new air mini plus that has a particle sensor and on a protect mode
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.540]   Which is just the fan speed based in the sensor and as I mentioned
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:06.740]   The molecule air pro rx which is fda cleared to destroy bacteria and viruses in the air
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:12.020]   I gave it the ultimate cum. I said it looks as if it could have come from apple. Yeah, it is the apple of air purifiers
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.140]   It's it's aluminum. It's polished. It's very pretty
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:20.820]   Uh, but it's also and I really want to urge you if you're interested to go to the molecule website
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:29.300]   M-o-l-e-k-u-l-e dot com and read the scientific papers because they have gone to d o e labs
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.340]   Uh, the one I thought was really interesting was from the uh, berkeley labs here for a limited time
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:38.740]   Save up to 120 dollars on the molecule air purifiers by visiting molecule dot com

[00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:01.060]   In here mo le k u le dot com so billion air
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:08.420]   Space you get up early this morning watch it. Uh, I missed it because it was pretty quick quick. Yeah
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:13.860]   Uh, I thought oh I have plenty of time and and it was over but I didn't see the president
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.140]   It's kind of just like touch space. You know, just just a little touch. Yeah
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:21.300]   Yeah, they have they have been exactly cost off the surly bonds of earth
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:26.820]   They just kind of you know brushed them aside briefly. Uh, I don't want to make fun of it. Richard branson
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.300]   Virgin galactic
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.900]   Uh, he and uh, I think it was five people went up
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.380]   But it's 50 miles, right?
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:40.100]   80 and 56 and I don't quite understand the difference between those two numbers
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.940]   But according to jeff basil, it's their important distinction. Did you see the tweet?
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:50.580]   I thought this was actually kind of me. Yeah, yeah, meow. So here's what here's
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:58.420]   This is like desperate housewives of bell air or something. I don't know so
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:04.740]   Jeff Bezos who owns blue origin a space there's space x which is elon musk company
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:09.540]   There's jeff basil says blue origin and then it's virgin galactic, which is which are branson of virgin
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.340]   So jeff basil said i'm gonna we're gonna take
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:16.820]   They call it the new shepherd because it's similar to allen shepherd and gus grissoms
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.820]   Suborbital flights the earliest days of the us space program
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:25.300]   We're gonna take they call it the new shepherd where take jeff said i'm gonna take my brother
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:30.740]   I'm gonna take this wonderful woman walley funk who's in her 80s. She'll be the oldest person ever to go into space
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.900]   uh, she was
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:38.980]   an faa flight uh inspector. She was a pilot with thousands of hours and 19 000 hours in the air
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.700]   also
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.140]   trained
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.980]   By a private company. I found out it's not by nasa but trained for mercury
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.900]   But nasa wouldn't let him fly elbj wouldn't let him fly when he was vice president
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.060]   He says how do we stop this because they didn't want women in space
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:36:00.260]   Um, so she never got to go in space. She will finally go up with jeff and his brother
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:05.460]   And then some unnamed millionaires paid 28 million dollars. Is that you christina? Are you going?
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.380]   Yeah, sure
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.540]   They'll go uh, they'll go up
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.700]   A little higher
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:20.260]   On july 20th, which is nice. That's the and a 52nd anniversary of the landing on the moon apollo 11's landing on the moon
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.140]   Um, and then richard branson says well, i'm gonna do it
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.860]   on july 11th nine days earlier
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.900]   And uh, but on friday
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:36.100]   Bezos well blue origin, but i suspect jeff he probably wrote all that text. Yeah, i'm sure he did
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.740]   tweets
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:45.540]   Oh my god like well, they're not really going into space. We're going into space
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.460]   compare
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.180]   Okay from the beginning. This is july 9th
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:55.860]   New shepherd was designed to fly above the carmen line. So none of our astronauts have an asterisk
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:00.820]   Next to their name space begins at 100 kilometers up. That's the carmen line
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:07.780]   So they posted a comparison chart. I almost don't even want to show you this so it's so offensive
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:13.620]   They said well blue origin flies above the carmen line virgin galactic does not oh my god
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:18.180]   We have a rocket they have a high altitude airplane. Yeah, we have even rocket bro
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:24.660]   You even rocket. This is the funniest one. They we have the largest windows in space. Yes. I was gonna say
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:31.620]   They merely have airplane sized windows actually this one I do care about we have an escape system
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.820]   They do not you're gonna escape the space arguably
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.460]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was gonna say what good is that gonna do you at 100 kilometers?
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.700]   Really
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.700]   arguably
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.980]   You know that means virgin galactic braver, but okay
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:53.380]   Then they talk about ozone layer impact and the history of flights. It's just tacky
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:58.420]   Uh, I know now when I when I buy my ticket, I'm gonna have to buy it on uh jeff bathe
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:06.340]   Those can I get it on my amazon credit card? Well, actually that's that's what's interesting about the whole thing is this really isn't about space exploration
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.660]   This is about space tourism, right
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:16.980]   Uh virgin galactic plans to charge 250 thousand dollars for these flights sometime. I know blue origin wants to do something similar
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.060]   Um
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.620]   It's not a historic, but it is civilians. Yeah, civilian space
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.420]   No help from the federal government known help from nasa
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.460]   Do you even rocket bro?
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.900]   That's the best line you have a high altitude airplane
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.900]   I think you've been rocket bro might be the episode
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:44.580]   Do I really care what the propulsion system is it gets me there? No, in fact arguably it's cooler that they've got wings
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:49.140]   Yeah, I don't know the shuttle had wings too. I you know, I don't but you know
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.540]   I'm sure you're gonna talk about the other billionaire in this race
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.700]   We're not in three because he's in a team completely different
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.940]   I mean michyland. Well, here's an example
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.540]   No, no one ever said he'll on musk is the class. He's guy in the world
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:06.340]   But he took the trouble to go to truth or consequences in new mexico and watched the launch this morning
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.980]   He was there to shake richard branson's hand. Yeah, and there were no snarky tweets
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:18.020]   Um, so here's another difference that musk has talked about interplanetary travel. He's not talking about the edgy
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:21.380]   Yeah, he wants to go to mary. He's got a much more ambitious program
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.380]   well, yeah, send him there actually
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:31.540]   SpaceX has also talked about using their launch system to do say new york to shanghon in an hour
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:39.060]   And when you look at these flights bring it they're going up and down, but you could go up and over right and uh
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.460]   Now
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.580]   Elon says he's gonna try to do this at roughly the cost of a first-class ticket in New York to shanghon
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:52.500]   Amazing depends on how fancy that first-class flight is that could be 10 20 thousand dollars, but still
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.300]   To do it in an hour
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   10,000 would be pretty great. Yeah
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.860]   Totally, you know, I might even save my pennies just to say I you know
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:06.100]   I get my my space wings my time isn't worth that much but the experience
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.460]   Oh, absolutely. Yeah for a lot of businesses
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:14.340]   Who are already paying that for I mean assuming it's round shrimp and it's not 10,000 each way
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.740]   uh, yeah at the time alone because I've been on I've been on
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:26.340]   16 17 hour flights like non-stop. I've been Atlanta to shanghonnesburg. I've been um Seattle to Dubai
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.740]   Um, I've been Los Angeles to guitar. Um, I've uh been
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.260]   guitar and then guitar to um, bye
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.220]   um, I've been on a lot of really really long flights and those are hard and they
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.500]   And they cost a lot of money. Yeah, and um
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.620]   I've been from Los Angeles to Sydney another 16 hour flight. So like
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:54.900]   I definitely if it was one of those things where I traveled like I used to it for the money that the company paid for me to travel
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.540]   If you could do that in an hour. Yeah
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.500]   What did ticket on the uh
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.540]   What did tickets on the Concord cost because I remember legends of the day were a lot. They were a lot. Yeah, I don't know
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.980]   Yeah, I can't remember the exact amount, but it was it was higher than a first-class
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.740]   It was definitely higher than a first-class. And that was what three hours. Yeah, three hours in New York to London. I think yeah
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:19.780]   Yeah, so bus can cake you underground through his boring company or above ground
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.260]   You can get it get to either way, right?
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:27.140]   Or if you want to have tesla take you on the on the surface billionaires are just a different breed
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.820]   I mean Bezos has a half billion dollar yacht, right?
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:36.820]   Uh, yeah within the yacht, right? These guys are in the vertical becoming trillionaires. Yeah, beyond the owners. Yeah, uh
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:43.540]   Uh, I note that Branson did not uh take off his seat belt to float around uh like the others did he was
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:47.700]   He's 70 man. Like I don't I would not trust any of that. Yeah
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:55.060]   Yeah, it's you know what this is staying safe. It's being cool. It's not historic. No, yeah
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:59.380]   Not from a technical standpoint. It's cool. I mean Elon could you know, this is where I give you lines of credit
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:03.700]   He could say watch me bro and and knock on the door of the space shuttle, right?
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:10.180]   And come back but uh he's not into his credit and yet these guys are taking their life in their hands
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.100]   Uh
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.620]   For brag
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:17.540]   What I mean for Branson that makes sense, right? I mean like it's market his whole thing
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.980]   Well, yeah, but also his whole thing
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.780]   I mean, you know was was uh was doing like the the sailing races right all that stuff like it's true
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:29.860]   He's an adventure. Yeah, he's more than an adventure like like his whole thing like he and Ted Turner used to you know like
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.220]   battle over what what's the what's the um
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:39.220]   The america's cup. Yeah, the america's cup exactly and so you know and he's he's done a lot of that sort of stuff
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:45.300]   uh, he's he's dabbled in some of the you know high speed like uh, you know normal flight stuff too, so
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.060]   Um
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.140]   This I think is just like fits with his whole ethos of what he's been like his whole career
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.580]   Where with bezos, it really does seem to be like a tit for tat thing like
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:59.460]   Let me bring out the amazon a ws comparison chart like dude like can you just not?
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:04.340]   That was really weird and this isn't taking anything away from what you're going to do in 10 days
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:09.460]   It's really not would you if I gave you 250 thousand dollars. Would you do this?
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:16.260]   Oh, yeah, yeah, would you yeah at my age, you know, I I'd have to get in shape
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:21.220]   That's that's the heart the heart do you I think you do things are yeah, that's gonna be rough
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.300]   Yeah, I think I'm pretty good shape because of the the
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:28.020]   I mean, I used to be a pilot and I did not enjoy the arabatic face to have to do
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.340]   I don't enjoy me there and so I don't know if I would I don't know if I'd have fun doing it
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:36.100]   But I would do it for the experience. Yeah, I'd suck it up. Would you do it? Would you do it to vendor?
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.380]   I mean, I would I would do it. It's certainly a thing like hey
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.260]   We've all dreamed of going to space and I feels like it's cool that
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.100]   We're kind of one step closer
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:49.860]   Yeah, but watching this whole like billionaire slap fight really just reminds me of uh like the vision of space
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:54.100]   We got in uh the great film at astra that last brad pit one
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.500]   um where they get to the moon
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.300]   And uh, there's napple bees on the moon
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:04.580]   There's uh, you know, there's just like all the strip mall garbage you expected america
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.780]   Right there on the moon. That's where we're headed. Yeah, you're right
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.300]   Can I be honest with you as much as I part of me hate stuff
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.100]   There's in the part of me that like the kitsch part of me that kind of yeah
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.860]   Like I kind of love it if i'm honest like the first thing we'll do for sure
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.300]   It's straight out of the moon. I'm like not mad
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:25.780]   Like okay, yeah, it feels like you're in a barnall shorts and agar bovie or something. It's like
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.940]   Very total recall total recall
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:31.300]   Is a lot of money, but there's a lot of people in this country that could afford that
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:37.140]   Yeah for a once in a lifetime experience. I mean if you know I I turned down the blue angels twice
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.460]   Ooh
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:40.980]   That's fun though free free free free
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.860]   Well
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.260]   For the same reason you don't like doing the acrobatics
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:51.060]   And I feel like the reason I didn't want to do it is because I know these pilots are going to try to make me throw up and pass out
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:51.940]   Right
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.300]   So
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:59.140]   Sounds like I'm like agreeing to torture on the other hand this even though it would probably be scarier
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.580]   Yeah
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:05.620]   You're in space you're going up into space ish you're on the edge of space. That's pretty cool
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:10.340]   So what what I would need from this I think I mean I would do it period like if somebody we did float around
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:15.620]   I'm sorry. Okay. He did float around. Okay. Okay. Okay. I would do this period if somebody wanted to front me the money
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.940]   But if this were something where like let's pretend let's pretend that I had to pay my own money and let's pretend that
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:26.020]   I wanted to drain my 401k and my stock options. Oh, no, no, no, don't do this. No, I'm not going to but I'm saying
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:29.700]   The only thing that would like make it any way like conceivable
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:34.900]   Whatever would be if they made it a really luxury experience, which is not what it is right now, right?
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.020]   Like you know what the concord was an luxury experience
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:41.620]   People I know have been on the concords is actually very uncomfortable
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:46.180]   No, it wasn't yeah, that I heard it right whereas whereas like if I was like the eddy at apartment or um
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.820]   I did the singapore sweets. Um, when I did you really
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:54.180]   Yeah, I use credit card points. It was the most amazing experience. It's like did you have a shower?
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.740]   Um, that one didn't have a shower, but I had a full like enclosed room
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.780]   They brought me like caviar to start and like expensive. She don't want to wait
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.300]   They they they no my flight was my flight was only seven hours
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.260]   I was I've never been satter in my life. I know had a seven hour flight
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.260]   But it was it was the most
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.660]   Awesome experience and it was worth like the hundreds of thousands of credit card points
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:21.380]   I used and I would you know, again, I did it because I was like, I don't know if I'll have the opportunity to do it again
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.380]   But like that was the sort of thing was like okay
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:28.980]   In the future if they bring this level of service back which is remains to be seen like I could see
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:33.060]   Shelling out this much money for a really long international flight
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:38.100]   It's kind of a shame to do it on a on a seven hour flight. I know it was it was
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:44.660]   If I could have done it for a 15 is fine much better you want to spend some time in that private bed
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:49.700]   One way to look at a $250,000 space flight. It's just two Tesla s-plades. I mean, it's not
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:58.340]   Where's the Tesla that's floating around eventually somebody could just like yeah, they hide about yeah, he launched a
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.220]   the original sports sports car
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:06.420]   That's right the the roadster the roadster that's no one wants
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:10.180]   You know as we're talking about all this guys like I just wonder
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.980]   I do think as a society we do have to take a step back in terms of how we think about your travel
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:18.660]   Yeah, now now we have consumer rockets coming, but
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:23.540]   We don't know what this environment's gonna look like in by 2030 by 2040
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:30.260]   You know we kind of have to stop traveling as much by air and start doing something about this impending doom we're all facing
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.700]   So that's kind of what's on my mind right now too right?
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.580]   It's interesting. I watched summer of soul this weekend, which is about this yep amazing concert in Harlem
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.820]   And they it happened to happen the day that the moon landing took place
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.460]   They were having this concert and they interviewed people in the crowd
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.380]   Of course, this was all mostly African-Americans
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.900]   And while most people said it was cool and they loved the fact that was happening
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:56.020]   A lot of people said we could be using this money in our community here on earth to make things better
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.540]   And I think that that's the debate we really have to continually have
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:07.380]   And you're absolutely right about the environmental impact. I mean air travel and and the faster the air travel the more inefficient it is at least at this point
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.260]   We really have to question
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:14.500]   You know, is it is the environmental impact of this kind of transport worth
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:19.620]   You know the amount of time we know what is the balance to to human kind? Yeah
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.820]   On the other hand
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:30.260]   At some point it's too late. So let's fiddle wall room. Oh, we're doomed. I mean Leo. Okay, you can you can say that but yeah
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.260]   I'm older than you are
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:41.140]   Thinking of his of his child. No, yeah, exactly. I feel like in the next generation. Yeah, in fact
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.580]   I feel terrible for my kids. I told my 29-year-old daughter don't have kids because
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:53.380]   It's not gonna. Well, if you're kid, it'll probably move to Mars. It'll be fine. So I don't who wants to go to who wants to live on Mars
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:49:00.500]   You know the idea of doing environmental stuff like doing science. Oh, Mars fine. Mars living on Mars is the dumbest idea in the world
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.180]   Mars is a great place to raise your kids. I hear it's cool in this hell
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:10.260]   Yeah, so it's not that great. No, not much. It was it was Daniel Suarez told me that the
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:14.340]   The dust on Mars is so fine and
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.980]   Its composition is it's highly toxic
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:23.220]   If you if you got even a little bit of that you die. Oh great space wants to kill you space wants to kill you
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.820]   No, we should fix this planet. I agree a hundred percent. Yeah
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:31.220]   I'm starting to think
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.380]   The prognosis is not great. Yeah
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.380]   You I don't like it. It's not great to go to Mars. Well, I know we're not going to Mars
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:44.100]   But I wonder and I think we're old enough that we're probably not going to see the worst of climate change probably Christina and Devinda
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:49.300]   Maybe you'll see a little bit of your kids. I'm gonna see it. Mm-hmm. Are gonna be growing up in
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:56.340]   2080 2090 when it's gonna be a hellscape. Not so good. They'll be my age in 2080 or 2090
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:03.140]   And I don't see us doing nobody's doing anything about it. We're not doing anything
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:07.780]   Like none the the Paris agreement like nothing is actually happening
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:13.220]   I don't know. Maybe I'm a little cynical right now because I'm also reading Kim Stanley Robinson's the Ministry of the Future
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.460]   Which is an incredible book. I love him as an author
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.860]   But it's so bleak and you can also tell like man
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:22.180]   He is just angry because he's been writing about this stuff forever and nobody's doing anything
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:28.980]   And we're just like going straight into the sun basically one point. I got so worried about climate change. I went out and got a couple of books
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.580]   One was called the sixth extinction. Yes, that was so depressing
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:39.700]   And then I got another one. I can't remember the name of it and by the end of those books
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:43.540]   I just I didn't help
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:49.300]   I was it was despair David Pogue as a new back had had a survive climate change a little more about it
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.380]   Yeah, a little more upbeat
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.900]   But uh, you know, there's only how high can you build a seawall?
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:51:00.260]   You know, I was really hoping that covid would be the wake-up call for climate change that it sure felt like we were
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.380]   Time to listen to air was cleaner the animals. Well, no, yeah
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:07.540]   But I'm talking about the fact that scientists told us that bad things would happen
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.100]   Uh-huh bad things happened
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:16.980]   And and people are like, yes, right, please more and people and people are like we want to blame everybody but this
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.540]   Uh, it's not the scientist
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.820]   Dr. Fauci turned it into public enemy number one
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:27.940]   Or even worse, you know, it goes into nihilism. Oh, no, no bad things didn't happen, you know
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:34.580]   Million if you can't even get people to wear a mask, right? How are you gonna get them to stop driving their car?
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:39.460]   Right or even or pick a more environmentally friendly car. No, no, no, no, by the way
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.500]   It's too late to pick up you and I drive electric vehicles
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:50.740]   No too late. We shouldn't even have personal ownership of vehicles at this point. Sure because those things are made out of earth
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:55.780]   Yeah, thank you, christina. Oh, there you are. Thank you christina. You're doing your part
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:02.260]   I miss not owning a car. We're doing a lot of stuff like we're doing a lot of stuff like oh, I'll drive a more
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.740]   eco-friendly car
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:09.860]   You and I did something even worse. We need to do dramatic things. We did something really bad. We actually
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:16.740]   Traded in our cars when we didn't have to that's right and the most efficient car you can own is when you already own yeah
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:23.460]   Right. Well, I'm actually a gas vehicle. I gave mine to my wife. I don't think I gave my wife my Prius
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.100]   We could stop burning. There was a there was a good
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.900]   Podcast is it one of the climate podcasts?
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:35.940]   But they did kind of the the math if you just use an older or buy a used gas car or buy a new even a used EV
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.820]   Yeah, it's still like a net positive to like to go ev
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.220]   Yeah, even if you're yeah, just dumping your old car, but it's this much
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:47.220]   It's this much when we need to do what's your power source? You know this much?
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.300]   Well, yeah
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.620]   I don't feel I just don't see the nations of the I mean I don't I shouldn't be putting this out there
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.860]   I should keep this to myself, but
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:57.780]   I don't see the nations of the world for your
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:04.740]   Any podcast yeah, yeah, nobody's gonna sit up in any country of the world, especially the us and say yeah
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:10.020]   Let the Chinese go ahead and pollute. We're gonna stop right now. It's not gonna happen
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.700]   It's just not gonna happen. So whatever they're talking about
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:17.620]   with one or two or three degrees Celsius increase in temperature
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.420]   Is gonna happen in 28 or 2090
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:26.820]   Sorry kids. Good luck much sooner. That's why I'm buying beach for property in in Las Vegas
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:32.580]   I'm sorry. I just I just brought the room down. Let me play. I had to bring it up
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:37.220]   But it's also like I can't go. Yay rockets. Yay space travel. Well, that's exactly right
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:42.820]   They're drowning down here. Yeah, you know the billionaires will be in space. Yeah, so good for them
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:47.140]   But I'm glad you gave your wife a Prius. Yeah, my old my old. Thanks for saving the world
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.140]   Uh
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:54.580]   I did find by the way, so this is a programmer who was playing away around with the web speech API
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.660]   This is from mozilla
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.660]   and he took various
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:05.940]   Foreign language voices and played English text through him. This is English text spoken by a Dutch
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.900]   voice
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:10.340]   Nevermind
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.540]   Oh, I'm disappointed. It's worth it's worth looking at
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:23.140]   What's funny is all of the stereotypes you have about how Italians and French people in Germans and Japanese people and and hindy people speak
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:27.220]   Sounds exactly like apu in the simpsons
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:30.020]   Now is it offensive when an AI?
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:35.460]   Designed to speak hindy sounds like apu from the simpsons. It depends on why it's doing it
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:39.700]   That that's the main thing. It's not doing it for any reason. It's a huge computer, right?
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:45.700]   Anyway, I remember the original the early early synthesized voices all sounded like a Swedish trying to
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:50.260]   Shafts yeah, not even here. Do you know?
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.900]   All right
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:57.860]   Firefox does not love me. You're right. The chairman says why never I can never I don't know what it is
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.220]   It's probably I'm on Linux. That's why let's take a little break
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:05.220]   Let's go to the terminal and fix that. No, no, let's take a little break
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:08.980]   And we'll be back with more with the vindra harder war
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:15.540]   It's great to have you divindra senior editor and gadget larry maggud from connect safely.org
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:18.420]   And of course the wonderful Christina Warren film girl
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:23.700]   from microsoft our show today brought to you by express vpn
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:29.300]   I've I like doing these ads because I could talk about all the different reasons you might want a virtual
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:33.380]   private network security privacy, but
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.020]   Let's not forget
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:42.340]   That we've been watching a lot of tv in less 12 13 months. Maybe you've seen all the good stuff on netflix
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:48.900]   Netflix has different content available to you depending on where you're located, right?
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:54.500]   There are thousands of shows that you can't watch because you're in the us say
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:00.100]   Perhaps you're a fan of anime wouldn't it be cool if you could fire up express vpn
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.380]   and
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:07.060]   Go to japan and watch a lot of anime or go to the uk and watch some dr
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.100]   Who?
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.260]   Watching this is their line, but I love it watching netflix without using express vpn
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:16.500]   Is like paying for a gym membership, but only being able to use the treadmill
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:24.340]   Think about it express vpn is the best vpn no logging absolute privacy
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.700]   Absolutely secure and they have locations
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:36.260]   100 different server locations all over the world so you can change your online location and control where netflix thinks you are
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:41.380]   And I asked netflix because before they before I did this I said come on can I do this as netflix
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:43.140]   They said well, we don't tell you you can do it because
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:48.340]   It's completely legal, but we don't tell you because we feel like you're not going to get an experience because you'll be on a vpn
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:54.100]   Well, they didn't know about I guess about express vpn where you can watch hd content. No problem express vpn is so fast
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:58.260]   I leave it on all the time effect you could put it on your route or protect your whole house
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:00.820]   And no one will know it's that fast
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:06.500]   By the way, I got my copy of it because of erder one so I was in turkey and for work
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:10.020]   I needed to access youtube and he was banning youtube at the time
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:13.060]   And it was the only way I could get around there and you were able to use it
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.540]   I was able to get through awesome and I used it in china
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.580]   Just to for actually there's a there's a
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:23.860]   One of the ways I know express vpn isn't law and by the way they do independent third party audits
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:28.580]   I also know because there was a murder case in turkey where the authorities in turkey
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:32.980]   They don't have to do a warrant just went and seized the servers without telling anybody
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:37.060]   And there was nothing on the express vpn servers. They got no
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:42.900]   Information at all good. So if you want to watch top gear on uk netflix, you go right ahead
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:46.980]   Jurassic world on hong kong netflix do it pulp fiction on
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:52.340]   Canadian netflix, it's yours works with other streaming services too as you say with youtube
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.060]   All you have to do is open the app select location
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:59.780]   It's one button connect express vpn runs everywhere not just on your computer
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:04.580]   But on your ios or android device it also runs on your on many routers
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:08.100]   Refresh the page access the geo restricted show you want to watch
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:10.260]   It's great
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:15.620]   I've been using it for a long time now because it's fast you can stream an hd with no buffering

[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:51.940]   Dot com slash twit. We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:57.780]   Okay, we talked about space we caught talked about social networks
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.820]   We didn't talk about the florida law
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:03.700]   Where if you're not disney
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.020]   You can't ban a public figure
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:10.820]   But we don't have to because the day before that law went on effect the judge said what are you kidding me?
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:14.820]   Florida man get out of here
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:21.140]   Uh other governmental action ftc is going to uh says yep, you know, we're gonna
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:28.100]   We maybe we were a little lax a little lenient with the instagram facebook and the uh, what's that facebook?
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:35.060]   So this amazon mgm purchase we're gonna investigate. Oh, yeah, the problem is it takes so long
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:44.340]   It actually it actually may put the kibosh on the whole thing amazon wanted to buy mgm for 8.5 billion
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:47.620]   good article in the uh information saying
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.260]   in a way it is
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:53.220]   absolutely competitive if you think about
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.180]   amazon's competing with
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.220]   television networks
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.380]   other streaming services
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.940]   This is this is a good thing and
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.580]   Sand to say it's not gonna happen probably because it's just gonna take so long for this
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.980]   Amazon we're strictly in the
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.620]   business of selling things like it used to be
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:18.420]   It wouldn't have been an issue because the ftc traditionally allows companies to buy
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:24.100]   Other companies in different industries, but the fact that they are already a major studio
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.780]   And it seems to me that's gonna be part of the argument right now. Yeah, yeah
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.820]   um
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.620]   You know, I think the issue at this point is
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:40.020]   Really that the movie studios are pulling content from places like amazon prime so they can launch
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.020]   You know p-cock
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:47.460]   Things and so this is a defensive move from amazon against any competitive moves
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:54.100]   From the content creators and definitely and also from letting that content go to other people, you know, like that's all it is
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:59.780]   That's all it is. I mean stick with mgm does it is not making hot new films by the way
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.940]   No
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:07.220]   Yeah, they're buying a catalog they aren't making anything theatrically. I don't even think they've had they haven't had any hit theatrical
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.860]   James Bond and other that's what they're buying
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:17.460]   Yeah, because and because the good catalog the historical imgm catalog went to Warner Brothers when tener bought mgm in the 80s
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.340]   So and then Warner Brothers bought
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.380]   Turner in in the 90s
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:28.980]   Uh, but yeah, I mean they're buying the catalog they're buying James Bond and they don't have a James Bond too
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:35.940]   Yeah, I was gonna say they don't get the IP they get the past catalog and they get the movies, but they can't make new movies
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.660]   And no not necessarily
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:43.780]   Yeah, they have to use broccoli's okay and in the last James Bond film, you know, was distributed by universal
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:48.100]   To my mother used to say what I said is it time for dessert? She said not without the broccoli
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:54.980]   Yeah, but but it's interesting because we've seen this happen before and it'll be interesting to see how this kind of waves out because
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.420]   When these media companies started buying television networks when they were allowed to do that starting with
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.900]   You know the cbs and then a busy by an ABC and whatnot
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:09.620]   We started to see like this kind of a conglomeration where you know
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:17.620]   20th century fox would only make tv shows that they would have first rights access for for the fox television network and universal would have first rights at
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.700]   NBC once they became a thing and ABC stuff for for
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.860]   Disney and whatnot, but what happened was is they would still sell
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:30.420]   You know those shows to other networks, um, you know, wb
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:37.060]   One of others they've had two networks over the past two decades neither have been like successful so to speak
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:43.380]   You know it's the ww wb, but one of others television is behind some of the biggest tv shows in history
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.820]   you know the big bang theory friends um er and
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:54.260]   They didn't even consider they wouldn't even consider okay. Would we take friends from nbc and put it on our fledgling wb service?
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:58.100]   No, of course not right it's like the same reason that they they wouldn't you know
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.660]   Like put big bang theory on the cw
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.900]   Even though that launched the same year, um that that uh big bang went to
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.740]   CBS
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:13.300]   They they sell these things in other places because it makes sense to get the audience that way and we've seen some of this where you've seen
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.980]   some of the you know like uh, you know, uh, ted lasso is is a
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:23.220]   uh, one of others, um and then I think like an nbc co-production, um that's that's on apple
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.580]   Um, obviously it would have been better to be on pecock, right?
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:30.500]   Like that would have made more sense, but they they put it on apple before pecock launched
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:34.420]   And you might say yeah, but remember that office got pulled off of the office got
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:39.540]   Well, yes, well, of course well of course, but they had to pay for that like that's the thing
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:45.220]   Pecock had to pay a huge amount of money to that side of universal to be able to yeah
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:51.540]   But it's all I don't get that because so it's just it's accounting because it is but it's all the same company
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.300]   Yeah, but it's not because they have different p&l stuff for each different
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:57.780]   So it is all it is all like it is all accounting
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:01.460]   But if you think about it, they're running them like different divisions. So yeah corporate wise
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:06.020]   It's big but my point was gonna be but i'm wondering if the ceo of whatever this
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:09.860]   Super company is is just moving chess pieces around
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:17.380]   Sometimes but the other thing my point is like I wonder how long it's gonna be before they just kind of have to accept a reality and go
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:21.300]   Okay, no, we're gonna have to sell our shows to netflix or to amazon
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:25.620]   Because that's where the eyeballs are and if we want this to be a hit and actually get
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.420]   Point or get advertising
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:33.460]   Peacock is not driven a lot of business, but the other option is as a consumer
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:39.220]   And if we have this balkanization of streaming services and we have to pay we have to buy all of them agreed
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.300]   Our old cable bill is it gonna look like pnex compared to what it already does
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:49.780]   Well, no, well already does well look the i've been predicting this for for close to a decade that cable is just going to be repackaged through streaming
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:55.940]   And and the and it is it's exactly what's happened and we only we want a disaggregation we got re we got aggregation
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:01.380]   And that's always that happens. Yeah, no you aggravation and it's harder to find things
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:06.420]   We want an all our cart and instead we're getting once we're never never gonna get all our car funding
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:10.260]   Yeah, we're never gonna get all our car. We're never gonna get all our car even even true all our car
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:17.780]   It's not that great too, right like yeah, it's not I don't want to be paying iTunes, you know for a specific show
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.300]   You know, I've tried that much faster. It's very annoying. Yeah, it's not great
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:27.220]   It's not great people think they want it. They don't what happens is that when when you truly have all a cart
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:32.740]   There are the great shows that don't have a wide enough audience that they can get that money for the don't exist
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:37.220]   So when you have all a cart what happens is it's just like what happens to the box office and traditional movies right now
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:41.220]   Everything is Marvel. Isn't that the isn't that the bigger question though?
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:46.020]   Is the ultimate damage to content in general
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:49.140]   that
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:53.060]   You know, it costs a lot of money to make good tv in movies, right?
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:57.220]   If you balkanize it, you're slicing the pie thinner and thinner and thinner
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:01.220]   Pretty soon. Are you not gonna have great movies? Are you still gonna have
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:06.420]   The high quality I mean where where where is the premier content gonna show up?
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:15.380]   It's a what tv yeah tv movies. It's uh, we're we're this has been a crazy notice how crappy the movies have been this year
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:22.340]   Right, there's no I don't think there's been a decent maybe maybe there've been some maybe a new uh black widow's good
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:27.460]   But but they're having fun fast nine is fast nine is saving cinema and I always knew
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:32.180]   That says something right there. That's fine. It's fun. If f9 is saving movies
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.420]   We're indeed because that's why we go to movies
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:40.660]   They have fun. Well, this point now. Yeah, that's all we got to say at this point
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:48.100]   Because I think of this huge, you know, shift over the last 15 years these massive blockbusters really over the last 10 years
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.940]   The last 15 I think you could really make the argument
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:55.780]   All what we've done is we've ensured that studio is really either are willing to do tiny tiny films or
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:01.780]   Um these big sure to be global international blockbusters. So you go to lowest common denominator
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:06.740]   It's kind of we were saying before about like the the ai voices thing. It's like you lose everything in the middle
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:13.220]   And so is amazon buying engm? It doesn't matter in other words. What where are the other
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:19.780]   It's not for the it's back catalog mostly. Yeah. Yeah. Also. They've been for sale for two years like yep
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:26.180]   I would argue so it's a little weird that the ftc is suddenly gotten woken up and this is what they chose to
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:30.260]   To pick together. They're gonna do something. Yeah, if I were amazon
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:35.140]   I almost be happy because what might happen is saves them goes on and you longer they will
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.380]   Well, well, well, hey, they they back out
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:43.780]   But then what happens is mgm doesn't have any other prospects and then it becomes one of these scenarios where you wait another 18 months
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.940]   And they have to sell for half
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:51.060]   Back to amazon. Yeah. Who was it was gonna buy yahoo and you're right with microsoft
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.660]   And
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:56.660]   God
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:03.620]   Yeah, exactly. Sheary yang was like no, we don't need to do that. It's like yeah, okay, okay for 21 billion. I think it was a lot of money
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:11.460]   Huge amount of money. Yeah, 42 billion. I thought I think I think i think i think i might have also read this side of relief when they didn't get tick tock
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.620]   uh with
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:17.300]   Yeah, I have no idea. I mean I personally read this side of relief because
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:22.180]   Our cultures are not at all that doesn't match. They don't go together
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.980]   They don't go together
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:34.020]   Okay, we'll stay in this vein and then we'll move on to uh security but uh apple is apparently in early talks again from the information
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.700]   to
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:36.340]   buy
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:38.180]   Sunday games
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.180]   from the nfl
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.620]   Talk about the ball
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.740]   Colonization of content. I was very confusing. I know on thirtan thursday night football. I had to figure out
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.220]   Wait, where is it? It's on amazon
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:54.820]   So i'm gonna have to read subscribe to apple tv plus to watch to watch football on a sunday night
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.820]   Maybe maybe not this is
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:01.860]   These are conversations that went on this week at alan company. Uh, the conference is back on in sun valley
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:08.660]   Are you did you go? You hate your private jet? I had to I had to miss it this year because uh, yeah, we were doing maintenance on the jet but uh
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:09.860]   uh
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:14.340]   So my my question on this would be would they be buying it and then still charging like the
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:23.940]   $50 or whatever as an in-app purchase or would this be as a thing for them to try to get people into you know apple tv plus
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:28.260]   I don't know. That's a good question direct tv
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.700]   According to the information pays one and a half billion
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:39.380]   Dollars a year for the sunday ticket package. Yep one and a half billion. It's just it's not even all the games on a sunday night. Nope
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.460]   Uh, uh
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:48.660]   Wow, the nfl really is a money machine. It's amazing actually during covid. I was really glad that there were football games to watch
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:54.260]   Uh, wouldn't be curious about too would would they get you around the geo restriction? Right like are they gonna force?
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:10:00.580]   It's a local market game still can't watch because I would I would imagine that they that they would right but
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:06.580]   I don't know if you could use like bp ends rather stuff apple tv is going to start charging now and they've cut down their
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.980]   There's their trial period of three months
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:16.180]   Um, I'm gonna I've been getting a 499 a month refund from apple tv for months, but I think that's gonna stop
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.740]   uh soon
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.540]   It's really on the edge of like
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:27.620]   Uh, is it are you gonna is it okay now? Ted lasso season two comes out this next week
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:30.660]   This was great mythic quest is great. They've got a lot of good shows
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:37.780]   His mythic quest great really you want to i really like it. Yeah, okay. Yep. I like the last the the uh
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:45.220]   Instant episode they made the covet episode was great, which was the mythic quest is really good. Really? I thought it was terrible
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:50.900]   Okay, oh, I'm a huge always honey fan. So that's my body. Oh, it's from the always satin philadelphia team
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:54.980]   Yeah, I also I hate that show and I love mythic west so you know for all mankind
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:11:01.540]   Okay, people say it's a like season two apparently is incredible morning show was terrible. You guys
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:04.500]   Oh my god, I was awful
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:10.020]   It's a it is weird how it's a whole streaming service where it's like one or two things that's all they've got going
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:18.020]   Well, which I mean was why they were the original rumored buyer of mgm and it made sense
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:23.700]   Um, it's also why they've been a rumored buyer of sony's back catalog, but sony is decided they didn't want to sell
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:30.820]   Um, but yeah, I I mean look at this point. I get it for free as part of my apple icloud plus whatever subscription
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.620]   Yeah, I buy the whole schlamazal schlamazal
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:39.300]   So awesome. I get it through my through my phone. Thanks to our breaking, you know, net neutrality rules. So
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:42.580]   Exactly
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.580]   It's all great. They are
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:51.300]   Uh, what else is happening to apple tv plus they are getting foundation people are very is that foundation?
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:57.300]   Yeah, yeah, the trailers look good people like foundation, but the trailers look you know, I thought that too
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:03.060]   I thought it looks more like star wars than foundation then somebody said well star wars was inspired by foundation so
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.780]   Elements of it are basically star wars. Yeah, yeah
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.660]   But the problem is people know star wars. They don't
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:14.660]   Except for sci-fi. We'll see I don't uh, I believe david goyer is behind this one and that guy
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:21.700]   I'm always iffy when we're on it Jared, harris as uh harry seldon great casting great casting
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.260]   What did what is this goyer guy? What did he do?
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:28.260]   I mean, he's he's the guy who basically started doing comic book movies
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:31.780]   So like what uh the blade movies which you know hit her miss
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:37.860]   But then there's been like a lot of messy stuff throughout the 2000s with him and yeah, not a fan. Okay, okay
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.820]   Well, that's our streaming tv update
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.300]   Yeah
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:48.660]   Whenever film girl and divinda are on they both are you know very much cover this space
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.060]   slash film and
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:57.060]   She's film girl for crying out loud. So uh, yes username. Yeah. Yeah, um you should
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:03.540]   Rocket doesn't really cover uh content or does it maybe you do we do sometimes we do sometimes like you should do get back
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.540]   Into doing some more of that stuff
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:10.100]   Content about it actually yeah, because it's fun. Yeah, and you're passionate about it
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:13.220]   You could just do a gossip girl show and leave it at that
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:18.580]   Uh, I don't want to talk about it. I'm so angry at the new gossip girl. I don't want to talk about it. Oh, right
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:21.220]   I just started watching that last night
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:25.620]   Larry you're watching the new gossip girl. I just started watching it nothing to be
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:29.940]   Larry Larry. I love that. I love that you watched it. It's great. It's great
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:35.220]   Yeah, I I tweeted something about how like it didn't need to be made and
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.140]   a number of like
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.140]   well respected like
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:45.220]   Like people in tech like liked the tweet and I was like very like both amused and kind of
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:51.460]   Watch everyone watched gossip girl. I used to DM with john lager the old ceo of t mobile right?
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.700]   And I used to be a girl
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.220]   What's he doing now by the way?
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.220]   Do you see this challenge you lately?
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:02.900]   He's just enjoying the
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:08.260]   Tink house. Yeah, he's he's much into life and in his villain like living his bed
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.900]   That's life you go john. He did a great job running team over
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:15.460]   He did he was my favorite ceo. He was so entertaining. He was everybody's favorite ceo
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.540]   Everybody else all the other ceos are
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:23.540]   Too constrained to carefully who else is gonna just deal with some rando about gossip girl like no kidding
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:27.220]   Well in a way, I thought a little bit of john lager
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.020]   Mystique was created manufactured
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:35.060]   But now that I know that he DMed you about guys of girl. I feel like maybe it was authentic
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:39.380]   Maybe that really was like he and like he reached out to me like it wasn't one of those things where like I like
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:44.900]   So then his team ends up like yes, let's talk about gossip girl like he like and you don't think he had like a social media person saying
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:47.940]   Okay. Now here's what we do. Yeah, you're gonna. No, no
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:52.660]   He's flying into christina's dms and he's attuned in my parescope sometimes
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.020]   like
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.300]   It was you know, he was just he's very online nice guy and
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:03.700]   I was always impressed. Yeah, those best events were always weird things where he would be like rock star events and like he would
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:08.020]   Stress down the main things like old old days. Those were the old days
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:10.980]   Is he just buying his time waiting for a startup that he can
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:18.660]   Launch or a rocket or is he gonna he's he's like he's been in business for a while. I think he just wants to rest right
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:25.060]   Yeah, I mean like if I were him like I would just like live in my best life. I'd be like I have more than enough money
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.740]   I can buy the way
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:31.860]   This is why we are not flying rockets into space or building half billion dollar yachts

[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:42.660]   The difference between us and all of these mega guys is they're never satisfied. They never get it
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:46.980]   They're never satisfied ledger got 137 million dollars sevens
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:53.620]   If that's me, you're right. I ain't doing another day's work. I don't believe you
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.020]   You think I'd be doing this in a minute?
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:01.700]   Already could retire if you really wanted. I actually could love you
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:06.900]   Take more vacation and you would maybe have like a more of like a roving like like mobile
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:11.060]   Oh, like I think you'd have like a yacht like with this. Do you want to?
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:18.260]   Exactly. Give me 100 million. Yeah. Yeah, is Joe Rogan gonna keep working or is he I mean give me 100 million
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.260]   I would I would build a
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:24.580]   beautiful 50 million dollar air stream and drive around the country
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:29.380]   Here we go. It'll be super cool or record right from the beach, you know
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:31.300]   Just like the waves that's part of the background noise
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.340]   I could afford to retire if I wanted to and
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:38.660]   It's actually kind of fun. You know working is fun if you don't have to work
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:43.540]   If you had to pick grapes, I would you know, yeah, no, but I this isn't picking grapes. This isn't even working
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:46.260]   Um, don't tell any
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.740]   Don't tell Leo he might stop paying. Oh wait a minute
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:56.260]   It's a little different when you when you own the company, right?
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:00.500]   Speaking of which we're going to talk about cassia in just a second. Oh

[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:15.540]   I love my Casper. I sleep on it every day
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.940]   Casper
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.940]   I woke up on a Casper today. I should check my sleep score. I feel like it was very high
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:24.500]   Casper is
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.460]   the best mattress i've ever had in fact
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:32.900]   I confess foolishly we went out. We got a fancy mattress some years ago
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:37.300]   It's not oh, you know, this thing's costen thousands. It must be really great
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:41.140]   Lisa and I looked at each other about a year later
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:47.140]   So this let's get a Casper. Let's get a good. Let's get a we want a new Casper

[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:03.700]   Uh, and by the way in this video I I admit I'm opening this Casper and by the way, they come in an amazingly compact box
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.820]   You open them up and they they expand
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:11.060]   They they're ready to go that you don't have to air them out or anything they smell fantastic
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:14.900]   But I did realize that after doing this I had opened it in my foyer
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:24.100]   Now what I gotta get the mattress into the bedroom, but it is oh look at that
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:32.500]   The Casper's new cooling collection is even cooler Casper's wave hybrid snow mattress keeps you cool for 12 plus hours

[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:36.500]   Saturday night. Oh, I love Philippe. You're a great guy. Yeah, well, he's great. Yeah, so he um
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:39.380]   He invented the camera phone. Right?
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:44.740]   Which is a wild story. We talked about this on triangulation. He was his wife was having a baby
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:48.820]   And I can't understand this as a geek. Maybe you did this too, Devindra
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:54.820]   I beat you. We tried it. You got a 61 you beat me. Yeah, that's not good. Hey, see he's competitive
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:56.820]   too. See see
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:01.860]   So uh, Philippe says there ought to be some way to send pictures out of this baby
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:06.180]   As it goes out. This is I know this is to handle the anxiety, right?
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:11.860]   But but he goes to his car. He gets some tools get some electronics cobbles together
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:17.940]   A wireless radio for his smartphone takes the first camera phone picture of this baby
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:20.340]   Sophia Sophia
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.780]   22 now
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:29.300]   But Philippe is a brilliant guy. He's Frenchman. He plays a saxophone created borland and the clarinet brilliant brilliant guy
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.060]   He said, you know
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:37.380]   This might be a business. He patented the whole thing and pretty much any camera phone you use is is patented
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.620]   by a Philippe con
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:44.100]   And then later he created a company motion x right is that what it's called? Yeah, that
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:48.580]   Monter's the accelerometers in these phones and that's we're sleep track the sleep now
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:52.900]   He's got full power which the sleep trucker and he's full power. He's got a complete sleep lab in Santa Cruz
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:56.340]   I mean, he's like I mean he also races yachts. Yeah
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:59.540]   I was in the uh, we were in the bay a few years ago
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.340]   And uh, we're on a sailboat, not mine
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:05.940]   A friend's and uh, he says see that that's Philippe
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:10.980]   And and they are they're all the boat is like this the healed way over
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:14.820]   There's a bunch of people wearing foul weather gear
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.900]   Hanging out of the boat. They're 20 feet in the air as the boat is almost on the
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:23.460]   Sales almost touching the ground. They're whizzing along and you can see Philippe in the background
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:26.260]   cracking the width
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:29.460]   He is quite a guy. Well, give him my regards
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.460]   I will and he also has a foundation
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:34.180]   That he and Sonya his wife
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:38.820]   Do and I have to be careful what I say whether this is something i'm allowed to talk about but
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:41.460]   um, let's just say that
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:46.180]   The picture of I don't know if you can bring this up picture of the baby of uh, uh, uh,
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:51.620]   Yeah, this is the first camera phone picture that picture may become an nft
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:57.300]   Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, this was the first cell phone picture ever ever taken
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:02.100]   So you can buy the rights to that picture and the money would go to charity. Oh good for him
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.460]   Yeah
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:08.900]   The first cell phone picture in 1997 of his now 22 year old and she did she's student in New York
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:13.700]   Yeah, doing great. So that was a digression, but a good one. Yeah. Yeah
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:17.220]   Uh, casea a name that will live in infamy
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:22.740]   Software used by it guys managed service providers small guys who
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:30.020]   On we use a managed service provider. That's what Russell is. He's they they contract out to small companies to do it services
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:34.900]   Uh, and they uh, it turns out many of them use a product called casea
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:42.900]   Which be in the nature of the thing. It's a monitoring tool. I think they put it on their client's computers. Well, of course casea got hacked
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:44.980]   and um
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:50.340]   At last count somewhere between 800 and 1500 small businesses have been hit by ransomware
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.740]   Because of this flaw
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:59.060]   And casea's software it is literally quite literally the worst ransomware attack in history
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.620]   The are evil guys
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:08.740]   Who perpetrated this have said give us 70 million dollars will give you a decryption key that will work for all of you
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:12.180]   70 million dollars they may get it who knows
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:17.940]   Uh, in fact president biden actually called poutin this week and said knock it off
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:24.740]   I don't know if he said knock it off exactly maybe he said here's the deal knock it off
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:28.500]   But what knock off the malarkey knock off the malarkey. Here's the deal
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.580]   uh
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:33.300]   Actually, the problem is you know our evil
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.780]   Who knows?
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:41.300]   Probably biden and our and our intelligence services have some idea. Are these guys
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:47.220]   tolerated by the russian government funded by the russian government actually employed by the russian government
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:52.100]   It's hard to say or are they just failing to enforce the law which would or the most against the law
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:54.820]   Yeah, and and I think that's probably the latter
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:58.100]   I think it's probably they're they're a ransomware gang they're crooks
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:02.340]   But they're you know, they're the russian authorities are looking the other way
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:06.260]   Anyway biden kind of said, oh, yeah, we don't we don't know if they're
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:11.140]   You know if you guys are supporting them, but you need to enforce the law. You need to get this to stop
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:19.060]   Uh, I doubt that poutin maybe you can I don't know if they ever hooked up with a little tony in their t and yeah, exactly
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:24.260]   Um, anyway, this is the worst news apparently. This is from bloomberg
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:27.060]   Uh, they've got a number of sources of former
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:31.220]   Casa employees in software engineering and development
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:38.820]   They asked not to be identified for fear of professional retribution said they've been warning casa since 2017
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:42.820]   Yes that they were massive security problems
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:46.260]   This is from the bloomberg story of cloud day
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:49.860]   Is this data sitting on casa of cloud server or that sitting in the client's?
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:57.700]   Local storage. Yeah, I wish I don't know and maybe we I know in our chats. We have it folks who might
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.700]   be using casa. So
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:04.100]   Uh
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:08.020]   Recan, do you know if casa how do is my senses? It's a it's a
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:12.260]   performance monitoring tool that you put on clients so that you can
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:15.460]   Maybe do remote access, but maybe see how they're doing
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.220]   Um
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:19.220]   I don't know if it goes back to a cloud
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:24.900]   Among the most glaring problems of clearing bloomberg software underpinned by outdated code
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:28.980]   The use of weak encryption and passwords and casa as products and servers
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.740]   A failure to adhere to basic cyber security practices
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:36.020]   most importantly regularly patching software
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:42.660]   And a focus on sales at the expense of other priorities. Where have we heard this before? This is very similar to the solar ones
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:46.980]   story a casa spoke person declined to address the accusations
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:53.380]   Saying we will not comment on matters involving personnel or the ongoing criminal investigation
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:58.100]   If a car company was as negligent with its safety features, you know with its brakes and airbags
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:01.220]   As these guys are allegedly with their security
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.940]   They would be in very serious
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:10.100]   Legal trouble at least in terms of litigation. They this there you know, maybe they will be one of the former employees
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.140]   told bloomberg in early 2019 he sent the company
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:20.740]   Uh leaders a 40 page memo deleting secure detailing security concerns and he was fired two weeks later
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:30.020]   Another employee said casa rarely patched its software servers and stored customer passwords in clear text on third party platforms
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:33.620]   Oh lord
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:40.580]   The employee and others said executives were told that casa as virtual system administrator software
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:48.660]   Was so antiquated and riddled with problems. It should be replaced. Of course. That's what revil use our revil used is an revil or revil
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.740]   I guess it's our call it our evil our evil. I like revil
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:56.980]   Um that's they are evil used they are evil are evil
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:00.820]   Uh anyway, yeah, just
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:04.820]   This is not the first time we've heard of you know these companies
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:10.500]   Not taking security seriously and what's sad is the small businesses were affected by this probably
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:14.500]   We're taking security seriously and the msp is probably well, you know
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:19.300]   We were constantly being lectured at by people including ilecture people, you know, make sure you got back
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:24.260]   All this and that but the fact is that we are passengers on the bus
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:29.460]   And if the bus company doesn't fix their tire than you get hurt in a crash
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:35.860]   It's not your fault and and that's the problem right now with so much of these these hacks and security breaches
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:41.060]   They're affecting businesses and individuals who didn't do anything wrong. Yeah, you know, yeah
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:44.340]   It's it's it's bad out there
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:50.420]   And uh these ransomware companies are making I mean 70 million dollars, right?
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:53.140]   They're making so much money
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:57.940]   Um, maybe they can sponsor space probes
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:02.020]   According eventually they will yeah according to
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:08.340]   A crowd sourced ransomware payment company they monitor ransomware payments
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.980]   Uh cribs stamos group
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:13.540]   Uh 30
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:17.700]   So far this year 32 million dollars in ransomware payments so far
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:21.460]   This year most of them to are evil
[01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:24.660]   It's like the old airplane hijacking thing
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:29.140]   Yeah, except now it's just like yeah, yeah, it's ransomware everywhere. It's safer
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:32.180]   I was watching um, you know
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:38.260]   A movie about robin armored vehicles say seems to be a very popular subject for movies, right?
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:39.060]   Yep, yep
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.500]   And i'm looking at him and go
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:44.580]   Does anybody do that in one yes as a matter of fact, yeah
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:47.780]   Is anybody do that anymore?
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:51.060]   Why bother why bother? Yeah, why risk your life?
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:57.220]   When you can make so much more just you know a little ransomware here a little heck in there don't have to leave home
[01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:02.420]   Let's see the cinematic you know it makes a lousy movie. I completely agree with
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:09.380]   Yes, we're not going to see in 10 years. Oh, you know boston's famous for their ransomware gangs. You're not going to see that now
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:14.500]   Actually actually thought actually that'd be some movies that was a good that was I like Jason statham
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.980]   I'm trying to remember Alex. That's a that's a fun movie
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.700]   I wish like half the dialogue was not in that movie
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:22.260]   Yeah, I wish people weren't speaking because the words are bad
[01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:25.540]   So words are bad the premise was good and statham is always great
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:33.300]   No, what you could have though is a movie would be somebody has the ransomware attack and then you know statham or someone goes after them and kills
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:40.180]   Exactly exactly that would be the thing is like okay now i'm going to track you down to whatever, you know island or or
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:43.060]   You know, by the way, I think that was black hat
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:45.620]   Black hat was a ransomware, but it was a hat
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:48.580]   It wasn't a ransomware, but it was a smart the plot of startup
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:54.580]   Because basically startup is a boring show about cryptocurrency except that everybody gets killed
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:32:01.140]   So it keeps it interesting. There's there's gangs. There's murders, but it's about crypto
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:06.260]   Um actually was kind of interesting. I we finally finished it last night. We binged the final
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:10.740]   But if it's bad, why are you watching it Leo? I have to ask this to everybody
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:16.100]   Uh why it was somebody could show you know what's interesting about that show it was bad
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:18.820]   The acting was horrific
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:25.220]   Um except that help weighs in it. So that's pretty good. Uh, I love around problem. I love around problem, but uh
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:31.220]   It it's funny even though it was the terrible acting and scripting
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:37.140]   It somehow you got engaged in it in the sense that you want to know what happened next and so I screaming bare minimum
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:40.580]   Yeah, it's like I watched manifest and the first two seasons are on Netflix
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:43.220]   Is it a good idea?
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:45.620]   I just downloaded it for a trip to Hawaii
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:48.980]   Do not watch the 13th
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.180]   It's kind of like the it's the lost problem, right?
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:57.940]   You set up this whole supernatural premise, but you don't really know what's going on and you can't finish
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:00.420]   It makes no sense even within their crazy
[01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:04.180]   Matrix of so here's a tip if you're gonna do this
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:07.060]   Pot the whole thing out first, right? Yes
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:12.420]   And here are the other things and don't lie about it and don't get canceled before you wrap it up
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.780]   Yeah, because they were watching the third season. We said oh, it's gonna wrap up great
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:19.460]   No, they canceled it. They were planning on wrapping it up in the middle. It got so bad
[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:24.260]   Yeah, that they just will never find out how it ends. Just start up ends in the middle too actually
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:30.180]   Yeah, that happened with the um the worst one for me personally that I still will never get over all these years later
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.260]   It was models ink which was
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:39.220]   Place which was a spin off of Beverly Hills. I was who know and I was like 11 and it was a terrible show, but it was great
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:45.220]   It was totally soapy. It was like, you know, like they brought in um, what's her face from um from Dallas
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.780]   um who
[01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:53.700]   Briefly appeared on more of those places Heather Locklear's mom and that was like the connection and it was a bad show
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:58.340]   But it ended on this cliffhanger where one of the characters carry on
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:01.780]   Moss who later went on to be you know in the Matrix of course was like
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:07.300]   Stuck in some sort of like prostitute hell and a gun went off at a wedding
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:11.780]   And there were like all these other things like up in the air and and and then the show was canceled
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:12.500]   Oh no
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:17.060]   They they air it on they aired on e. This is the hilarious thing. They aired on e
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:19.460]   um briefly and
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:22.020]   For the final episode they had like
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:27.380]   One scene that had clearly been shot like in a weird sound stage or whatever where you just see um linda
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:32.820]   What's her face from Dallas just being like that's it. I'm closing the agency and like nothing is for souls
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:36.020]   Would it be legal for you to write your own sequel and wrap it up?
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:40.660]   Is that violating any of their no that's I think that there's a that would actually be great
[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:44.100]   I think there are already a number of season eight's for Game of Thrones
[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:49.540]   I want to do a sequel to first though. I want to I want to see what happened to there's a book sequel
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:53.220]   To first there's a book sequel. It's terrible. Yeah. Oh, yeah, oh too bad
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:57.940]   Yep, all right, but the original book was bad too. So you should write your own sequel
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:01.940]   What's the show that you watch that you would ask? Why are you watching that?
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:06.500]   Why why am I watching that? It was like your guilty pleasure the show that you
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.140]   You hate yourself for watching
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:14.340]   I don't know it's probably not really hate myself. I'm watching the new godzilla anime series on netflix
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:15.620]   Okay, it's fine
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.620]   But uh, it's just kind of
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:22.340]   The animation is really good and I'm waiting for it to like get interesting, but there's a lot of cool stuff in it
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:26.180]   It's not like a good introduction to anime for people, but it's fun for me. Yeah
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:31.780]   Speaking of bringing things back. We can thank microsoft teams. Oh clippy clippy
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:34.340]   Clippy
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.620]   Listen he came he came too soon. We're talking about like predictive
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:44.180]   Uh, he was he was right now for his time justice for justice for clippy. Yeah. Yeah, these are new team
[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:50.740]   backgrounds they featured not just clippy, but microsoft solitaire and microsoft paint and
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:54.740]   I love this bliss. You can have bliss the very famous
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:36:02.340]   windows xp wallpaper. Oh, it's beautiful. This actually was taken off the road a bit in sonoma county
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:07.300]   Yeah, this is a newer high quality looks better doesn't it? Let me go for a screen. Yeah. Oh
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:16.580]   Pretty definition. Yeah, that's a 40 by 480. Yeah, those clouds are brighter. There's uh, I think if you were in a teams meeting and this was behind you
[01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:22.500]   solitaire, uh, yeah, what about I'm into this
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:25.300]   What about bob? I agree
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:31.700]   We need bob here's okay. So what's hilarious on a on campus? We have a like a library
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:36.180]   And um, they have like an archivist thing and they have a wall of fame
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:41.220]   And of classic products, but there's also like a shelf of shame where they show off like scaled products
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:45.220]   Like the microsoft can is there and one of the things is the never released
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:53.300]   The never released bob 2.0. Okay, but the gold master and it never came out but the bob 2.0 like the gold master ce is there
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:58.260]   And I would that needs to go missing and on the internet. So yeah malinda french. I mean, I know
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:02.580]   Malinda french who later became malinda gates and maybe come a little different again probably
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:05.060]   Came to my house to show me bob
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:10.100]   And and I was I was process of reviewing it. I asked my wife what she think you said
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:12.900]   Why would anybody take technology advice from a dog?
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:20.580]   So I gave it a not so great review, but I mean you weren't wrong. It was it was
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:22.820]   But it was fun. My only memory of bob
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:29.140]   My only memory of bob was was when I would go to like the the software stores the mall when I was like in like third grade and stuff
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:33.860]   And I would they would have bob on some of those computers and I would play with it and I would have to like
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:39.380]   Suffer through the terrible bob interface to try to get to the real windows 3.1
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:41.860]   You know interface so I could actually
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:46.260]   Mess with their computers that the sears people were were always very annoyed, but
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:50.980]   That's what you did back in the 90s. That's why you no longer buy computer. That's yours, right?
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:53.140]   Do you remember the animated?
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.820]   search dog in windows xp
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:59.620]   You you remember him? Yes
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:05.700]   And there's and there's merlin too, right? Yeah merlin. Yeah, paul thurat talks about this because when you turn it off
[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.860]   The dog
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:10.900]   Wanders are sadly and then looks back at you
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:15.220]   And then kind of walk goes away and it's like this poor sad dog
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:23.460]   It's a new dog every time. They don't tell you what happens was this turn off. Yes, by the way wasn't malinda gates
[01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:29.620]   You mentioned that right? Yeah, she was a product manager. Yeah, she's a one. Yeah. Yeah, we can blame her
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:34.020]   She's got other problems for you. I don't problems or
[01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:37.140]   opportunities
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:46.100]   I don't know speaking of opportunities. We were talking about microsoft missing an opportunity not spending 45 billion dollars
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:49.860]   To buy yahoo, but apparently son son
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:58.180]   Masayoshi son the guy in charge of soft bank thinks the yahoo brand is still worth a little something he just paid
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:02.260]   1.6 billion dollars for the name
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:06.580]   Amazing for the name from veraitha. Well
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:10.100]   This was the best thing bryzen got for by the way
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:12.980]   Verizon
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:16.660]   Homepage and everything. Yeah, yeah, I still use my soon-to-be former
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:23.380]   I was gonna say they also got a defender to vendor was one of the things we got from that
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:28.980]   Selling and get you as well. Yeah, who owns and I mean, it's all gone. Yeah, it's gonna be
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:34.020]   A holding company whose name I cannot recall. You better remember it quick. Yeah, really
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:42.180]   It's not red ventures. They bought no no red. They've not seen it. They've not
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.900]   It's not whoever
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:51.060]   The scabs to buy his movie. It's a poly fun. There we go. Great. Oh, poly fun. It's not great
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:57.540]   Oh, but these are all these are all private equity funds, right? Yeah. Yeah
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.380]   So
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:03.300]   What's the deal? I mean, what a private equity fund see in these
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:07.220]   Brands that veraitha and hopefully a lot of opportunities
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:15.380]   Maybe Verizon
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:21.620]   Brand that content wasn't their thing and you know, we shouldn't really be focusing on content
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:23.620]   We've got a business to run
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:29.620]   But but Apollo says well, no, this is a valuable asset and gadgets. I think I don't know what's going on with Apollo
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:30.820]   But I think in general
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:35.700]   These things are ad plays for all these private equity funds and then it's like what the media companies try to do
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:41.060]   But the media companies don't have the energy or time or like they don't want to spend that time investing in content
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:45.140]   They just want the ad stuff. So maybe private equity can do better. I don't know
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:50.020]   Yahoo in japan is still a big name apparently. That's of course
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:54.260]   Uh, you know, why suns on uh, why bottom
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:58.820]   Uh home page is still super popular like if if one of my articles
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.420]   Wow
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:06.580]   It's it's like I think the order is if I remember this correctly. I think that it's google
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:10.020]   YouTube yahoo
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:12.020]   Uh
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:15.220]   And then I can't remember the other two because I read this the other day and I was like shock
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:22.740]   See yahoo brands made up four of the top 10 visited websites in japan last year the yahoo japan
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:27.700]   Home page brought in almost the same number of users as youtube
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:33.540]   Wow the yahoo name is used on weather and maps apps finance portals used by day traders
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:41.300]   A discount mobile phone brand run by soft bank yahoo auctions, which is as big as uh ebay
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:46.340]   Um and also a fashion e commerce outlet called zozo
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:49.540]   The mobile payment platform called pay pay
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:53.140]   Love it
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:58.340]   So, uh yahoo is still alive and and if you ever need a job de vendre
[01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:02.180]   japan is calling by the way, I didn't finish. That would be fun
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:10.820]   Here is the team's paint background. We get a little distracted by bob and rover and here's clippy now see that's a great team's background
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:17.380]   It's a good clue. It is. Okay. Honestly, I'm also really glad that they leaned into this because and I probably shouldn't say this but
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:23.300]   The company hasn't always been happy to look back on its past. Let's yeah
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:24.900]   No, that's true
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:27.460]   So so because some of us have tried to use
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:32.020]   Clippy and other things and right things that might be deemed as official and and have been
[01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:38.740]   Very loudly yelled at by the branding police, which is fair. That is their job. No, they're trying to suppress all memory of
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:44.420]   This but but I was really glad to see them like lean into this. I was like, yes. Yeah, clippy is good
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:48.020]   I've just made it my desktop wallpaper. Look at this
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.940]   Uh, that's great. It's linux, but okay, you know
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:58.660]   Yeah nostalgia makes bad things seem good. You know, some eyes will lead in now that you're 30
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:01.460]   Yeah, that's really true, isn't it?
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:04.580]   It was awful then awful
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:10.660]   It was terrible then but we have memories of like our fond times like exactly right?
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:14.100]   It's like it's like for
[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:16.180]   For millennials. It's like the cartoons you grew up with
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.580]   I was like watching you love them. I mean, yeah
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:21.380]   I hated as a kid. I love watching now
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:27.220]   Well, but there has to be sufficient irony. So for instance, if I were to use this windows xp wallpaper
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:31.300]   On this machine people would just think oh, you just have no taste
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:37.300]   No, they go. I think like yeah, but if I use clippy, that's clearly ironic, right?
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.540]   That's that's like a clear
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:42.020]   I'm so cool and hip that I love clippy
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:47.620]   That's I mean, there's an entire musical genre now based on like, you know old window sounds effect
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.780]   So you know
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:53.380]   Well, I was gonna say I love vaporwave so much as both of the genre and like as a fashion
[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:58.500]   I love vaporwave so much. I have so many vaporwave clothing things like what is vaporwave? What are you talking about?
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:43:59.700]   Leo
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:02.100]   Oh, it's so good. It's the best so good
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:04.020]   It's this music genre
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:07.060]   This is also a fashion genre where people take things from the 90s
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:11.620]   And and now it's kind of veering towards early 2000s that it take like the music sounds
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:16.900]   Like the imagery and then they like mash it up and kind of make weird knockoffs. It's so good
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:21.700]   Turn on my sound john. This is the windows startup sound. It's like chill vaporwave music. Yeah
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:24.980]   This is this is a vaporwave
[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:27.220]   Oh wow windows startup sound
[01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:30.340]   And see the whole aesthetic that you'll see people make it
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:34.420]   Is it like it's the most seen or I mean, what is it? What's going on?
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:40.900]   It's something being played through memory and like there's always a lot of like electronic like yeah stuff added to it
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:46.180]   It's it's fascinating to me is like a reflection of culture. This is absolutely fascinating
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:48.180]   This is actually
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:49.860]   God
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:51.860]   This is like the ring video
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:58.260]   Except protect people. This is like it looks like it's on a bad vhs tape. Yeah, and uh, yeah
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:02.980]   That's why go to public go to public space. Yeah xyz
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:09.060]   And you can see some of the clothing I own I spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on their clothing
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:12.420]   I have like I have this great. I have this great hoodie
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:18.100]   That's like half the apple logo half the microsoft windows logo and and it says like apple 95
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:24.980]   It's kind of it's remixing kind it's remixing retro and especially for I think uh, you know jenzi kids who
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:30.980]   Didn't barely even live through it too. It's like it's a way of reliving it. It's the way like 70 stuff was hot in the 90s
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:38.260]   It's fascinating. Yeah, so uh is this oh look there's the windows logo windows 95 you do
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:42.100]   See I could see we're in this around microsoft. You would look very hip
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:44.340]   Oh, yeah, no people people love it
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:48.660]   I get so many comments on a lot of the stuff that I wear and like when I um, it's on hey
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:53.620]   Just right now what I do like my weekly youtube show. I always wear funny. You have to have something like that. Yeah
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:56.100]   Well, and well my whole

[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:05.140]   They're merging the instagram with pom-pomol or marlboro and then filtered
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:11.380]   So it's like it's a mashup of cigarettes and instagram. They implying that instagram is addictive and harmful
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:13.380]   I don't know
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:16.100]   Exactly. This is really oh here's polaroid

[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:37.860]   My last 16 hour flight I wrote I wore f leisure and it was the best decision I ever made so

[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:02.500]   Oh, you mean that's all it is. Oh

[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:13.620]   It's really comfortable. That's the main so you're the kids who made fun of us for wearing leisure suits, right?
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.700]   And sweat right it has nothing
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.900]   That is
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:24.820]   And and and and the thing with what good athleisure is that it is designed so that it could also kind of be streetwear
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:28.260]   So is it the letter f plus leisure?
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:31.140]   athleisure
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:38.820]   Are my bikeshorts are they going to be cool again the ones that might like no never wear bike shorts and never
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:41.140]   Bikeshorts never where they're sure they are
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:43.700]   Please tell me how sure they are
[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:49.460]   Okay, i'm not wearing it athleisure anywhere
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:52.740]   You can do no the whole trend is like
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:48:00.420]   Genuinely and and I say this like with total self-awareness that i've spent like i bought 120 dollar pair of
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:06.740]   You know like yoga pants leggings that I will never wear for yoga or working out that are strictly designed for like
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:12.820]   You know the streetwear aesthetic that you pair with like el magazine calls this the clothing style that confuses the viewers
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:16.420]   With its will they won't they go work out us that right?
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:23.140]   Absolutely, right it's great. Listen. It's better than sweatpants. Okay. I always felt like sweat pants are just giving up
[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:28.340]   That has become a hit like popular fashion thing too athleisure is at least a little sleeker
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:33.060]   You will be reassured larry that apparently it's blazers with biker shorts
[01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:46.100]   Yeah, okay, you know actually I got some watery
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:52.020]   Close and they're very comfortable. That's there's a nike pro job. That's nice. I like that
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:58.660]   Okay, it's it's stuff like what you're looking at like the track jacket. Okay. Yeah bring the track jacket and some running

[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:08.820]   So people think you're always great shape when they when you wear this right? They think you work out. No, it has nothing to do with
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:15.220]   No, they don't even try to leave zero. Yeah, okay. I got it. You guys try the leggings leo

[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:32.580]   This is why i thought you're going to Hawaii Leo you get a big one. I'm wearing Don Ho Hawaiian shirts
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:34.580]   I'm not wearing the athleisure
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:38.420]   Are you excited about the switch OLED model?
[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:44.900]   $350 the guts are the same, but it's got a nice big OLED screen same size device
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:50.260]   But it's got a smaller bezel. That's that's the this is this was the drama of the week, right?
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:53.380]   Because all the video game media was like um
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:58.740]   There were a lot of leaks even Bloomberg was reporting that it was gonna be like a switch with 4k upscaling
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:00.740]   Yeah
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:01.700]   technology
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:04.900]   Yeah, and um, it's like everybody forgot what Nintendo does
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:11.300]   And what Nintendo does is usually the bare minimum and like hey yeah OLED screen everything else is the same
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:13.620]   And then either net core on the dock love it
[01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:15.620]   They're like we're gonna squeeze as much money
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:22.500]   Out of this console as we can like just like they did with the Game Boy and and with the the ds series and the ds and everything man
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:25.940]   Yeah, I mean, I I joked on twitter. I was like well
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:29.140]   I'm glad I don't have to buy the new I don't have to buy my fifth Nintendo switch
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:31.300]   But you will you will

[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:46.980]   One of them is one that I got specifically it was a first gen one og one that that I got for um to hack
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:53.540]   Okay, um without getting banned because my og day one one that I like don't want to hack it because if you go online
[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:58.500]   Accidentally with it then they'll ban you oh they'll ban they'll be in that switch from that from going online
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:01.380]   I didn't want to deal with that but I wanted to hack it and play around with homebrew stuff
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:03.380]   So that's what the what one of them is for?
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:06.820]   My original so my so my original one I have my um

[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:30.180]   So obviously the thing is like it's it's easy to make fun of this but uh we don't talk enough about how
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:36.500]   Terrible the switch screen is it's really bad outdoors. It is bad. I can't play
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:40.900]   I can't play it's on my tv most of the time and it's yeah
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:45.220]   You know, so I think for people who play portably um the old light is beautiful
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:49.380]   I will you know fight to the death uh about the advantages of ole over everything
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:52.900]   So yeah, this would be a much bigger screen. They do like a nice
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:59.380]   Upgrade like uh in person like a live upgrade of what you know the difference is screen is versus the old one
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:05.620]   It looks like it's sick of seven inches versus 6.2. That's like noticeable on a device at small
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.220]   um
[01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:11.860]   And the ole it looks better. It just looks so much better. And also the colorway. It looks really good
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:19.460]   Like looks good white. I'm really into in our chatroom firefox nx says the nintendo ole it is the athleisure of game consoles
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:21.540]   Is that I mean, that's a great thing
[01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:27.220]   Absolutely. I think that's brilliant. That's actually it's a price lulu lemon pants. Yeah
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:31.460]   Yeah, this is why you buy it for the for the aesthetic and for the flex. Absolutely
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:37.220]   This has been a problem though this year you couldn't get I mean the microsoft has said yeah, we're not gonna have uh
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:42.500]   The new xbox series x and supply anytime soon and especially place is
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:47.300]   Yeah, playstation 5 very hard to find if you you know if you got one you were lucky
[01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:53.620]   Uh, this is even the switch and they say available october 8 but you have to wonder with chip shortages and so forth
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:55.620]   How hard is this gonna get?
[01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:57.620]   I've already had like three people
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:03.060]   King me who want them because like one person they gave their old swishes someone else another person like they just they know
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:04.820]   They know that you're
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:09.700]   Very good. Yes, they know they know on the person they're like, yeah, yes, they're like christen. You have to
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:14.820]   Switch a little bit your strategy for uh acquiring one of these
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:19.140]   Okay, so then your two main tools for this while they're three
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:23.860]   But your your main tools are going to be discord and twitter and so you want to set up alerts on both of them
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:29.220]   You want to join a number of different discord where they have drops and they will send notifications
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:32.900]   For when things go out uh twitter is the same way there's certain
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:38.420]   Of people you can follow and you turn notifications on for that person and you get alerts the other thing
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:43.460]   Where is 64 especially? Yeah, wario 64 is great, but there's some other ones to what's that?
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.780]   That's a person
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:50.580]   He's a person and and he finds all the latest deals and links and stuff that works
[01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:56.100]   Uh, but he's how can you both know this if you two knows everybody knows this right?
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.740]   That's the problem
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.780]   Can you help me get some bicycle pants? I'm trying to buy a bicycle, right?
[01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:06.740]   And you can buy the see this is becoming the problem everybody knows all the tricks
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.940]   You can buy the really cheap ones in the really so if I want to buy a 400
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:12.820]   Hour bicycle easy if I want to buy a 10 000 dollar bicycle easy
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:16.740]   But try to find a 1500 dollar bicycle. They're like completely
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:22.100]   Backward until next year. Yeah chip shortage too. No, I don't know what the other Chinese motors
[01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:26.820]   Colovid no, they don't chips in these bicycles that I know well the e-bike thing has gotten really big
[01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:33.300]   Yeah, because there's a big thing there but a continue christian, but even analyze I got it
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:36.180]   Okay, so now which discord servers do I have to show?
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:41.860]   I'm following warrior 64. I'm now
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:45.060]   There are a lot of discourse
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:49.700]   And some of them work better than others because I'm in a bunch of them some for video games some for graphics cards
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:57.220]   Some are CPUs like whatever some for shoes. I just want to point out wario 64 has one million followers
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:04.580]   Yes, he is posting with affiliate links, which makes yes means he's probably making making a ton of 100
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:07.140]   A lot of money doing this
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:12.900]   And and he doesn't sleep and the thing is is that it's my knowledge. He's not body. He means a castor mattress
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:17.540]   By links is it he's he's is it a group of people or do we know it's just one person that I don't know?
[01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:19.860]   I don't know. Yeah, I think it's only one person because
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:25.460]   There have been times when and because this happened when I was able to score so many ps5s in the
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:29.860]   Slide into your your gossip girl D. No, no, he did not slide on my DMS
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:35.860]   No, but what happened was that he would go to sleep and I was up at like like two three o'clock in the morning pacific time
[01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:41.060]   I would catch drops from some other people and he would then wake up and have had missed the drop, right?
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:46.420]   So this is why you sometimes have to follow both people and multiple discourse to get people when they're awake
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:51.060]   That's the other thing too. So the main thing is you get these notifications now. Everybody gets them
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:55.780]   It's a lot harder than it used to be but and this is the most important thing once you have these notifications
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:59.060]   You need to be ready to go. That means you need to have your payment information
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:05.300]   Pre-configured in your browser if it is for the main retailer like best buy or amazon or walmart or whatever
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:09.540]   You need an account. You need to be signed and you need to have it ready to go because you might have seconds
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:13.140]   I'm not even kidding. You have seconds coffee is for clothes. You got to be a closer
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:17.700]   Coffee is the closer like like like the day that I scored three ps5s in one day
[01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:22.820]   Which was my birthday I might add like it was because I was just on it and I had all
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:29.220]   Problem your problem your buying that's two people who couldn't get a ps5
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:33.220]   I sold them at cost. I mean okay
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:38.420]   And had them shipped directly to my friends. I am not the problem. I am the good person here
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:42.740]   I could have like made thousand dollars and I made nothing. I've made
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:46.500]   How you were outraged that I suggested that you just like
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:55.060]   Because I'm not the problem. I'm like actually going out of my way to help people like I'm actively going out of my way to help
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:57:05.220]   We should we should mention like I think people who have the original switch if they if you did not get the refresh switch in 2019
[01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:09.700]   Which has the better battery chips that and better battery up to nine hours of battery
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:12.740]   That is a good reason to upgrade because then you get much better battery
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:16.660]   Unportable and you get OLED and you get better speakers although we don't know what that's gonna be
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:21.860]   Um, so this is an upgrade from the original switch not so much from the upgraded switch of a couple
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:25.620]   Exactly and because I have the animal crossing when I have the upgraded
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:29.620]   Which was another reason why I bought the animal crossing one for my
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:32.420]   Overwhelming and the lovely pastel colors
[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:36.420]   Well, it was mostly as the aesthetic but I was able to justify it by saying
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:41.060]   Oh, well, it's also newer and has their battery life and like my OG one
[01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:46.260]   Yeah, are you still actually content is getting some heat because they haven't really updated animal crossing in a while
[01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:51.460]   I know I haven't played it that much in the last I lost interest. Yeah, I I decided to be a Viking instead
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:56.260]   So it's been a year, you know, like I don't know. I don't know what else is gonna happen there
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:58:03.620]   But uh, while we're also talking about this. I don't think the idea of the switch pro the switch pro was that 4k upscaling thing using dlss
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:08.340]   Um, that's probably not death that could easily happen. No, I don't think so that was the rumor
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:12.180]   So you think that that ships. Yeah, that's the problem. Yeah, no chips
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:14.500]   Because it would be it would mean a whole new tegra processor
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:21.060]   A deal assess and everything. Yeah, whole new tegra and now they could just use what they've been using for the past
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:25.940]   You know exactly they can continue fapping those they're using Nvidia chips now
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:30.260]   They're using the tegra x1 right? Okay. The x1 which is actually a very good chip
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:35.300]   It's very good. It's what's in this. It's it's in the Nvidia shield. Yeah. Yeah, I have one in the shield
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:37.060]   And it's it's a very powerful ship
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:41.060]   Uh, but they if you if you're an upgrade you have to have a better chip
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:45.220]   So they need a better chip than that and and nobody in Nvidia is not doing that right now
[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:49.380]   And when they would turn knowledge they'd have to have a custom one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:53.460]   Whereas the existing one was like the existing, you know x1
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:56.420]   I
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:58.900]   I'm probably the only one on this panel who isn't a gamer
[01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:05.140]   So everything what's wrong with you there. I still want to get Larry a switch. Yeah, give me a bicycle. I'm happy
[01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:13.140]   Without what you really want is a bicycle with a that powers your game machine so that's exactly in game at the same time
[01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:17.380]   I've often thought especially when I was playing world of warcraft and there's a lot of running around
[01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:23.940]   I thought it'd be really good if I were actually running like if I had a treadmill and I were running do that set up a laptop stand
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:27.780]   Yeah, yeah, and you could wear these at leisure pants. Oh, no, you can't actually
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:30.100]   athleisure athleisure
[01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:36.420]   Let me take a little break. I'm exhausted just the the whole process of buying a nintendo
[01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:42.900]   You on so much culture. Oh my god somebody in the chatroom said one of the strangest twits in recent memory. Absolutely

[01:59:56.420 --> 01:59:58.980]   We're gonna come back more of the show great panel
[01:59:58.980 --> 02:00:02.020]   uh, but
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:06.820]   We had such a good week on twit. I thought you should watch this little mini movie watch this divindra. It's good
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:13.940]   All right, that's a good exercise. Let me look at what youtube recommends for me twit the sadoku for people who don't like sadoku
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:21.460]   How do you make a video out of sadoku? Well, jam. It's fascinating
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:25.300]   Previously on twit
[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:34.340]   Security now the so-called windows print nightmare was overshadowed by the sodino kibi malware
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:39.300]   Which the reval ransam where gang managed to infiltrate into kasea?
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:40.740]   servers
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:45.300]   We have at least now the worst ransam where event in history
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:51.380]   All about android, you know where the people also are they are absolutely on pokemon go
[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:56.260]   Which is celebrating an anniversary this week pokemon go is five years old
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:01:01.540]   It is made five billion dollars in revenue for player spending in the last five years
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:05.140]   Five billion man. That's all that's a lot of money for one game
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:07.700]   That is just
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:09.220]   Insanity to me
[02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:10.500]   windows weekly
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:15.540]   Microsoft is uh gonna lose that jedi deal the dod has canceled it right
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:20.100]   They're gonna redo the contract and rebuild the contract. It's now instead of called jedi
[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:23.780]   It's called joint warfare cloud capability
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:28.340]   So it's gonna be a multi cloud deal this time, which it should have been the first time right?
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:30.660]   Yeah, all of them could win
[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:32.340]   Then yeah, yeah, I didn't
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:37.140]   I didn't do it. We're no strangers to love you know the rules and so do I
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:43.700]   Our show today actually this is a really interesting company. It's brought to you by
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:49.460]   Our crowd have you heard about these guys? This is really interesting a bunch of venture capitalists got together
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:51.700]   And said you know what we could do
[02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:56.500]   But what we should do is give people a chance to participate in our deal flow
[02:01:56.500 --> 02:02:00.260]   Right the whole thing that makes you a successful investor
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:04.740]   Is that you get access to these deals before anybody else does you can get in
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:09.300]   Before the exit before the ipo or the acquisition and really
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:15.780]   Make some money if you wish you were in on some of the best performing ipos of the last couple of years
[02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:19.140]   You need to know about our crowd our crowd investors were
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:24.260]   And now you can join them in what's next now with our crowd
[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:31.460]   You need to be an accredited investor and you'll have access to invest directly easily and most importantly early
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:36.660]   On some of these very exciting new companies our crowd investors have benefited
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:40.820]   From our crowd companies ipoing. I'll give you some examples like beyond meat
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:45.460]   Or being bought by companies like intel or nike your microsoft or oracle
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:49.700]   So those exits are really are really what where you make your your money
[02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:54.340]   But the problem is you have to get in before the exit you have to get an early you have to get the access
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:03:00.260]   That's where our crowd can help. They are venture capitalists their investment professionals
[02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:03.780]   They have an extensive network and they're ready to let you in
[02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:11.540]   To some of the most promising private companies and startups in the world. They do very deep due diligence
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:14.580]   So you don't have to they meet with management teams
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:21.060]   They they they do very comprehensive vetting of deals because they're about to make them part of their own portfolio
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:23.220]   That's the thing that's important to understand
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:25.780]   They're participating in this
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:31.940]   Uh, and they're giving you a chance to participate. So this is they're doing the research for their own portfolios as well
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:38.180]   Once our crowd has selected a deal they offer accredited investors the opportunity invest alongside of them

[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:24.500]   You have to have a certain net worth a certain income to be an accredited investor
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:28.420]   This is to protect people, you know from betting the rent on this stuff
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:32.020]   But if you're at the stage in your life where you're making investments
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:37.380]   And you're trying to go beyond, you know, just the average mutual fund you and you're looking at

[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:10.580]   And they and they have chosen dozens of companies that have made exits
[02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:15.460]   Accredited investors can participate in single company deals for and I want to be up front
[02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:21.300]   So you understand this isn't for everybody, but if if it typically of as little as $10,000
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:24.500]   You can they also have funds
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:29.700]   Combining a variety of investments. You can get in one of the our crowd funds for as little as $50,000
[02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:36.340]   But a minimum of 10,000 is required to invest the investment terms may vary depending on your jurisdiction

[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:04.420]   cost they use AI models
[02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:09.220]   Of the human body a molecular level completely changing what's possible
[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:16.340]   In this huge trillion-dollar drug development landscape very interesting stuff at the at the very least you'll get to get
[02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:23.620]   Read the documentation learn about it and if you decide to you can get an early on cyto reason and other unique opportunities our crowd

[02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:44.580]   I think this is kind of an unusual and interesting
[02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:47.620]   Sponsor when they came to us. I said that's very interesting
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:51.860]   I want to tell people about our crowd dot com slash
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:54.660]   Twit
[02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:56.340]   Um
[02:06:56.340 --> 02:06:57.300]   Jedi
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:02.340]   Contract, I'm sorry Christina. I know you were all excited about this 10 billion dollar pentagon contract
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:04.980]   Pentagon's canceled that microsoft wanted
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:12.820]   Amazon was pissed. They said it was political and they slowed it down so much a pentagon threw up their hands and said oh screw it
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:18.100]   So that was going to be a big business for microsoft a billion dollars a year
[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:22.820]   They replaced it with something. They're calling a multi vendor cloud computing
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:25.460]   contract mv
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:27.860]   CC
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:34.580]   Only two vents. Yeah, exactly. And then and then the only two vendors this multi vendor thing are Amazon and Microsoft
[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:41.540]   So you both win everybody wins everybody gets a trophy look like Seattle Seattle wins basically, right? Like yeah
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:45.540]   Washington state wins is is how it ends up, you know, it's
[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:50.820]   Maybe maybe you guys are the right guys to to ask about this, but it does seem to me
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:55.460]   So the pentagon wanted to really update their cloud infrastructure for security and
[02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:59.140]   You know, there's good reasons to do this. Uh, they bit it out oracle
[02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:06.340]   Wanted it. Uh Amazon wanted it. Microsoft ended up getting it and and but the court battles have just you know killed it
[02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:08.820]   They need it so they decided to go
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:11.700]   For a multi vendor cloud
[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:17.060]   Isn't that kind of the way to go these days anyway? Isn't that the right thing to do or is that
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:22.020]   Too complicated for the department of defense. I think it depends on what they're doing
[02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:24.180]   But I'll let you go on
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:26.820]   I think from a security standpoint it makes sense to have
[02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:30.500]   Not a single point of failure. Yeah, I think multi home
[02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:36.580]   Multi cloud environments are kind of the the wave of the future anyway. They're very hot right now
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:43.300]   Especially after all these ransomware attacks we're seeing. Yeah, yeah a single point has led to disaster for a lot of companies
[02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:48.500]   Yeah, these this cloud will host not just unclassified material, but secret and even top secret material
[02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:52.500]   So security is really important. It has to be global
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:57.300]   Right and that becomes that I guess to me would be the question about some of the secured stuff
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:01.060]   I would imagine that in those cases you wouldn't necessarily be able to have a multi cloud thing because
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:06.500]   Like our government cloud and Amazon's government clouds are stored in these like secure, you know
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:09.620]   like locations and separate data centers and
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:15.780]   I think that the way that you would set that stuff up would be that you wouldn't necessarily make that interoperable
[02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:23.140]   With another cloud vendor, right? So it might be one of those things where for some types of things you use one service for other types of things
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:27.700]   You use another so I'm not sure how they'll figure that out. It definitely makes it more complicated
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:33.140]   There's no no question about that and complexity maybe is the enemy of reliability and security
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:35.620]   maybe
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:39.060]   But redundancy isn't a bad idea. Yeah, I think the challenge
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:43.620]   The challenge and I think this is true for all the different cloud services is that
[02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:50.020]   All of the companies have their own kind of special sauce and they're way of doing different manage offerings and different things
[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:53.780]   And yes, you can have kubernetes and you can have kind of your own
[02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:57.860]   You know like kind of third party like plane to be able to have like cross, you know
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:00.660]   Support across the different services
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:03.540]   But the way that Amazon system for certain things works
[02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:06.100]   It's going to be different the way that azure system works for different things
[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:09.300]   Which is going to be different than how oracles works or or google clouds works
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:16.100]   And so the more that you really go all in with that vendor and use a lot of the stuff that they've optimized in a specific way
[02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:23.780]   The harder it is to replicate or have a one-to-one experience with those same source of features with another cloud
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:26.660]   So in that case, maybe you look at it as like, okay
[02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:32.180]   We're not going to be using some of these, you know, try it and true like really like, you know
[02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:35.140]   More more efficient, you know managed services and we're just going to be
[02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:40.660]   Trying to to use it more as you know a data center play. I'm not sure what they're going to be doing
[02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:44.100]   I'm not I don't work on that part of it, but I do work on azure so
[02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:48.980]   I just hope the dod has some very talented it professionals because
[02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:51.780]   They're not using cassia and solar winds either
[02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:56.980]   You know connect safely for example now with using amazon web services for our website
[02:10:56.980 --> 02:11:00.740]   Yeah, we do for ours incredibly complicated. Oh, yeah, I mean I had a higher a guy
[02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:05.700]   Oh, you got a higher a guy. I mean and I back when I was on hostgator. I could manage it myself
[02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:07.700]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:12.100]   We you know I was stunned we said when we did our new website maybe five years ago
[02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:13.780]   We're running
[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:20.580]   We're running on this and now there's redis and there's erroku there. It's running on three or four different servers
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:23.220]   It's uh, we're running through
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:25.060]   Amazon's cloud front
[02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:29.060]   Uh, we're I mean it is so complicated. Thank goodness. We have a good
[02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:34.740]   It guy rustle knows what he's doing, but yeah, I don't know how I mean the the
[02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:37.380]   World has gotten more complicated not less
[02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:42.100]   But we are on multiple different servers and I guess there's reasons to do that, you know, yeah
[02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:45.780]   Uh, let's see
[02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:48.100]   Uh, pokémon go
[02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:50.740]   back to the fun stuff
[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:52.340]   pokémon go
[02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:56.340]   Uh, this is the fifth anniversary it launched five years ago 2016
[02:11:56.340 --> 02:12:03.060]   Five billion dollars in revenue for niantic the company that does it five
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:07.060]   Not only five billion dollars, but it's going up
[02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:12.500]   The first half of 2021 is the pokémon goes best ever start to a year
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:16.260]   Revenue is up 34 from the first half of 2020
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:20.180]   130 from the first half of 2017 the first year
[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:22.740]   uh that they were around it is
[02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:25.460]   Still a big hit
[02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:32.580]   We still see crowds of people like wandering with the phones and doing the things and I think they relaxed some location rules, right?
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:36.820]   Uh, to help with pandemic, uh, you know, actually playing and everything
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:44.900]   So that probably that's probably the most popular application of augmented reality. Oh easily. That's my father. My far. Yeah. Yeah
[02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:47.860]   I love that. Good for them. Yeah
[02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:50.580]   Like I think a lot of us were wrong
[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:53.940]   We wrote it off as being kind of like a summer fad because we stopped using it
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:57.780]   But the users didn't and it's big they've continued to add more things to it
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:03.140]   And they've I have to give niantic a lot of credit because they've really embraced the community around it and really listened to them
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:05.220]   and um
[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:11.540]   It's it's interesting to me that we haven't seen necessarily like other IPs and other games from niantic
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:15.540]   You know, like seems like pokémon go is basically their big thing, which is okay
[02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:21.060]   They flopped with the harry the harry potter game flopped. I was all excited. I thought oh, this is gonna be great
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:26.420]   And it was I guess too grindy. So it it's interesting. It's hard to do a
[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:33.620]   It is and it's hard to do a follow-up. I always think of um who was the studio who did kim kardashian's hollywood glue glue glue
[02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:37.140]   Glue interactive or whatever. Yeah, um
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:41.620]   Kim kardashian's hollywood was a good game like it was it was a lot of fun. Yeah
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:46.340]   I mean, it should be maybe illegal the way that they had like a cino type of thing with it
[02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:48.180]   But but it was it was a fun game
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:53.140]   But then they had like the the katie perry follow-up which flopped and the tears was follow-up, which was terrible
[02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:57.700]   And i'm saying killers with fan and yeah, you can't blame the artists for that anymore than you could say
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:01.620]   Oh, the problem is harry potter isn't as popular as pokémon. That's not the case
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:05.460]   No, it's just sometimes you just you know, it's slightly in a bottle
[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:08.660]   It's like within the other creative endeavors sometimes you're gonna have hits and sometimes you're not but
[02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:17.140]   It's a little more accessible. You have the older fans you have the young fans like it is a broad swath of people that can play that
[02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:23.300]   And my wife still plays it. She loves it. Yeah. Yeah, it's also kind of language agnostic in a way. You know what i mean?
[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:25.300]   Like you you don't even
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:28.660]   In fact, I think I did this last week
[02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:32.980]   But you know, we we left we're pulling out of f-scanis standpoint a little bit early
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:35.780]   We left bagram air force base a couple of weeks ago
[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:40.980]   Turns out the the air force personnel who were stationed there were playing pokémon go like crazy
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:48.020]   Of course you can you can change your location and your phone and go there and you'll see there's all these gyms occupied
[02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:52.020]   By pokémon with zero hit points because they've been there a long time
[02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:56.260]   They're kind of for lornin but draggle but because no one's trying to take the gyms back
[02:14:56.260 --> 02:15:03.700]   We still we may not hold bagram air force base, but we hold the gym at bagram air force base pokémon go
[02:15:04.420 --> 02:15:10.020]   Still lives there. I remember playing it when it came out and I didn't even realize it was still around
[02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:12.820]   I mean, it's huge fun for a bigger now than ever
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:15.940]   I create bigger now than ever. You see the crowds of people
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:20.260]   They're like and sometimes it's sort of like watching like zombies from the walking dead or something
[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:23.620]   Just like a crowd of people just staring down and then they all move together
[02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:26.580]   And you know they're playing because they're they're their fingers are going around
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:29.140]   I thought they were showing up to see me though
[02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:34.260]   Sorry, we were in san diego when pokémon go came out in 2016
[02:15:34.420 --> 02:15:39.700]   Wow, yeah, and there were all it was I thought oh there's a concert going on because there's all these people in the median
[02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:42.740]   of the strip there and
[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:47.700]   They're all it's jammed shoulder to shoulder and I said is there somebody playing and I couldn't I didn't see it
[02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:51.300]   They were all playing pokémon go and there was a big battle going on
[02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:54.260]   It was amazing and it was fun to be a part of at the time
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:58.580]   And it was good that they relaxed those location requirements during covid
[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:04.820]   The interesting thing is they're talking about bringing them back and I'm saying you guys are making more money than ever
[02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:07.380]   Maybe you should just leave that
[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:09.700]   Yeah, why why mess with a good thing?
[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:13.220]   It's uh, it must be hard to balance. That's the thing
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:18.420]   I was gonna say there's the balance to it. I'm sure because like, you know
[02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:21.300]   They have their in-person events that have been widely successful
[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:25.140]   Successful, but there's a lot of accessibility arguments for it
[02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:31.780]   Like that's I've seen a lot of people writing about that like it it's really hard to go out to physical play sometimes and get to a specific thing
[02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:35.540]   Or you can't move as quickly to follow some some pokémon that's out there
[02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:38.420]   Um, wanna point out that they did show us a glimpse
[02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:43.860]   It released like an anime glimpse of where it would be like on halo lens too. That's right. That was kind of fun
[02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:49.460]   And they never never really never happened. Yeah, I mean
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:51.220]   It's it was just like a pre-rendered demo
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:56.740]   But I think it's the idea of what they could do with that eventually like once if we had if we all had air our glasses
[02:16:56.740 --> 02:17:00.260]   Like you you bet we would still be playing. Oh god the zombies
[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:03.540]   Yeah, everybody be wandering around
[02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:07.140]   Walking into traffic
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:10.260]   Yeah, come on. I can't I it's gonna be a nightmare
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:14.900]   I mean if we had air glasses people might not have stayed indoors with with covid
[02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:19.220]   I'm not joking like you might have had like who would have been unwilling to stay indoors
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:23.860]   Be like oh, I can would walk around and everything's empty. It's great. It's like dude stay inside
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:29.460]   We as you know, 4th of july was last sine for we very rarely miss a twit
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:36.020]   We did a twit on saturday. So I unfortunately couldn't play this for you then but I'm gonna play it for you now mark succerberg
[02:17:36.020 --> 02:17:41.380]   On a wakeboard wave in the american flag wishing you all
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:43.780]   The Delaware river. Oh, yeah, right ready
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:47.540]   No, don't play the audio because then we'll get a take down from john denver
[02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:54.420]   Uh wishing you all a very happy independence day. You guys are great. This was the best twit ever
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:56.980]   Well, at least the weirdest. Thank you film girl
[02:17:56.980 --> 02:18:04.500]   It's so it's always a pleasure to having you on christina warren senior cloud advocate at microsoft at film girl. You can do anything for inspire
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:10.740]   I am not involved in an sire, but I've there will be cool stuff coming. I know there will be cool stuff
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:13.220]   You excited about windows 11?
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:15.460]   I'm very excited about windows 11 actually
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:20.740]   I'm running it right now on the machine that i'm doing this from so what you're old you're brave
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:24.980]   You've got a better machine. It's very stable. Yeah, right?
[02:18:24.980 --> 02:18:27.700]   Well, can you help my friend larry here?
[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:32.260]   I have a three-year-old pc that won't run it. Oh because you have a 7th generation
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:34.660]   I have a 7th generation. Yeah, I know
[02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:37.300]   It'll run the the public release
[02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:42.660]   My theory on all this and you can you don't have to you just pull your ear from right christina is
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:49.540]   The problem when when a new version of windows comes out is there's going to be a whole bunch of people say oh
[02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:55.540]   Especially when you have cosmetic changes. I don't want that don't make me change people did that with windows 10. Yeah, don't make me change
[02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:59.860]   Well, it was really windows 8 but yeah windows 8 don't make me change. I don't like that
[02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:06.420]   So microsoft thought now what if we made it so you couldn't have it? Oh people then what and they did and people
[02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:09.300]   Windows 11. I want it. Yeah
[02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:14.100]   Right, I don't think that's how you're here. Come on. Come on. I know no, okay
[02:19:14.100 --> 02:19:18.900]   I mean it makes sense. If bonewind used hysteria, no, I don't think that's the reason
[02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:22.740]   I would say like I think they're looking into it. They've said they're gonna look for the feedback
[02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:25.220]   There are some different driver requirements
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:28.580]   that that they want for security standpoint and
[02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:35.220]   So maybe that I think yeah without with the vendors it might have to do with no time inspector because the mitigation
[02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:40.500]   Absolutely, all right generation and later it might have to do you know the tp you requirement
[02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:45.700]   I think you could safely say is about security well the other cynical argument is microsoft doesn't make any money
[02:19:45.700 --> 02:19:49.620]   If I upgrade my three-year-old machine, but they do make some money if I buy a new windows machine
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:54.180]   I think that's also I'm not saying I'm not saying that that's right the issue
[02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:58.340]   But it is in fact the case well don't be such a cheapskate buy a new machine
[02:19:58.340 --> 02:20:02.180]   Help it's gonna happen. Yeah, it's gonna happen. I'm gonna have to have it
