[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   We are at Momo, yeah.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.100]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.600]   And we are at our back end.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600]   A whole bunch of Twit heads with us today.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.560]   And you are great.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.720]   You guys are great.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.660]   We are at South by Southwest, which, of course,
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.400]   is where the geeks gather every year.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.320]   Nerd Fest 2011, South by Southwest Interactive.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.120]   And we have such a great bunch of people on Twit.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.560]   We have probably 20 people on Twit.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.840]   So we're going to move through it pretty quickly
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.640]   and maybe get some more people in here and everything.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.360]   But let me introduce the beginnings.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.600]   What a great panel to start it off, starting
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.200]   on all the way on stage right with Ryan Block from gadget.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.360]   gdgt.com.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.960]   So the next to him is partner Peter Rojas, also from gadget.com.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.860]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.980]   Jeff Jarvis from this week and Google the author.
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.140]   What would Google do?
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140]   Jeff Tread.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.820]   Well, Jeff Tread.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.860]   Next to him, Gina Chaponi, a formerly life hacker.
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.860]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.020]   Nice matter with our lord.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.180]   Everybody's favorite geeks.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.460]   She's got the geek watch too.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.380]   She's got that very cool watch with the nanol.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.900]   Make it up.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.660]   Make it up.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.420]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.420]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.420]   Nice.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.420]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.600]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.140]   They were handing out onion papers.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.640]   There's actually a physical paper.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.680]   We have a special South by Southwest edition
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.100]   of America's finest newspaper content rolling out
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.840]   this week on the web.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.380]   It's amazing.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.020]   It's incredible.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.720]   We're covering it.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.600]   Pseudolive.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   Pseudolive.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.120]   Pseudolive.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.640]   I love the onion.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.160]   It's awesome.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.360]   Good.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.920]   It's always good to have you on bare today.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.480]   Also sitting right next to him at Callie Lewis, Callie Lewis
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.240]   from gggt.tv.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.840]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.100]   And my crowd surfing partner here, Lisa Bettany.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.100]   She mostly Lisa.com.
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.460]   She's also, of course, the host of our new photography show,
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.780]   mostly photo.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.580]   But you crowd surfed last night.
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.320]   Right now I did.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.020]   At the Ignatian party, I said I would never do it again.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.100]   And then Kevin, he's a little rabble rouser.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.780]   He got them chanting, lee-o-lee.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.180]   And we had to do it.
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.020]   And so I'm standing there next to you.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.340]   And I said, hey, I'll do it if you'll do it.
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.820]   And she said she would.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.020]   Which is brave, because women don't usually crowd surf.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.760]   Well, I thought it'd be a first, you know?
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.040]   It was a first.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.600]   We got in the Universal Database, record database,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.400]   for longest crowd surf, first co-ed crowd surf,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.840]   and biggest crowd surf.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.040]   Because we had five people, Kevin and Alex, you and me,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.360]   Brian Brushwood and David Prager.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.840]   Nice.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.000]   That's like six people.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.200]   And by the way, there weren't enough people to hold us all.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.760]   I noticed--
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.600]   It was a bumpy ride.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.440]   It was a bumpy ride.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.000]   They kept you suspended.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.780]   I'm going up and down, up and down.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.080]   My pants almost came off.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.340]   I'm sure Alex always wants this, man.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.220]   Oh my god.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.260]   Kind of crowd surf.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.420]   I'm never doing that again.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.060]   I thought naked--
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.620]   Next year, naked crowd surf.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.100]   I'm on the ground.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.540]   You're on your own.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.180]   It was a tattoo, lee-o.
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.580]   My pants are always fall, man.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.620]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.300]   I was suggesting what Leo should do this year up last year
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.180]   was to get a tat-tat-two on his ass.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.140]   He wouldn't do it.
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.460]   The crowd surfing shot.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.740]   What an idea why he would do that.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.240]   Do it!
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.740]   Do it!
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.240]   No, no.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.660]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.160]   Do it!
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   Tat-too!
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.660]   Do it!
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.160]   Tat-too!
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.860]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.100]   So you know, there was news this week.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.100]   There's a lot of news this week.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.060]   There was a pop-up store selling the iPad, too.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.100]   I want to talk about that.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.980]   But as long as we've got Peter and Ryan here,
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.420]   I think I really ought to put you guys on the spot.
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.500]   Big story coming out of Engadget, the editor-in-chief,
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.300]   Joshua Topolsky, who was on this show last week.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.620]   And his partner, Nele Patel, both quitting Engadget,
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.620]   he's an editor-in-large like you are, Ryan.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.640]   What the hell does that mean?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.840]   It's an honorary title.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.440]   So did he leave and disgrace apparently not?
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.160]   What happened?
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.080]   Well, it looks like--
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.480]   I'm not there anymore, so I can't say for sure.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.840]   But you must have some insight.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.080]   Yeah, well, I mean both of us at one point left Engadget,
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.040]   left AOL.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.840]   Yeah, I mean, it just looks like things
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.040]   weren't super amazing at AOL.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.440]   And he had to do his thing and he lies well.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.000]   Two things happened that I might have been triggering events.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.300]   One is they allowed Mike Errington to go unchallenged,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.120]   really slamming Engadget.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.540]   Mike, of course, runs TechCrunch, which
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.800]   is a sister blog on AOL.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.760]   And that's got to have stung a little bit.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.320]   Right, Peter?
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.740]   I'm not sure that had anything to do with it, to be honest.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.960]   You don't think so?
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.560]   No, I mean, I think it might have been frustrating.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.700]   But I think that the sheer bureaucracy that there is at AOL,
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.380]   I think that was probably the biggest factor, rather than
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.640]   TechCrunch or anything like that.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.840]   Or how about having to work for Ariana Huffington?
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   I don't think that was a factory.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.840]   That not either.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.440]   We know I asked Joshua last week.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.720]   I said, how's it working for Ariana?
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.240]   He was a little equivocal.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.000]   Well, I mean, technically, as of last week, it hadn't begun.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.640]   Yeah, she hasn't started working there yet.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.560]   Yeah, the deal didn't close until this last week.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.920]   So now, officially.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.880]   But I don't know.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.040]   I mean, I think Engadget's going to do fine under Ariana.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.120]   It doesn't hurt Engadget.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.840]   No, I don't think so.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.480]   Really?
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.920]   You agree, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.320]   Yeah, I do.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.680]   And there's a lot of controversy about the AOL way, which
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.720]   was a large PowerPoint that leaks business inside her.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.320]   They're just mechanized the whole thing.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.560]   We've heard about content farms.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.840]   This is the content factory.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.320]   It was AOL basically saying content doesn't matter.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.720]   Just search results.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.280]   Here's how many pieces you got to do.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.200]   Here's how long they have to be.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.080]   Here's how much traffic you have to get.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.920]   I interviewed Tim Armstrong at CUNY, my university this week.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.960]   And I asked him about this.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.520]   I said, is the AOL way now the Ariana way?
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.320]   And he stood by the AOL way.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.240]   And his argument was-- I'll be curious to hear what you
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.080]   think of this.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.120]   His article was basically that it's
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.200]   just trying to make everybody's job easier
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.080]   because it's more efficient.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.640]   Everybody else has two more things.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.560]   And he's trying to systematize it more for their benefit.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.040]   Well, I mean, whatever you think about that document
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.480]   and the AOL way and what that represents for content,
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.120]   I think it is worth noting that that does not apply to Engadget.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.840]   That kind of thing is never applied to Engadget.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.760]   The way that we set it up when we brought Engadget to AOL
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.960]   was that AOL could never touch Engadget editorially.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.400]   And that holds to today.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.880]   So there's this crap to deal with.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   But not that.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.080]   AOL's never interfered with editorial at all at Engadget.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.000]   And that's not why anyone left.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.920]   Really, I think it's more--
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.840]   But if it were just Joshua or Justin,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.160]   like maybe I would credit that.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.000]   But then both leaving at the same time,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.720]   that seems more significant.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.240]   No?
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.160]   And the startup?
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.400]   I mean, I can't speak for them, ultimately.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.360]   And I think they said their piece on the matter.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.600]   But yeah, I mean, look, it's a grind.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.200]   Blogging like that is a grind.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.720]   It is--
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720]   China's not it.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.920]   I can't even express.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.520]   I mean, you really have no life.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.480]   It's much harder than it looks.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.240]   I had no life until I quit Engadget.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.680]   And even now, I don't have that much of a life.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.360]   They're actually-- they left together.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.560]   So they're going to follow your model with the vowels.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.040]   Exactly.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.520]   What I wonder--
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.680]   This time, so it would start EAE to match your G-game.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.320]   That's possible.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:33.880]   It would be great.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.440]   We actually won the trademark on that.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.240]   I was wondering if maybe they'd contacted you.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.120]   I mean, it sounded like they were going somewhere.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.360]   I mean, we always talk.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.480]   But what we're doing and what Engadget does
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.400]   is very different.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.800]   We're not a new site.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.960]   You're not all about content.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.200]   You're about liking a gadget, reviewing a gadget that--
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.520]   Right.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.520]   Yeah, we're a social web app.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   We're a social web app.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.360]   It's a pretty different experience.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.200]   Right.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.700]   Right.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.120]   Of course, it'd be great if you had a gadget blog
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.240]   to go along with that.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.760]   The world has enough gadget blogs.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.000]   All right.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.840]   All right.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.640]   I don't know.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.720]   It's the kind of thing we all gossip about.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.520]   But it is an interesting shift after this big move
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.400]   with the Huff Po and what AOL's doing.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.480]   It looks a little shaky for AOL to see two of the biggest
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.440]   stars of their blog empire.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.200]   Yeah, but all these sites have turnover.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.880]   I mean, how many editors have--
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.400]   right.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.840]   Has Gizmodo gone through?
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.320]   All right.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.120]   It's natural that it's a very high intensity job,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.800]   being an editor of a top blog, whether it's a tech blog,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.880]   or a non-tech blog.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.120]   It can be a pretty hard job.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.160]   And people burn out.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.880]   I mean, that's pretty--
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.440]   Well, Jill, yeah.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.440]   Let's probably burn out.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.940]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.280]   People burn out.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:44.640]   OK.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.360]   People burn out.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:45.880]   I'm tired.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.440]   I'm out of here.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:46.960]   Just do it.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.480]   Just do it.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:47.980]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.320]   Lately.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.920]   Not everyone has to be honest.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.280]   Right.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.440]   I burned them out.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.840]   No, we didn't burn them out.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.040]   But you know, there are more in the--
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.960]   he's more in the public eye than I think he used to be.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.480]   I mean, he's been on your show quite a lot.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.480]   A lot of credit goes to the Engadget podcast,
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.560]   which is a great podcast.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.060]   That's true.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.120]   I mean, no, I'm not diminishing that by any means
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.560]   that he does amazing there.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.880]   But I think all of that together is kind of putting them more
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.200]   in the public eye than when before they just left.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.560]   And it was no big deal.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.440]   Well, I don't know.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.520]   I think with Ryan, if he were left, people knew that they left.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.560]   That was a big story when they left, frankly.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.800]   Yeah, I mean, it got covered, I guess.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.040]   But we didn't leave because we hated AOL.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.320]   AOL's an investor in our new company.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.280]   Yeah, it's time to move on.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:29.800]   That's all.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.080]   So we left on really good terms.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.880]   Gina, when you left Life Hacker, was it like a sigh of relief?
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.920]   Like, oh, God.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.840]   It's a tough job, just like these guys say.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.240]   And you get to a point where you just like, you know,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.840]   I love this job and I love this site.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.680]   But I just need to move on and do a different thing
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.200]   and have a different lifestyle.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.240]   It really is a grind.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.920]   And I imagine I was pretty removed from this.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.000]   But I mean, I think it seems like Engadget kind of maintained
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.400]   there's going to small scrappy startup even being within AOL.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.680]   And you know, things happen.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.040]   And then you just get to a point where you're like,
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.880]   I want to do something new.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.720]   I wouldn't be surprised if that was the whole story
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.960]   and not the sound of stuff.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.800]   So disappointed.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.320]   All right.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:02.800]   Sorry.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   Who manufactures some dirt?
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.680]   Moving on.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.040]   iPad 2, show of hands.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.520]   How many of you got in line at the pop-up store?
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:08.960]   One?
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.840]   Well, you have to.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.680]   No, I did not at the pop-up.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.280]   Or anywhere.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.320]   Where'd you get yours?
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.200]   I got mine from Apple.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.040]   Oh, you got a loaner.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.160]   You're going to send that back, though?
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:16.760]   Maybe.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.120]   Oh, all right.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.360]   They will find you.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.040]   I was going to eat crow.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.600]   I was going to get one before the show.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.720]   This is sold out.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.880]   This is the man who very famously
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.440]   reboxed his iPad 1, disappointed with it.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.400]   He has a Samsung Galaxy tab.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.360]   I love that right here.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.480]   It was a great device.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.480]   Great device.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   It's not a case.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   No, I like it.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.000]   It's a smart phone.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.160]   I think I got--
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.040]   Where'd you get the case?
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.440]   That dark sun.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.680]   Where'd you get the case?
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.080]   Oh, just Best Buy.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.920]   So they actually sell cases for--
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.120]   It's not a magical case.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.760]   It doesn't--
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.520]   It's a revolution.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.600]   I'm a diabetic.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   And it's a collapsed--
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.280]   --and Harry Potterberg.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:50.800]   No.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.440]   Lisa Bettany, you have one with a magical revolutionary case.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.080]   You almost have to buy that.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.760]   It's kind of like--
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.040]   I think it's Steve Jobs' retirement plan, like the $29 profit
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.720]   in that case.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   Also, it's not a case.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.320]   It's just a cover.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.240]   Not even a case.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.160]   Just a cover.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:07.640]   The back is--
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.720]   They don't call it a case.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.120]   They call it a smart cover.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.480]   Oh, he's doing this information.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.720]   It's a call on when you open it.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.960]   Lillio, do the senior wetsus.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.560]   I love when you do the senior wetsus.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.080]   OK, so--
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.360]   Hey, bababoo, you sadite?
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.280]   Sadite.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.480]   It talks to you when you turn it on.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.560]   You know, Blackberry did that 20 years ago.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.840]   I mean, it's been around for some time, hasn't it?
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.840]   I mean, it's not--
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.840]   But it's different when Apple does it.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   It's different when Apple does it.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.840]   But it's different when Apple does it.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.840]   It's different.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.840]   It's different.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   It's magical.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.840]   When Apple--
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.160]   Pay no attention to those droids.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.600]   Well, all right, so you didn't get one beer attending?
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.120]   Nah.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.960]   They're sold out for you.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   I have a first one.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.640]   I'm going to hold that until something else.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.400]   You know, I was told by a very reliable source, a person
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   standing next to the Apple store, that they--
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.240]   Well, I believed it.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.440]   Someone close to Apple.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   Someone close to Apple.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   The story will read.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.360]   The story will be published on the new blog run by the Apple
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.360]   office.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.360]   She was standing right there.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360]   Yeah, no.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.720]   She said there are only two stores with this many iPad 2s,
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.000]   the Fifth Avenue store and the pop-up store in South by--
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.760]   and you know, there was still a line this morning.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.160]   And every other store is sold out.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   So I believe--
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.320]   Mid-morning, the last thing they had was white 64 gig Wi-Fi only.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.440]   Who would buy that?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.440]   699.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   That-- I think I sold that.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:21.940]   Somebody?
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.000]   All the Apple guys were standing outside with their hands
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.080]   and their pockets, so I can buy now.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.280]   Now what happens to a little bit?
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.040]   What up, store when it sells all his stock?
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.240]   Does it deflate?
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.520]   Well, you can still go in and touch it.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.240]   And it's had fun in it.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.040]   And wonder at it.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.200]   And they'll take your order, I'm sure, right?
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.880]   Two to three weeks now on the Apple website.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.320]   Three to four.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.320]   Three to four?
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.320]   It's going up every--
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   They just said it's a three to four already?
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.520]   You know, a couple of hours.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.160]   I don't know, but I'm really excited about it.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.200]   I mean, obviously having a camera in there for me is--
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.560]   Well, you're a photographer, but come on.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   It's a crappy camera.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.560]   It's a real bad camera.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.920]   It's a crappy camera, but it's there.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.680]   You know, it's the first step towards something bigger.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.240]   Come on, now.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.960]   You're walking down the street.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.160]   Something interesting happens.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.320]   You're going to pull out your iPhone.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.120]   You're going to pull out your camera.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.000]   Or you're going to pull out your iPad.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.920]   This thing is too big.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.200]   The Galaxy Tab over there is way easier to pull out
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.800]   and deal with.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.600]   Yeah, Jeff, you have a gadget, right?
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.080]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.800]   Have you ever taken any pictures with that?
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.480]   Jeff?
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.840]   I have no talent, so they're all happy.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.640]   I was surprised.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.800]   Apple did not put a great camera in this.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.640]   It seemed like they anticipated--
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.160]   This should be put on to be terrible.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.720]   It's bad.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.240]   It's so bad.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.360]   Why do they put such a crappy camera in there?
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.440]   Because they can sell you a new one next year.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.880]   Because they knew you'd buy it.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.560]   What does Apple do?
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.200]   Anything.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.960]   Oh, it's a profit deal.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.680]   They could get away with--
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.680]   They got away with putting a crappy camera in there.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.200]   Who's going to stop?
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.800]   What are you going to do?
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.560]   Not buy one?
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.720]   It does feel like Apple didn't go as far as they could in this.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.880]   That they just went a little bit improved.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.840]   So there's a little room.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.240]   It's like me crowd surfing.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.400]   You hold back just a little bit
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.720]   so that you have something for next year.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.640]   Is that what happened?
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.800]   Well, I actually think that maybe they made the first one
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.360]   a little thicker than it needed to be.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.960]   Just so they can get a second one.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.640]   Well, if you actually open up the first one,
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.680]   there is a little bit of extra room in that case.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.720]   Whoa, that's a good conspiracy theory.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.160]   It's almost as if they planned it from the beginning.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   I know.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.520]   If they've got some kind of strategy in mind
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.480]   to take your money repeatedly--
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.440]   Here's what I've been saying.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.160]   I've been saying, if you have an iPad,
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.920]   one feel no need to upgrade, unless you, for some reason,
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.480]   you have to have a camera, a crappy camera, or thinness
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.200]   matters so much.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.520]   But we have to understand that a lot of people
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.560]   use these devices.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.480]   Like families use them to FaceTime each other
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.520]   and to use it as--
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.760]   And that's something that a camera would be--
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.040]   I guess if you really wanted to FaceTime.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.480]   Yeah, or Skype, or--
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.680]   I mean, that's something that I use all the time.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.920]   But you think you'll use it on that?
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.960]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.480]   All right.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.920]   Can I ask the crowd, how many of you actually
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.000]   do FaceTime use it?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.120]   See, I'm with you, Kelly.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:46.640]   I don't believe--
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.720]   I use not many.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.080]   But I just don't believe people do it,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.080]   but actually it's more than I even would thought.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.440]   I thought one person would raise their hand.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.000]   I use it one--
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.920]   How many people do you believe?
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.160]   Not Skype, FaceTime.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.240]   When you travel.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.680]   And you use it instead of Skype?
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.880]   Why instead of Skype?
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.240]   It's easier to talk to your wife,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.600]   because she doesn't have to know how to use Skype.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.360]   It's on her phone.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.280]   It's just a phone call.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.080]   That's what they do?
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.880]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.480]   That's what they do.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.240]   That's how they get you.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.760]   That's what they do.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.320]   First, this starts with ease of use.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.360]   Then what?
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.600]   Well, bad places.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.040]   I've seen the roadmap.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.440]   Your deal in Skype before--
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.480]   Year 12?
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.240]   Total disaster.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.920]   I was just going to reassure all the people with iPad 1s
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.000]   that you don't have to feel bad.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.640]   You didn't get one.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.120]   But I guess--
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.680]   Nah, definitely.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.360]   I guess you should feel bad.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.680]   There was a big aftermarket already on resale.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.520]   Who's our sponsor?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.560]   Hubbard.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.120]   Yeah, them.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.640]   Gazelle.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.120]   Gazelle.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.640]   Thank you.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.240]   The audience knows our sponsor's better than I do.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.320]   That means it's really working.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.160]   That's good news, Leo.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.560]   That's very good news.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.240]   No reminding you of Google's sponsors.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.160]   You won't notice that.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:50.840]   Yeah, you watch it.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.320]   I never watched my own show.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.840]   It's like 300 bucks or 400 bucks, right?
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.240]   But they're doing a fast market.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.640]   They did a lot of iPad 1s sales right off the bat.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.680]   Right.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.320]   And you can't get an iPad 1s still in some stores
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.560]   for 100 bucks less if they're still in stock.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.120]   They're not going to make them anymore.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.640]   Well, what do the gadget users say?
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   Are they excited about the iPad 2?
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.040]   I think a lot of them are pretty excited.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.920]   They have a lot of the same consternation over whether they
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.720]   should buy a new one if they already have one.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.520]   And we had one guy on the site that started a discussion.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.160]   He was just sort of like, my iPad's obsolete.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.680]   And I was like, well, you can still use it.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.200]   It still works.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.160]   You don't have to throw it away.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.400]   Well, that's Brian Rushman.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.440]   Because he-- Brian's here.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.400]   He got a bad one.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.800]   But there have been some reports that there
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   are some screens that have yellow backlight kind of thing.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.280]   Have your users reported that in any great number?
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.680]   I haven't seen too much on that.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.180]   All right.
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.880]   Now, there's always going to be a little of that.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.680]   It's pretty money-bound.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.180]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.960]   There's definitely like, you're never
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.560]   going to get something where it's manufactured, first run,
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.840]   hundreds of thousands of units, and not a single one
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.360]   has an issue.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.200]   How many you think they sold?
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.160]   How many?
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.280]   Have they sold?
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.600]   It's got to be hundreds of thousands.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.080]   I mean--
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.580]   Millions.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:01.680]   It's probably--
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.360]   It's probably $1 million.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.000]   It's got to be $1 million.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.680]   What's that $1 million?
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.480]   I think they're probably sold.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.320]   They sold $1 million for a high-end--
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.000]   It's entirely possible.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.640]   --like $1 million.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.560]   They got to have sold at least that many.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.440]   The lines that I've seen were longer than iPhone 4.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.360]   And iPhone 4 lines with the longest Apple has ever had
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.120]   for a launch.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.600]   Well, don't--
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.320]   --it's where we are.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.480]   No, I don't mean here.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.360]   I mean, just in general, across the country,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:20.840]   the lines have been--
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.520]   The lines are pretty long in New York, too.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:27.360]   You know, I saw some reports that they expect Apple to get
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.920]   $1 million within a couple weeks, as opposed to the 28 days
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.800]   that it took last year to get to a million sold.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.840]   And I just find it funny, because last year we were all
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.200]   like-- it only took you 28 days to get to a million.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.520]   And now this year we're going to be 28 days.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.120]   They have to feel like they must have made a million of them.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.320]   They can't have just made a few hundred thousand.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.040]   I think the really interesting thing here
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.400]   is not how many they sold, but how few everybody else
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.680]   is selling, and how these guys are just owning it.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.800]   How soon do we know?
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.600]   Do we know?
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.360]   Not doing very well.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:18:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.840]   If they were doing well, they would
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.120]   be talking about how well they're doing it.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:02.480]   They're not.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.280]   They sold 10.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.320]   It was great.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:04.840]   I have one.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.600]   They rushed it out.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.160]   Interesting.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.640]   I mean, I remember when we were all sitting here at CES,
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.640]   and everyone's talking about tablets,
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.280]   and how excited everyone was.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.240]   And then I said, OK, wait for what?
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.440]   To see what Apple does.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:17.940]   Right.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.040]   You were right.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.680]   Well, the Zoom was best of show at CES.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.280]   Most people--
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.120]   You know why?
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.840]   Because the iPad 2 wasn't there.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.520]   I mean, it's nice.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.120]   And there's some nice things about Honeycomb.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.240]   I actually think the browser is really good.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.600]   I think that the dedicated Gmail app is really nice.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.520]   And if you use Gmail, I've never been particularly
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.960]   happy using Gmail on the iPad.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.520]   I'm the best, yeah.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.160]   I'm the best, yeah.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.480]   But Honeycomb was rushed out.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.880]   The SDK was just released a few weeks ago.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.640]   And there's the selection of apps.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.600]   It's just not there yet.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.000]   What about the Samsung 10.1 they've announced?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.320]   That's going right after iPad, isn't it?
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.280]   It'll basically be like the Zoom.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.040]   It's going to be right here.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.480]   It's another Zoom as well, yeah.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.520]   You know, the interesting kind of dark horse
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.720]   is the Blackberry, the playbook.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.160]   I'm not very-- I wasn't very--
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.560]   I like--
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.360]   I think the real dark horse is the HP touchpad.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.720]   That one actually looks really good.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.880]   So the playbook is what, a couple months off?
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.160]   I think it'll be out in a few weeks.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.840]   Yeah, a few weeks.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.320]   And when does the HP come out?
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.560]   We'll have it at our event tomorrow.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.040]   Where are you at?
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.200]   Tell us about it.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:18.640]   Tell us about it.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.920]   Actually, we'll have both.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.000]   We'll have the HP touchpad and the playbook.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.160]   So they're both close to releasing.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.200]   Yeah, they're both-- I think they're
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.480]   both might come out next month.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.600]   Where's your event?
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.560]   It's at the pure volume house loft or whatever.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.720]   Fifth Intrinity tomorrow night.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.000]   Seven o'clock.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Everybody go.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.880]   Open to the public.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.680]   Open to the public.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.920]   If you're in Austin--
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.320]   Yeah, if you're in Austin.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.080]   Peter and-- and, Ryan, I really
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.040]   want to thank you for being here.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   I know you got to get going, so I appreciate it.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.360]   Jeff, do you have to get going?
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.680]   Can you stick around a little bit longer?
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.840]   Baratonic, can you stick around?
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.800]   Yeah, it's the more time for you.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.960]   Please, I beg of you.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.720]   Callie Lewis, I know you have to go to.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.600]   I have to go soon.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.120]   I can stick around.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.080]   Keep feet.tv.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.240]   Yeah, we got to give you a plug.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.960]   And of course, Lisa, you're not going anywhere.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.920]   Because we're going to crowd-serve
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.840]   at the end of this event.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.480]   That's a terrible idea.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.840]   I'm going along the record.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   That is a bad idea.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.280]   Someone's getting hurt.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.360]   Yeah, I've got to tell you a little bit about Go To Meaning.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.240]   Our friends from Citrix are here.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.240]   Is Michael in the house?
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.000]   Michael Guanyari?
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.440]   Is he here?
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.040]   I was sitting somewhere in the back.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.480]   They are such great people.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.160]   Now, there's Michael.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.240]   There's Michael.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.800]   I was just going to tell him about Go To Meaning.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.920]   Works great on the iPad.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.760]   You've got Go To My Peasy.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.880]   You don't have to say anything.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.400]   Just stand there and look pretty.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.360]   Yeah, his mouth is full.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.320]   He's actually--
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.080]   He's actually eating.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.480]   This is your ad, dude.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.480]   You paid for this ad, man.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.920]   Go To Meaning is--
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.600]   I use it, actually.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.880]   We use it all the time in the office.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.800]   We don't have to do an ad for it because we know how good it is.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.680]   We love it.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.920]   It saves time.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.640]   It saves money.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.800]   It saves you stress for business travel.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.560]   Look, if I had to fly to all my meetings,
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.160]   I would not be here.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.600]   I'd be flying somewhere right now.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.360]   Fortunately, Go To Meaning, especially on the iPad,
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.440]   is truly awesome.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.680]   I can hold meetings online for sales presentations,
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.800]   for product demos, for training sessions,
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.120]   collaborating on documents.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.840]   It's about any kind of conference call from my friends
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.400]   at Citrix.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.600]   I always say your name when you eat something.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.360]   Just keep biting.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.840]   $49 a month as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.360]   And it does include free voiceover, internet, and telephone
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.520]   teleconferencing.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.320]   Now here's what you do.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.160]   You go to gotomeeting.com and use a promo code TWIT.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.960]   And it's 30 days free, right, Mike?
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.400]   That's right.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.120]   30 days free.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.360]   Go to meeting.com, promo code TWIT.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.240]   And one of the things I'm really happy about with our friends
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.160]   at Citrix is they realize that the key to getting
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.240]   an intelligent geek audience to use the product
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.760]   is to let you try it.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.480]   They're really willing to put their butt on the line
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.080]   and say, all right, we're not going to sell you on anything.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.440]   Just try it free for 30 days.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.360]   If you like it, it's yours.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:52.880]   You buy it.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.680]   If not, no hard feelings.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.920]   That means they believe in their product
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.400]   and they believe in you.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   That they're not trying to put pull one over on you.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.160]   They believe in you.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.760]   And they know if you see something you like that you will buy it.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.040]   And so we just really thank them for all their support, Michael.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.320]   We really appreciate it.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.720]   Go to meeting.com offer code TWIT.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.880]   Now you were all supposed to leave during that.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.000]   No, you don't have to go.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.840]   You can stay.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.880]   But you guys, if you want to go, you can go.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.680]   How long are we going?
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.520]   We got more people.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.360]   Why don't you take our--
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:21.360]   All right.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   Thank you.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   I really--
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.360]   Thank you so much.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.360]   Wow.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.160]   Brian, Peter, and the floor.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.360]   Don't let that door hit you on the way out, guys.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.360]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   No, no.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.360]   It's all right.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.520]   Nice to see you, Kelly.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.200]   Thank you so much.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   Happy Lewis.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   Happy Lewis.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:52.120]   Happy
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.120]   Lewis.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.000]   Tom and Sarah are actually our hosts on TNT.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.360]   It's great to have you.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.960]   And also, Brian Rushwood, who is a native Estonian.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   Austonian, yes.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.040]   Is that how they say it?
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.240]   Well, you said Estonian.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.560]   I don't think I'm from Estonia.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.400]   I'm a Estonian, too.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   I was like, really?
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.920]   That would be T2-T2, fan of the show.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.720]   The Estonian, Brian Rushwood.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   Justin is here, right?
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.000]   Justin Robert Young, is he here?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.320]   I don't know if he's here in the building.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.680]   Justin Robert Young, you around here?
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   Get on over here if you are.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.240]   I'm getting a lot of heat on the Twitter.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.640]   Well, Brian.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.960]   For shutting him last night, I didn't even recognize him.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.720]   Oh, dude, it was chaos last night.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   You shouldn't do it.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   You should follow anyone last night.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   I shunned him.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   No, I'm not.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.200]   I'm not going to worry about it.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.160]   Hey, is there any news to talk about Tom Merritt?
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.680]   What were you talking about on TNT today?
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.600]   Well, we were talking about Topolsky.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.840]   That's a big story, but apparently nothing to say here.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.200]   What about the Twitter?
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.640]   We were talking about the two Twitter decisions, the one
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.680]   about the developers, where the folks there, you know,
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.840]   staying were changing the API.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.240]   Twitter wants control back.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   Let's start with that one.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.880]   Twitter's telling people, don't write third party
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.880]   applications anymore.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   We want to--
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.320]   Well, it's a little strongly worded.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.920]   They want third party applications, but not that duplicate
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.360]   anything they already have.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.320]   Which is everything.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.800]   They're sort of pulling the rug out there like--
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.160]   Well, they also don't want anything that confused--
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.400]   Well, Brian had a really good perspective on this,
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.480]   because Brian's got an application that would take
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.320]   advantage of Twitter that he wants to use.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.120]   The whole afterlife.me project, the whole idea of tweeting
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.280]   after you're dead, is going to rely very heavily on our
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.920]   ability to access the Twitter API.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.240]   And if they're all of a sudden-- now, granted, they're not
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.880]   saying that they're going to yank the plug on the type of
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.320]   thing we're doing, but now that they have a history of
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.040]   changing all the rules out of nowhere, it sort of has a
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.400]   chilling effect on my interest on developing a new
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.760]   application, taking advantage of the API.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.240]   I don't think they're changing rules, though, right?
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.000]   They're just saying to developers, if you're going to
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.200]   start building a Twitter app, just don't build a client.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.880]   That just does what the standard Twitter client does,
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.760]   which is good advice for the developer.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.040]   Why does that change the rules?
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040]   What if you do a better one?
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.520]   Why don't you do a better job than Twitter or anyone else
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.400]   has done?
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.560]   Which we've already seen before.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.320]   So much of Twitter's success has been completely organic.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.440]   We were talking about, during tech news today, how the
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.120]   at-reply was not created by Twitter.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.320]   It was created by the companies.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:03.680]   Right, right.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.280]   About the retweet was created by the tech.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.600]   But they want developers to innovate more creative ways
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.120]   than just--
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.160]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.920]   I feel like the crowd creates the video.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.440]   Twitter made its bones here at South by South West in
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.640]   2007.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.840]   One of the things that made Twitter was that they had a
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.120]   strong API.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:18.640]   Exactly.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.200]   And they encouraged people to develop third party apps for
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.800]   Twitter when they couldn't.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.840]   So they're dumping them.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.000]   They're pulling up the ropes.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.160]   They're saying--
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.400]   At full disclosure, as I have a nano investment, Bill Gross's
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.600]   Uber Media, and he spooked him, I think, by buying up 20% of
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.160]   Twitter traffic in clients.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.280]   But there are all kinds of new things you can do with
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.040]   Twitter clients.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.200]   But I want to see done.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.160]   Bill Gross owns 20% of all the Twitter clients?
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   Of all the traffic through Twitter clients.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.600]   What clients is it?
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.600]   It's about to buy Tweet Deck.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.360]   He has Echo Phone.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.320]   He has.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.560]   I should know this, but I forget the others.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.560]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.120]   So do you think that that's what this is in response to?
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.760]   Well, that's why they cut off his clients because they were
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.560]   inviolational at that.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.560]   But he's talking to them.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.920]   He wants to work with them.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.040]   I don't speak for him or his company at all.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.560]   But no reason it can't be a friendly relationship.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.400]   But that may spoke to--
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.120]   Spook him a little bit.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.560]   I don't know.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.120]   But there is innovation to be had even in the clients.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.200]   Yes, definitely.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.160]   Twitter wants developers to do something new that they're
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:16.680]   not doing.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.200]   And he can do that at that point.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.840]   When Facebook brought out its platform, it killed its own
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.040]   apps like Courses, which my son then built.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.920]   And they said, the public's going to do a better job.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.360]   Developers will do a better job than staff will.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.320]   Now Twitter, which grew through this kind of development, is
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.200]   now turned around.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.760]   I just think it's a--
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.560]   It's an--
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.920]   Here's-- well, here's--
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.320]   So here's another perspective, one in one.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.920]   I don't think they've completely turned around.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.720]   I think they've recognized the benefit.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.920]   They're trying to manage it.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.160]   They've got this big beast.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.040]   They're huge now.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.960]   People are giving them millions of dollars.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.360]   They're doing award shows.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.760]   And from the perspective--
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.080]   Twitter sells now.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.280]   They sell promoted accounts.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.720]   They sell promoted trends.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.280]   They sell recommendations.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.640]   I'm not recognizing an algorithm, but they sell products
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.040]   that someone buys with the expectation they're going to
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.600]   reach a Twitter user.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.680]   And until very recently, that only worked on Twitter.com.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.640]   Now what works in the Twitter official mobile app for
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.280]   Android and for iPhone and for iPad.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.680]   So the addressable audience, if you buy something from
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.160]   Twitter, gets bigger.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.720]   If you have some other client out there that's not a part of
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.400]   the Twitter sanctioned client system, then not going to
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:22.960]   see the app.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.280]   Well, this goes to Dave Weiner's point.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.240]   It's like having another cable company just to be off
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.400]   the side and not carrying the ad.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.760]   This goes to Dave Weiner's point that we're stuck with
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.520]   them and we should create a federated shadow to Twitter.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:33.920]   I agree.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.160]   Because we are--
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.360]   They got us right here.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.160]   And they're not selling your own--
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.400]   They're not cutting off all the developers.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:40.900]   No.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.160]   They're saying the tweet decks, the season--
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:42.520]   Just the core client.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.280]   They can keep going.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.600]   They're grandfathered in.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.320]   They're just saying, we have enough.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.920]   They're starting to be too much confusion.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   No.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.640]   That's what they're saying.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.320]   That's what they're saying.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.800]   They're saying, if you don't have the dick bar, you're
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.760]   taking money out of my pocket.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.440]   But tweet deck doesn't have to have the dick bar.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.680]   I think they would love all those to go away.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.600]   I mean, I think really what they want to do is just as you
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.680]   said, Beritunde, if you don't have the promoted tweets, if
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.240]   you don't have the dick bar, if you don't have all the
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   things we make money on, we don't want you to tick away.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.120]   That's what supports them.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.600]   If you're NBC and you buy a promoted tweet and 20% of
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.520]   your users will see other clients, then what did you
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.160]   really buy?
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.280]   And do you need to get a discount?
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.640]   This is the problem of not having your
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.040]   business model first.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.600]   That's really interesting.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.360]   And then the user interface, having a uniform experience, I
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.960]   think they actually do care about that.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.720]   Is this going to be the way startups work from now on
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.680]   where they grow, they scale based on the support of the
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.560]   community, but they don't have a Facebook kind of similar
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.280]   situation.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.480]   They grew because they made certain promises, but then when
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.120]   they came time to make money, they say, well, screw you,
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.200]   we're going to do it our way.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.480]   Because we need to make money.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.600]   That's the way everything's been.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.720]   That's the way television's been.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.400]   Radio's been.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.960]   Anything in its infancy, when there is no market, when
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.560]   there is nobody following, you do whatever you think is
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.040]   going to get you attention to make you money, which includes
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.320]   a lot of things that we're doing right here on Twitch.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.720]   We play fast and loose with a lot of some of the small
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   things that technically are copyright violations.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   Laws.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.200]   But meanwhile, we're watching the entire face of media
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:11.800]   change.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   And the CCs.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   Exactly.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.440]   But we could do that now because we're young.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.720]   And when there's a point, when there's a significant amount
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.120]   of money involved, when there's a significant amount of
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.200]   monetary interest, you have to restructure the rules.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.720]   And I'm not blaming them.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.920]   Now, I will say that unfortunately, the Twitter
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.400]   thing seriously has a chilling effect, I think, on
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.640]   developing new content.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.560]   I understand that they're doing the Apple thing of saying,
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.480]   look, don't duplicate functionality that we already
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.400]   have with our apps.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.360]   That's essentially what they're doing right here.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.760]   But what I don't like is the precedent of them having even
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.160]   once changed all the rules right from the beginning.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.600]   But Gina, you're OK with it.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.600]   I'm actually OK with it.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.240]   I don't-- they didn't change the rules.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.880]   Yes, I wrote a Twitter app.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.560]   It's not a Twitter client, though.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.960]   It's an app that does other things with Twitter data, which
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.040]   is what Twitter the company is trying to encourage.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.000]   And they're not killing existing third party apps.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.360]   There's always going to be the non-official Twitter app that
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.760]   most of the people in this one are probably going to use.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.920]   First they came for the Twitter clients.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.120]   And I did not care.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.960]   Because I did not have a Twitter client.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.200]   I'll give you an example.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.120]   When I got the iPad 2, Andrew Stone, who writes "Twittle
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.480]   Later," sent me a note saying, you've got to try it.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.880]   We can now tweet a video directly from "Twittle Later."
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.840]   That's a nice feature.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.360]   You know, he doesn't have it in their client.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.800]   Is it OK for him to do that?
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.720]   Because it's not a feature that they already have.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.960]   I mean, I think that's something--
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.080]   Yeah, that's an extra feature that you want.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.440]   I mean, multiple accounts, that kind of thing.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.520]   But you know, listen, most people--
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.480]   most Twitter users, mainstream Twitter users
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:43.760]   are using their official client.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.520]   But I think the market for third party apps
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.160]   is for advanced users who want to manage six accounts,
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:48.640]   and that kind of thing.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.000]   And they're not killing those.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.120]   And you know, Ryan's email to the developer list,
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.360]   it went out late on a Friday.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.600]   It seemed kind of shady.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.760]   But I mean, the way he wrote it was,
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.960]   when a developer asks is a good thing to build for Twitter
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.520]   a client app, the answer is no right now.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.120]   Right now, starting to build a Twitter client that
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.120]   just lets you tweet and get tweets as a bad idea.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.960]   Yes, obvious.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.440]   You're a guy that Fred Wilson said that himself, right?
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:12.960]   He did.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.160]   I think this is an example of a very young new way
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.240]   of doing business having its stumbling point, right?
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.720]   It's not that the message is wrong.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.080]   If you're going to crowdsource and you're
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.920]   going to do this, eventually you're going to mature,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.600]   and you're going to want to consolidate,
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.360]   you're going to want to say, we want retweet
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.760]   to work the same across everything.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.720]   We want less confusion.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.520]   We want to be able to sell the ads.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.240]   And there's a way to do that elegantly.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.080]   And Twitter is just stumbling a bit.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:35.880]   You can get a message out.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.200]   It comes off in elegantly.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.760]   It comes off kind of churlish.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   But it's a classic case of channel conflict, right?
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.320]   And as all startups do go through,
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   is you think this is your world, and you suddenly realize,
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.400]   no, that's my world, so I don't want anybody else in that.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.120]   Look at Amazon is big enough that it
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.680]   can afford to publish books competing with the publishers who
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.160]   now hate Amazon.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.200]   But they can do it.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.080]   But they could do it.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.880]   Big enough that it can start to say, no, no, no, no, that's ours.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.720]   It's the same way people feel about their bands, right?
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.240]   Band start getting more successful.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.720]   They start changing the way they do business.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.220]   Sellouts.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.920]   And it's like, I loved you when you were poor.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.480]   It's basically what people say.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   When you were mine.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.280]   When you were mine, when no one knew about you,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.480]   when you're eating ramen, when you smelled like bad things,
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.200]   that's when you did best.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:21.520]   Tim Wu, in his book, what is it, The Infirmate?
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.600]   The Kill Switch talks about this.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.280]   He says, the free and open internet
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.960]   isn't going to stay free and open for that exact reason.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.520]   It was free and open so it could reach critical mass.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.640]   But these things never stay free and open.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.440]   He said, just look at history time and time again, free and open.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.360]   It's a cycle.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.960]   Open, closed, open, closed.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.440]   Open, closed.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.160]   He says the internet's going to be closed.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.000]   That's our big issue.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.240]   It is not a public internet.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.200]   This is why I keep harping on the idea that we have to have--
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.440]   we, the people of the internet, sounds nice.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.120]   Ooh, a competition.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.360]   We have to have principles so that we
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.960]   can hold companies and governments' feet to the fire
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.680]   to say you're violating those principles.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.920]   And we aren't doing that.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.200]   We're just kind of going along.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.800]   And as Gina taught me, hackers hack around.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.840]   And it's OK.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.040]   But then at some point, boom.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.880]   We're not going to be able to do the things on the internet
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.160]   that we want to do.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.200]   And we're going to have ourselves to blame too,
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.160]   because we didn't stand up and determine what was right
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.040]   about the internet and fight to keep it that way.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.800]   Are you going to secede from the internet?
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.400]   Right on.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:19.920]   Right on.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.960]   Who internet?
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.640]   I'm running for president this fall.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.960]   Who internet?
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.480]   Of the internet.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.080]   No, I think Baradudah, you said something
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:27.800]   have joking here.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.960]   Are you going to secede from the internet?
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.880]   But isn't that the solution is when the internet's
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.840]   starting to get closed.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.640]   You secede and you go to a different data communication
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.000]   transfer way of transmitting.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.480]   And you find a way to get the signal out around.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.400]   Well, and this is actually--
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:40.760]   What is that?
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   You're hackarithmic.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.880]   Yeah, that's so hard.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.880]   This is one of those things where for much as Baradudah
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.520]   and I go back and forth, obviously,
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.160]   with you for more left-leaning perspective
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.400]   and me from a libertarian perspective,
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.480]   it's like I want the greatest amount of freedom
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.720]   for the greatest amount of people.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.840]   And I get an argument with very intelligent people,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.240]   for example, my friend Andrew Maine, who's just not
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.400]   bothered by a bunch of the encroaching government
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.440]   control of things because he says technology will advance
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.240]   faster than government regulation will advance.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.400]   So you will continue to get increased freedom,
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.600]   even though technically the letter of the law
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.120]   is getting more and more red tape as far as you can see.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.800]   And we don't know what the internet is yet.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   Pardon me for this, but in Gutenberg years, it's 1465.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.280]   It's 15 years after the brain press is invented.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.080]   And just after porn was printed.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.560]   Yes.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.680]   Oh, those woodcuts.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.240]   That's right.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.920]   I think it's important to remember, though, that Twitter
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.080]   is not the internet.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.960]   It's a company that has data that it uses, that it sells,
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:35.960]   that tries to make money on.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.720]   It's not the internet.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.240]   Somebody said Facebook is the internet.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:38.740]   Right.
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.800]   Facebook is the internet.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.240]   That's Twitter is not the internet.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.160]   Well, I'll draw Zarellaine.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.880]   The Facebook-- we mentioned Facebook earlier,
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.760]   that back in the day, Facebook got a lot of popularity,
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.560]   in part because of the apps that people were making on the platform.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.200]   And then they changed the rules and upset people.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.000]   Facebook also has a history of buying companies
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.240]   for the talent of companies that do good things that they
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.280]   want to incorporate into their system.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.720]   I see Twitter doing the same thing.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.480]   Twitter is now in the business to make money.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.760]   People have been asking for years,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.000]   how is Twitter going to make money?
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.640]   Well, they've shown clearly that they're
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.920]   intending to make money.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.320]   They don't want people competing with them.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.120]   They're going to take any money away from them.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.720]   And I see them buying companies and talent that
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.440]   can help further their platform in a similar way.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:18.960]   Done.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.160]   Easy time to create a public Twitter.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.600]   Open source Twitter.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.800]   Well, a federated Twitter.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.840]   Open source federated Twitter, where you're not bound.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.560]   Every day, where has been screaming it?
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.880]   But Evan already did it.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.640]   He did identical.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.720]   Didn't take off.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.280]   Right.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.440]   How do you make it take off?
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.200]   What do you do?
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.920]   What do you make a public Twitter do that's different?
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.800]   You have to get the hip people to use it.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.520]   I mean, that's the thing is if there's
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.520]   one environment where people will very quickly switch
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.440]   to a better alternative.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.080]   It's on the internet.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.680]   We've been trained-- I mean, how many generations
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.000]   of social media--
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.360]   Except that the network effect is really critical.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.000]   So the internet also supports monopolies.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.360]   Because if all your friends are on aim,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.760]   or all your friends are on Facebook,
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.120]   or all your friends are on Twitter,
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.840]   it's very hard-- or all your searches are on Google,
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.120]   it's very hard to move.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.760]   So there is a tendency to monopoly as well.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.480]   No, that's a good point.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.200]   Because right now, if you've got friends on MSN, on AOL,
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.840]   and all your different instant message, or clients,
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.680]   you can use Trillion that does all of them.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.800]   But if Twitter is saying no more duplicating our functionality,
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.880]   then we have a problem.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.520]   If one day Facebook is the next day--
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.760]   One day Facebook is the next day--
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.320]   Sorry, Tom?
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   One day Facebook is the next day's my space.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.880]   Why don't we just go back to my space?
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.320]   Now I don't think so.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.520]   Doesn't it happen that at some point you get so big--
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:33.160]   when you have 650 million users, can somebody take Facebook's
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:33.480]   place?
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.440]   I don't think so.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.400]   No, no, I think Baratoune is on to something.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.520]   I say that my space are the bell bottoms of the internet.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.040]   And I say we all go back to my space now.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.120]   No call it a comeback.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.400]   It's been here for years.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.680]   Screw that freaster guy.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.800]   I had a guy who emailed me, and he blogged that he wants
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.600]   to buy my space and turn it into condos.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.000]   It's not insane there was a talk here at South By
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.120]   about the idea that we don't have the right analogy yet.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.040]   Mark Davis from Microsoft was saying we need a property
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.320]   analogy.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.560]   We don't own any of the internet.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.920]   We don't own anything on the internet.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.960]   We don't own our data.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.800]   We don't own our servers while you do.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.480]   We don't own our pipes.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.240]   We don't own anything on the internet.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.640]   And so how do we get some piece of the internet that we own?
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.520]   And we take it back.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.080]   What do we take?
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.480]   I thought I pitched for it.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.840]   The problem is convincing mainstream users to care
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.640]   about things like Federation and hosting the role.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.840]   I mean, who's going to switch to identical and de-aspora
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.000]   because they feel so strongly?
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.520]   Not yet.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.720]   People are going to switch.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.960]   How much of a unique phenomenon are you using?
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.680]   Could you do something where you still exploit Twitter?
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.440]   I can still--
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.240]   Yes, use Twitter to talk a little bit about the show.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.080]   Don't have Twitter come back with Twitter.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.040]   But then over here, there's a nicer world where, in addition,
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.080]   I can see the videos.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.000]   And I can add this.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.560]   And I can add more than 140 characters.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.480]   And I can do more.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.800]   And you know, truncated for Twitter,
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.440]   you've still cooperate with Twitter.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.800]   You still exploit its API still.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.200]   But you build a parallel universe.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:01.400]   How many companies have tried and failed to do that
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.640]   with Jaiku and Plurk and Pounce?
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.120]   I mean, there's 100 companies that have died on the shows
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:08.560]   of Twitter.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.440]   It's very hard.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.080]   Twitter's very good at what they do.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.440]   And they were very good at leveraging developers
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.000]   into helping them figure out the stuff they did now.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.720]   So this may be the weak chink.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.960]   If developers get upset enough, they
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.240]   may start to leave some of those things open
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.920]   that they would have discovered for Twitter.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.760]   And a competitor could move in and explain it.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   And I would also imagine--
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.320]   This idea--
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.200]   I don't think-- I'm not a complete student of history.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.040]   I don't think we have any historical analogy
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.760]   for something like this, except for the fact
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.840]   that everything eventually dies.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.760]   So the idea that Twitter is going to be Twitter and dominating
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.280]   this thing forever, either something else will come along
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.080]   that is different and better than-- and we'll look back
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.240]   at Twitter and be like, what was that weird thing we did
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.840]   for four years?
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.040]   And then we moved on to the next one.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.600]   I'll tell you what this makes me think of.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.120]   It's almost as though there's an internet environmentalism
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.480]   where there's two different attitudes.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.040]   You can either have the attitude of like,
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.960]   we need to preserve and curate our Twitter
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.680]   so that it's like the way we like it.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   We need to be good stewards of our Twitter
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.760]   because Twitter's the way it should be.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.720]   And then there's another group that's like, hey man,
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.920]   internet change all the time.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.080]   Remember fricking MySpace?
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:09.800]   Whatever.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.920]   Let's bulldoze this business.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.480]   We're point cast networks.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.280]   Yes.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.800]   I mean, who's dominating that space now?
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.600]   It doesn't exist.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.040]   All right.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:17.520]   Apple.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.720]   You said there were two announcements from Twitter.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   Does that cover both of us?
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:20.880]   Well, yeah.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.240]   The other one was the justice in the case about handing over
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.640]   information ruled that because there was no content
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.760]   in the information the government was asking Twitter
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.880]   to hand over, that they had no standing to challenge it.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.000]   Because when I go on to Twitter and I post
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.440]   and I have a session time, I have no expectation of privacy.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.280]   And therefore, the government doesn't need a warrant.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:41.800]   Right.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.280]   They need-- I can't remember the number,
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.920]   but they only need that lesser level of standing
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.040]   to request that information.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.280]   This is the wiretaps.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.880]   Versus pen register issue.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.120]   I've talked about this before.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.240]   In 2007, there were 2,000 wiretaps because you have to get--
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.120]   there's a high standard.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.000]   You have to get a court to approve a wiretap.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.760]   You can't do a phishing expedition.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.880]   You have to say, this is what we're looking for.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.760]   But you can get a pen register because there's
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.120]   no quote content.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.880]   A pen register means subject line to--
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.080]   maybe not subject line.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.280]   There's a debate there.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.720]   It means your GPS coordinates from your cell phone carrier.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.480]   That's not content.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.040]   And as a result, in 2007, when there were 2,000 wiretap requests,
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.760]   there were 8 million pen register requests,
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.160]   all the wireless carriers have set up portals, paid portals
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.080]   for law enforcement.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.240]   You pay a buck or two.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.080]   And I can say, where was Tom Merritt the other night?
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.800]   And it's free and there's no warrant.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.920]   There's no supervision.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.520]   There's no oversight.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.800]   There's no transparency to Tom.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.680]   None at all.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.120]   In fact, there is--
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.280]   Where were you the other night, Tom?
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.680]   There is technical transparency because the Department
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.000]   of Justice by law is supposed to report the number of pen
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.600]   registers every single year.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.440]   They haven't done it in five years.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.480]   They just ignored the law.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.000]   So we don't even know how many there are.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.960]   There are at least sprints said there were 8 million in 2007.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.040]   One carrier.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.000]   So this is something going on all the time.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And that's a very interesting precedent
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.640]   to say there's no content in your tweet.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.920]   We're saying this is a pen register request.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.600]   Since we're not asking for what was in the post,
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.000]   we just want to know when it was sent,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   to whom it was sent, who's in the contact list.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:13.360]   Very serious.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.160]   We can get all the information we need out of that.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   We don't need to know what's--
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.480]   Is a like content?
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.240]   Is it like a function or is it a content?
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:20.760]   No.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.040]   It is a--
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.320]   But it is information.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.960]   But it should be.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.800]   Our actions, our content.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.560]   But that's not the way the government see it,
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.360]   because that's always there.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.920]   I think retweet was in the list of things
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.600]   they asked for that were granted.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.600]   No kidding.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.080]   Just pushing the retweet button.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.240]   Although I got to say, when you--
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.880]   Because it's where you were at the time, they pushed them up.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.240]   Come on.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.160]   When you're tweeting, it's in public.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.040]   I mean, that's the other thing is they can go then
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.240]   take all the information to figure out what was in the post,
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.920]   because the posts are there in public.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.000]   They can use your client.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.840]   Right.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.840]   Is that a plan to DM you as a writer?
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.280]   In other words, they can find out that DMs were sent
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.720]   and to whom they were sent, but not what
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.440]   was in the direct--
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.240]   Which, and that's the part that bugs me the most,
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.880]   because DMs, by their very nature, are meant to be secret.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.400]   They're meant to be private conversation
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.360]   between the two people.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.440]   You did see that the API leaks the DM content.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.080]   Did you see that?
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.040]   Oh, no, I did not.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:08.840]   Yeah, that's another--
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.280]   No, it's not the potential.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.160]   You probably knew that, Gina Trapani.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.000]   It's in the API.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.600]   I didn't know that.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.080]   Does it?
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.680]   Apparently, there's a leak in DM content.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:17.760]   You can see her dialing back.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.840]   Like, what an idea, I'm recently.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   I should be crawling that.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.200]   We're going to take a break.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.320]   Sarah Lane, Tom Merritt, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.400]   Someone's calling him Jake.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.840]   You're looking younger all the time.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.080]   Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani, Verritan de Thurston.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.200]   I'm doing good at this, man.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.520]   This is where Brian Brushwood and Lisa Bettany
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.520]   are on our panel.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.680]   If you want to do a rotate, Eileen, let's do that.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.160]   Anybody who is tired of this?
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.760]   Switch everyone and really mess you up.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.760]   We'll release--
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   Just place somebody's next to us.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.320]   We'll get a bounce.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.440]   I do want to mention, stay here, Brian Brushwood,
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.840]   because I want to talk about Audible.com.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.680]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.760]   I know.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.160]   Anybody else here listen to Audible?
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:52.560]   Come on, come on.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:53.760]   We've got to.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.440]   Oh, I love everybody.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:54.920]   Definitely.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.640]   We love Audible.com.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.920]   How many of you listen to Audible.com?
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.280]   All right.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.400]   So the other half of the audience, we've got to get you.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.560]   We just turn to your neighbor and say, please,
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.720]   listen to Audible.com.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.760]   You just got to take a look at some of the amazing books
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.560]   on Audible.com.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.360]   You got me listening to the Stephen King.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.560]   How far in are you?
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.480]   I'm only on the Wizard and Tower.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.480]   Wizard and Tower.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.480]   Oh, man.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   That big journey's everything.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.080]   Everyone moves.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.800]   Stephen King says New Dark Tower 2012.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.280]   I got to go.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:23.760]   That's right.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.720]   And it takes place between Book 4 and Book 5.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.240]   Oh, man.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.280]   I hate it when he does that.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.800]   Yeah, it's going to go back and fill in a gap.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.120]   OK.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:31.760]   Fill in a gap.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.480]   There was a gap.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:32.960]   All right.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.120]   Between Book-- well, you haven't got there,
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:34.680]   because you haven't got there.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.320]   Yeah, you haven't got there.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.680]   At the end of Book 4, there is a--
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.160]   Nice.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.880]   --tumpt differential.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.360]   Whoa.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:38.880]   Oh, no.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.880]   I'm just saying, boys.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.000]   Some books flow from one book right into the next.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Some books take a break.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   This is a break.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.080]   You can go taking a break.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:47.840]   I'm actually going to--
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.640]   Get out of here, Barry.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   --about 30.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.600]   From the onion, I do a quick promotion.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.320]   I've got my own chocolate bars here.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.320]   What?
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.320]   Yes.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.440]   We're going to put a tight shot on Chocolate Tune Day Bar.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.840]   Are you going to get out of here?
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.840]   Chocolate Tune Day.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.840]   Chocolate Tune Day Bar.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.640]   It looks like I got Juju Bee's buried in there.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.200]   There are cranberries.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.080]   Your crunchy berries today.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.840]   I met this woman who was coming last year, Chopper.com.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.480]   And they will make custom custom chalk for you.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.200]   So she delivered these to me when I arrived.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   Are you going to win this for you?
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.440]   Oh, I was just going to say.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.880]   Share it with the panel.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.160]   Share it with the panel.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:18.920]   Thank you all.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.960]   I love your Baratunde.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.960]   Love you.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.560]   Thank you very much.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.400]   Sarah Sue.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.880]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.880]   We just think the world of Baratunde Thursday is so great,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.400]   so great.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.440]   And now he has his own chocolate.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.480]   When's the book coming out?
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.040]   When's the book coming out?
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.360]   How to be Black, February 2012.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.880]   Do you think there's an irony that he's giving out chocolate bars?
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.680]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.880]   All right, I'm going to pass this around.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.120]   Audible.com here.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   You start it, young lady.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.320]   All women love chocolate, right?
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:48.840]   Am I right?
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.800]   It's Baratunde, Chopper.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.280]   Give it a ton.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.040]   So Audible will give you two free audio books to try out,
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.120]   two credits a month with a platinum plan.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.280]   This is nice, because I tell you one of the things that
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.200]   happens with Audible, is you're already here,
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.080]   is that you talk to somebody who's an Audible fan.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.560]   He says, oh, you've got to listen to this.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.080]   And you've got to listen to this.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.960]   And pretty soon you've got to listen to it as long as you
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:08.920]   are on a book together with you.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.440]   Absolutely.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:09.960]   Absolutely.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.520]   It's one of those things where it's infectious.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.680]   Each little piece of the puzzle, once you get somebody
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.840]   else who's infected with the Audible virus,
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.880]   and what's great is that it's self-building,
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.600]   because it's something that you're super passionate about,
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.720]   you will just bring it up.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.280]   And instantly, it'll remind somebody, oh,
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   but you've got to read this other book in order to understand
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.440]   the context of the first book.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.960]   So what are you reading right now?
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:33.080]   I just finished what might be the goofiest, most apocalyptic
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.000]   book I've ever read.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:34.520]   What's that?
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.400]   The Hunger Games.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.360]   Anyone else read the Hunger Games?
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.000]   Oh, no.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:38.480]   All right.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.040]   One person apparently really likes it.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:40.640]   I like this.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.120]   I like this.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.800]   It is definitely filled with woman porn, by which I mean.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.000]   It's all about a very--
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.240]   it's post-apocalyptic about this girl who
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.960]   goes to a very rich society.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.920]   And half the passages are about how awesome the clothes are
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.840]   and how great the food is.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.360]   But beyond that, I've now moved on to Guns, Germs, and Steel.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.240]   So that's a giant flip of the square.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:02.720]   Yeah, a square diamond.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.640]   That's a great book.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.840]   I think the guy's looking at you as a book or two out on it.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.080]   Yeah, you have books on it.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:07.600]   I remember.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.440]   Why don't you read-- am I on?
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.760]   Turn on his microphone.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.000]   Gary, Gary's banner check is here.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.160]   You don't need a microphone, Gary.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:13.760]   I could just go--
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.080]   Just shout.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:14.920]   I could have freestyle.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.600]   But is he a book on audible.com?
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.720]   I think it is.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.800]   No, I liked to do the audiobook months after the book comes out
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   so I can update it.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.320]   You know, when you're talking about trends--
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.120]   Well, that's a good idea.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.560]   So the audiobook comes out in June.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.000]   Are they trying to get you to read it?
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.720]   You gotta read it.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:30.160]   I will be reading it.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.160]   Oh, you've rushed after--
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.440]   I want to plug the books.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.320]   I haven't had the time to blog it yet.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.920]   But I got the book, Gary sent it to me.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.600]   It was really, really good.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.360]   The great thing is that it's practical advice
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.600]   for businesses, real stories from businesses.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.520]   And the best of all is the real Gary's voice.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.600]   You really come out.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.520]   That's one of the things.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.480]   Well, that's one of the things.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.440]   When it's like one thing, Gary--
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.440]   I think I didn't even know what to agree that one thing, Gary,
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.120]   is not lacking in his passion.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.880]   And that definitely comes across when you read.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.880]   And good looks.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.400]   Well, OK, that's up for the mix.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.320]   Thank you, economy.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.160]   It does look younger than I've ever seen him.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:58.680]   I do.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:47:59.680]   What is it?
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.040]   You look fantastic.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:01.840]   Oh, you shaved.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.840]   Well, all right, there you go.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.200]   You're that easy.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.040]   Go that way and fight.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:04.640]   I'll do it.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.640]   Audible.com.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.560]   I want you to go to Audible.com/twit-two.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.560]   Sign up for the Platinum account.

[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.960]   We've already given you a couple that you
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.080]   might want to think about.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.720]   Currently, I'm reading A Great Biography by David B.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.600]   and Cooley, the TV reviewer for Fresh Air.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.000]   It's on the story of The Smothers Brothers, which
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.640]   is an amazing story of two guys who really broke all the--
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.840]   excuse me, broke all the rules in media.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.080]   Fascinating book.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.920]   But go to Audible.com.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.000]   Pick out two books.

[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.000]   you also get, as with the other plants, free subscription
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.240]   to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times Daily Audio
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.680]   Show, you've got tons of stuff to listen to.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.440]   Can I just say that there's a problem out there with Audible?
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.680]   People are in denial.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.840]   People have a problem.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.800]   And what I mean by that is a lot of people
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.920]   just buy individual books.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.360]   They're like, oh, I'm not one of those.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:49.840]   Subscribe.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.360]   You guys subscribe.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.760]   I'm not one of those subscribing tags.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.280]   I'll just get this one book.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.760]   And then a few weeks later, oh, I'll just get this other book.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.360]   And it's like at some point, you've got to look back.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.000]   You've got to self-assess.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.640]   You've got to realize you were always a subscriber.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.440]   You just need to admit it.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.480]   Come out of the closet.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:04.120]   Subscribe.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:04.760]   Make it official.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.080]   You are always a subscriber.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:06.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.640]   Audible.com/TwitTook off for good in the US and Canada,
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.680]   but Audible's worldwide.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.600]   So check it out.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.280]   Hey, thank you.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.400]   We got a new panelist here.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.360]   Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.280]   It's so great to see you.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.320]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.720]   Wine Library TV.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.560]   Now, last year, you were doing some pouring.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.200]   In fact, that's-- I ran into you last year pouring wine.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   Are you going to do that?
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:26.800]   Or do you already do it?
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.440]   No, no, I'm throwing my secret wine party tonight.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:31.960]   So--
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.000]   You need to talk about the definition of secrets.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.520]   20 cases of wine are with me.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.040]   We're looking for a home.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.240]   Usually every year, I just go to a bar that has nobody in it.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.120]   And I ask them very politely, would you
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.160]   like a lot of people here right now?
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.040]   That's awesome.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.680]   And so tonight, around midnight, I will tweet out a location.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.960]   And then since it's 2011, I'll go on Beluga, group me,
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.240]   Vassaside, Yobongo, and every other platform
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.440]   to tell everybody where it is.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.960]   So I hope you don't get two blitz tonight.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.960]   Don't get too fat.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.480]   Don't get too tired.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.000]   Make sure you're up and about.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.240]   I've got an enormous amount of good wine with me tonight.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.480]   Oh, that's exciting.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.080]   And what is the Twitter handle in case somebody is foolish enough
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.560]   not to be already following Gary Vaynerchuk?
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.640]   Somebody who prides himself in an understanding brand.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.240]   It's actually the worst move of my career,
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.920]   because I have two silent e's in my Twitter handle.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.360]   It's Gary V, G-A-R-Y-V-E-E.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.840]   You regret that now, aren't you, babe?
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.320]   No, I don't regret anything, Leo.
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.280]   I regret nothing.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.560]   He's the idiot of wine.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.440]   So that's great.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.240]   We'll look for that.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.360]   It's good to see everybody in the panel.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.320]   That's my next topic.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.720]   We are at South by Southwest.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.360]   2007, Twitter made its bones here.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.840]   It really became a big thing, because everybody was using it.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.840]   I think it was 2008.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.280]   The four squared took off.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:49.880]   Nine.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.960]   Nine was at nine.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.240]   Last year, Goalak, arguably.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.240]   But this year, you just started a list,
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.520]   and you didn't even finish it.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.840]   There are 20 competitors here.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.840]   Is it possible to rise above the noise at South by Southwest
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.400]   2011?
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.720]   Can you ask the crowd--
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.200]   let's listen.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.000]   What are you using?
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:06.840]   I see what people are using.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.840]   Just say one thing.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.440]   Say the one you're using.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.000]   No, do this.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.560]   How about this?
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.040]   Fight Clap.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.600]   Who's using Group Me?
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.800]   We don't have time to give you a one-way.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.280]   You just Group Me, give me the clap.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.640]   Beluga.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.240]   Three people.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.680]   Fast Society.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.720]   I like Fast Society.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.920]   I think that's the coolest of the bunch.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.680]   You're one other person.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.280]   We're using Fast Society with--
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:25.760]   Nobody.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.760]   Say it.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.760]   That's the problem.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.600]   That's the problem.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.000]   I love it.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.840]   There are a bunch of really great services that are new this year,
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:36.040]   and this is the perfect place to use us all as guinea pigs.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.480]   But they all have--
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.960]   they're overlapping in features.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.680]   There is no critical--
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.720]   There is no one service that's going to rise and be the winner,
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.640]   because they're all doing the same thing.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.080]   I thought actually Beluga had the least interesting features,
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.480]   and yet that's the one we're using.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.200]   And I hear a lot of people using Beluga.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.560]   That seems to be if you're going to pick one about equal,
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.480]   among others, it's that.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.280]   But it's not that strong.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.880]   But we don't really have a good reason.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.560]   We're just using it.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.400]   No, one year actually the reason.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.400]   But we could use Group Me the same way.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.000]   You picked it.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:02.840]   I picked it.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.080]   But that was because it was the first one
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.280]   that I was introduced to.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.080]   And it worked on Android and iOS.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.920]   That was another reason, because Group Me only worked on
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.840]   Android and iOS.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.240]   That's what it was about.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.280]   Fast Society is that it didn't work on Android.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.720]   Yeah, that's iOS only.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.320]   I like that one, my son.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.800]   Group Me seems to be really popular.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.840]   How many of you use Group on?
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.520]   Scurries.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.840]   Group on.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.840]   The coupon.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:23.320]   No, but--
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.400]   Why is it so big?
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.040]   I don't get it.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.000]   Because people like coupons.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.560]   But they don't use it.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.400]   Living social.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.480]   Anybody who's living social?
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.240]   Being social.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:33.600]   You know what?
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.640]   That's bigger than Group on.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.160]   Somebody use the internet.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.160]   [CHEERING]
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.000]   That was making sure here.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.400]   That was a good control group.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.880]   Yeah, well done.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.520]   Scientific method.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.640]   I mean, it's not the end of the world.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.920]   There's certainly bigger stories.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.680]   There seems to be an earthquake in Japan and things.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.000]   But I just find it-- and by the way,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.920]   I've got a number of tweets from people saying,
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.320]   isn't it seem a little self-indulgent to gather in Austin
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.840]   and celebrate the culture of the World Wide Web when horrors
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.720]   are happening overseas in Japan?
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.560]   And when you walk by that CNN bus, CNN has a bus in the grill
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:08.120]   at CNN, and all that's on there monitors is the tsunami.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:08.560]   Is that the--
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.800]   You know, I just got a retweeted.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.240]   Alan Rusper drew the editor of The Guardian
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.480]   who's coming in tomorrow.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.080]   We hope just tweeted a video that is an amateur video that
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.280]   is unbelievable of the tsunami coming in in one town.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.120]   I feel terrible even talking about tech news when really,
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.040]   there's no question that's the only story.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.920]   But there's a story here talking about two
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.200]   that this is where I didn't-- we're in CNN--
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.240]   is that with every big story, something comes of age,
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.280]   supposedly, right?
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.000]   But unlike Haiti, this is a highly connected country
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.320]   where they stayed connected.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.240]   And a few things happen.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.880]   One, I saw people on TV who said that as soon as it happened,
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.800]   people were immediately on this because this is the way
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.360]   to tell them what was going on with friends.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.520]   Not just to work with your friends.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.520]   You couldn't make a phone call.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:48.880]   Exactly.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.360]   You could text on data.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:53.520]   And we also see that everyone has a TV camera, right?
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.760]   So we've seen incredible documentation of this event.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.560]   Lots of video.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.640]   And a sense of what we never had.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.000]   Next, the speed.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.640]   Doc Serals wrote a great post that basically--
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.800]   I'll paraphrase him-- that Twitter is to cable news
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.080]   as cable news wants to TV.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:09.600]   Absolutely.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.240]   People news is now stale.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.280]   Stales help.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.800]   I get into the loop fatigue, the same 12-hour-old video.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.560]   You don't know how old it is.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.080]   Sure.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.440]   Because the other thing is, I think--
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.120]   I watch people on BBC being extremely--
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.400]   I thought of Twitter.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.720]   Because I watched this guy on this BBC show called
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.160]   World Have Your Say.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.560]   Where the guys are just chatting the way we do.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.040]   Right.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.880]   It's changed this I'm on TV now.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.280]   I'm going to be stiff and inhuman.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.000]   No.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   You are, as you said, the future of TV.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   And you see that.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.280]   Now people are on there with their headsets.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.760]   And they're telling them, this is what happened.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.400]   And that happened.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.800]   And it's very human.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.560]   And we see a new TV.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.360]   So I think in the Japan story, we see technology.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.400]   No, it didn't cause it.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.480]   We'll go to that Twitter argument about Iran and Egypt.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.320]   There were earthquakes before that.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.800]   But we see a huge impact of these connection tools
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.320]   in how we learn about how people are using it.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.440]   All kinds of great things.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.320]   Let me ask the question.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.640]   How many of you here in the audience
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.320]   first heard about what happened in Japan
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:07.560]   on the internet, on Twitter?
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.320]   How many of you first heard about it on TV or the radio?
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.560]   So still some people.
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.720]   I mean, I was 11 o'clock at night at California time.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:21.360]   And I saw all of a sudden a huge amount of traffic on Twitter.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.480]   I got a link to Al Jazeera so I could watch it live.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.880]   I got a link to NHK world so I could watch it live.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.360]   I was starting to see videos.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.360]   My wife ran into the bedroom to turn on CNN.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.760]   I stayed on my computer.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.880]   I was talking about that on tech news today.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.040]   I saw an all things D post about it,
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.720]   that when I was going through my RSS feeds.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.520]   And that led me to immediately launch Al Jazeera English
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.400]   to see what was happening in real time
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.080]   and start looking at Twitter to find out
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.160]   if there's anything I missed.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.800]   I never even thought about turning on the television.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.800]   Because I didn't need to.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.640]   Because I didn't need to.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.480]   Al Jazeera English, though you can't get it on TV,
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.400]   is becoming not just Middle East from random news.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.880]   But now for Japan you went to it.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:58.200]   And I was sort of trained by the recent Middle East stuff
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.160]   to go like, oh, that's my regular news.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.600]   That's what happened to CNN.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.600]   That's what happened.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.440]   I have happened.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:06.960]   I have learned about the earthquake and the impending tsunami
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.440]   on Twitter.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.600]   And I turned on CNN because I wanted to see moving pictures.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.480]   And after about half an hour, I realized,
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.360]   I just want the CNN anchors to shut up.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.320]   Because they're getting the information from Twitter
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.000]   and Al Jazeera and others online.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:18.520]   Right.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.320]   Exactly how all of my friends on my Twitter stream are.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.040]   And I just-- I don't need their discussion.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.840]   And so to take your analogy a bit farther,
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.760]   it is true that Twitter is to cable news,
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.320]   as cable news was to network news.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.400]   But that is not just referring to the timeliness
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.000]   of the reports.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.800]   And also, I think, speaks to the misinformation.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.120]   When that was one of the things people dawgged cable news
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.800]   about is because it was up to the minute, they were like,
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.000]   we're getting reports that this.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.120]   And then they have to go back later and take back sees.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.600]   Same thing happens to a much bigger degree on Twitter.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.360]   You get a bunch of disinformation.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.240]   But we expect that somewhat.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.880]   And again, I plugged on Twig.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:52.920]   I'm going to mention it here.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.840]   I talked so fast.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.400]   I got tons of tweets asking me who the hell I said.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:01.960]   Andy Carbon, A-C-A-R-V-I-N from NPR,
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.320]   did incredible work with Tunisia and Egypt.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.400]   And then he was finally kind of relaxing a little bit,
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.640]   because Libya was quiet for a day.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.160]   And then, boom, he wakes up.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.960]   And here's the earthquake.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.120]   And he-- 0 to 60 and 1/2 an hour.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.680]   He's been reporting spectacularly.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:15.160]   He's here.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.160]   Oh, he's wearing a towel.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.160]   But that was quite interesting.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:17.520]   A Twitter.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.240]   This is a new screen.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.200]   It's curating Twitter.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.760]   But reporting, which is to use Twitter to aggregate,
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.120]   to curate, to report.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:24.720]   It's unbelievable.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.120]   And he adds journalistic value.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.760]   He'll say-- he'll find out people who are there.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.840]   Because I proposed something this week in my blog.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.080]   The hashtag doesn't work for these kinds of events.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.280]   And I proposed a new convention of a witness tag
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.560]   that you have, let's say, an exclamation point.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.800]   Japanese quake versus hashtag, Japanese quake.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.320]   The hashtag is for discussion.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.120]   The exclamation point is for witnesses.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.120]   So you know they're there.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:47.680]   I love it.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.320]   And how the hell happens?
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:49.720]   I don't know.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.440]   But the point is that you want to separate it out,
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.640]   because as soon as it happened, it gets overloaded
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.120]   with people who-- with a good ninja and are discussing it.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:56.760]   Like we all are.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.120]   And retweet.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.040]   It's useless.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.560]   Just add the exclamation part at the end.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.320]   So you still have a hashtag, so it still works with Twitter.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.320]   This collaboration.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:07.080]   You don't know if somebody's just really excited about hashtag.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:07.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.320]   Like outrageous!
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.480]   Side to the idea.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.120]   That's a good idea.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.560]   So that's a modifier on the hashtag.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.240]   It's a modifier.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.880]   Because the hashtag has to continue to work for you.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.080]   Oh, yeah, both do.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:15.680]   But I get what I--
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.680]   Hashbang on Twitter.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.320]   Hashbang.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:17.840]   Hashbang.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:18.320]   Hashbang.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.560]   No, let me start it.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.520]   Andy adds value here, because he also questions people.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.440]   He says, I don't know if this is true.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.360]   He has caveats.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.960]   He does what a new kind of journalist does.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.280]   And it never ends in a story.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.680]   It's a constant flow of news.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.440]   And I notice he reaches out for confirmation.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:32.720]   All of the time.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.880]   He'll say, hey, I'm hearing this.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.960]   Anybody there can tell me.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.760]   Do you have a picture of it?
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.120]   Can you go take a picture of it?
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:37.760]   What's going on?
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.480]   You know what's interesting.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.400]   I mean, he's an NPR reporter.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:40.920]   Yes.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.160]   This has nothing to do really with NPR.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:46.480]   He has become a journalistic organ on his own.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.040]   Absolutely.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.320]   I talked to his boss yesterday, Kenzie Wilson, who's
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.600]   in charge of digital at NPR.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:53.160]   He's still there with a huge change in otherwise.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:56.400]   And he said that Andy is peppering the newsroom so much
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.160]   with news they can't handle his intake.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.040]   Andy needs to leave NPR and do his own thing.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.400]   No, no, I disagree.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.880]   I look, because you work within the structure that exists
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:05.400]   right now.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.680]   We are getting closer to--
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.400]   We've read so many science fiction stories.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.440]   We're coming out to pay him, right?
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.800]   He's not going to make any money on Twitter.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.200]   We're working on that.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:11.720]   We're working on that.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.400]   Well, and we've read so many science fiction stories
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.880]   about people who in the future you follow a person
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.240]   and their experiences live minute by minute.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.160]   And we're getting closer to that thanks to Twitter.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.240]   But for right now, you're working within the established
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:22.680]   structure.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.160]   So he shouldn't quit.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.880]   I mean, not everybody needs to follow the Leela
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.760]   Port method of creating a more--
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.840]   Screw the established structure.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:30.080]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.640]   How do everyone needs to be so punk rock?
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:32.760]   Brian also makes a good point.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.280]   We don't need any more competitors.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:34.720]   That's true.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.200]   Thank you.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.200]   Well, I just think it's amazing that one person--
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.840]   Oh, can do such a good job of that.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.280]   And he's not using any resources that aren't available
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.680]   to anybody who's online, right?
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:47.440]   One of what I'm looking at is how can my university
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.040]   bring some development talent--
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.160]   We're talking soon--
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.680]   --about how to give him tools to improve what he does.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.880]   How can we examine what he's learned about who's connected
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.840]   with whom and how he learned to find the good person who's
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.960]   really there because so and so knows it.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.040]   All these things-- and there's a new kind of journalism
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.560]   that I want to spread out elsewhere.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.880]   Because we think in journalism that the atomic unit
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.480]   is the article.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.920]   It's not necessarily a story we tell.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.960]   It's adding value to the flow we see.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.800]   There's a certain laziness to being a source-only reporter
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.560]   too that can creep in where you say, all I have to do
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.880]   is state these five facts.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.080]   And I have a story.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:23.640]   And you really don't.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.200]   You haven't done anything that helps anyone.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.120]   What Andy's doing is much more difficult, which is I
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.120]   have to think and curate and weigh and decide
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.160]   that's a good source.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.360]   I think that's true.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.400]   I'm going to elevate that.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:33.900]   Listen.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.520]   It's the kind of thing we do on Twitter.
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.000]   And literally it's driven in breathing.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.960]   I mean, that's the way it is now in 2011.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.720]   I mean, it's a living and breathing play.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.320]   There's morning addition in the middle.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.600]   There's no morning afternoon and night, right?
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.640]   I mean, that's just not how we live.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.200]   It's an instantaneous news cycle.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.240]   We've talked about that.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.440]   It's iterative.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.240]   Can think up be used in a real-time fashion perhaps?
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.560]   Yeah, we're just hooking up.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.840]   We're just hooking into the real-time stream right now.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.080]   So we're already doing that kind of analysis after the fact.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:00:59.800]   Yeah, after the fact.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.200]   But it needs to be real-time.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.760]   It just drives that.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.000]   We're just pulling that in.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.440]   I'm totally thinking of it.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.280]   I think my favorite story about Twitter and the earthquake
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.240]   was I forget where this person was located.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.720]   But someone in the US heard about the earthquake on Twitter,
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.000]   called their family in Japan before--
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.680]   just as it was starting to happen before the phone lines went down
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.800]   and got to have this phone conversation with them
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.000]   before they became unable to be reached while it was happening,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.200]   literally five minutes into it.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.200]   Now those are great stories.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.480]   Please, Twitter is the best medium for this kind of communication.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.000]   Why?
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.440]   He uses Twitter, but would a blog, a live blog,
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.880]   be a better place for him to do that?
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.320]   Well, video is too.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.920]   I talked today, the Guardian had a session today.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.120]   And I was thinking about this.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.520]   There was a lot of talk.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.400]   Night Foundation just gave a million dollars
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.400]   to the Texas Tribune right here in Austin and Bay Citizen.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.640]   And so I was just going to read to a CMS.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.120]   And the problem is news keeps on thinking externally,
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.080]   that are reorganizing internally.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.280]   We ought to be thinking externally and give a dashboard
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.080]   to the public.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:00.640]   Here's what we know.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.240]   Here's what we don't know.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.920]   What do you want us to do and so on and so forth?
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.000]   Well, I think there are new tools to be invented here.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.640]   If we rethink news enough.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.280]   Yeah, forget that.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.360]   Twitter also works really well.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.720]   It's like you're hanging out at Momo's, your favorite bar.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.280]   And someone says, hey, this happened.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.320]   You go, hey, thanks.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.000]   You don't have to go to the bar across the street
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.240]   to find out what that smart person has to say.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:17.720]   Good point.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.640]   Twitter aggregates a lot of these.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.640]   Sorry.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.720]   I mean, with Haiti, we saw a massive outpouring of support
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.440]   and aid for Haiti.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.720]   I'm wondering if we're seeing the same thing for Japan.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.760]   I think we are, actually.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.920]   I think that there's a lot of internet organization.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.480]   Apple has actually put a thing up now
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.680]   that you can donate directly to Japanese aid
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.760]   through the iTunes store.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.000]   They're not taking a cut out of it.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.520]   They're just passing it through.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.200]   Well, they don't get 30 points.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.120]   Why have they got 30%?
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.080]   30 points.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:46.640]   30 points.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.440]   What's wrong with that?
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.640]   They're making exceptions to the rule, I know.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.120]   What's the profit?
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.560]   Sony's over there going, hey, wait a minute.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.440]   I mean, from my standpoint, Japan and New Zealand and Haiti,
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.600]   I mean, this thesis has--
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.160]   this ship has sailed a long time ago.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.840]   We can talk about the variables.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.400]   We could talk about the individual story about the phone
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.160]   call, but this story is going to be repeated over and over.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.440]   I mean, this ship has sailed.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.240]   This is the way it is now.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.720]   Every time there's a situation that's
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.000]   going to look like this, we'll all
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.560]   tell the individual stories about them,
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.800]   but the top line thesis of the way the world reacts
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.440]   and the infrastructure at low costs and speed
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.800]   of how information is being shared
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:30.280]   and the impact on helping people and all those variables
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.960]   has sailed a long time ago, going back to the first one
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.880]   or two events that we were--
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.000]   I like what you say, though, about helping people,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.640]   because it is now a loop.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.840]   It's not merely information consumption.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:43.040]   It is a way to act and participate.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.320]   If you look at what's going on, it's just one big Facebook
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.600]   comments plug-in, isn't it?
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.240]   Because what really matters now is pay attention.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.760]   Pay attention, because here's where I
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.000]   think it's fascinating, Leo.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.600]   I think as our personalities and our true identities,
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.640]   our social equity in our space is so important.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.680]   And you want to take, you want to give,
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.720]   and clearly, everything we're doing--
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.360]   one of my favorite things-- listen,
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.720]   I'm as much of a businessman as anybody.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.800]   I mean, that's where I come from.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.560]   Yeah, that's where I come from.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.800]   That's where I come from.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.760]   And my favorite video I've ever made
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.080]   is in one of the 1,000 episodes of Wine Library TV
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.520]   or the other hundreds of episodes
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.960]   I've done on my personal blog.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.880]   It's one specific video, which is that legacy is greater
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.080]   than currency.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.240]   What we're doing right now, our great, great grandchildren
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.080]   are going to watch this.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:31.960]   Right this second.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.240]   Hey, little Johnny.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.080]   Like, literally, we are documenting our lives
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.880]   with our decisions and our supports
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.360]   and the things that we're doing.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.800]   And I think people are starting to understand that slowly,
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.800]   but surely.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.680]   And we all have a way we want to view ourselves.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.320]   And it's impacting us.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.800]   And it's a very, very big deal.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.080]   The collective betterness of human nature
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.160]   is coming out because what the internet is doing
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.440]   is taking away the shadows from society.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.280]   We live in a public.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:00.680]   OK, now I do want to--
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.600]   What's happening?
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.960]   I do want to disagree.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.000]   You're making a mistake.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.800]   Don't forget, this is being recorded.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.440]   And one day you're praying, I'm kidding.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.000]   I'm going to think you're an idiot.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.440]   Well, here's what I want to disagree with.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.360]   Johnny's grandpa.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.320]   I want to disagree with the idea that the ship is sale.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.920]   Little Stevie's about to think you're an idiot.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.800]   You say the ship is sale.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.000]   As if this is a story that's three or four years old.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.320]   This is a story that's 50 years old.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.880]   This is not a case where something's happened
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.320]   and everything's changed all at once.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.160]   We're seeing a progressive procedural refinement,
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.840]   an increase in resolution of it.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.800]   The ship sailed in the 1950s when they were able to show us
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.080]   footage of the war front or of the earthquakes.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.640]   Why not the 1920s when they were--
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.840]   Of the war, it didn't continue.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.440]   Everything is exactly.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.400]   This is exactly what I'm saying is
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.520]   we're giving examples about Japan.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.480]   Nothing I've heard from a Japan story is any different
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.280]   than I've heard from a Haiti or Chile or a New Zealand story.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.880]   They're just nuances on the big--
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.080]   Well, but the big difference, Brian,
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.400]   is that it's not from--
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.120]   we didn't wait for the journalists to get there.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:55.640]   That's right.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.800]   The witnesses can now tell the world.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.360]   And that's a big difference.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.720]   Everybody has that in the WordPress.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.240]   Absolutely.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.600]   But Gary seems to have this attitude.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.160]   You show your shoulders like, ah, Christ Church,
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.480]   Japan, what's the difference?
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.560]   I say there is a difference because every tragedy
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.520]   has its own unique story.
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.200]   And it is important that we recognize it
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.480]   and that we react independently to it.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.320]   No, what I think you did was you misunderstood
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.960]   what I was saying, which was all the nuances are different.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.080]   I'm agreeing with you.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.400]   I'm just saying the top line thesis of how this is all
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.000]   happening is the same general thought, of course.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.920]   And what I'm saying is that goes back, like you said,
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.960]   to the 1920s.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.480]   You agree.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.120]   No, but really, the point I think that Brian was making
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.800]   is Jermaine, which is it's coming into focus.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.640]   So you're right.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.200]   This has been going on for a long time.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:33.640]   You're right.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:34.800]   This is nothing new.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.120]   But at the same time, we're just starting to apprehend
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.040]   that it's happening.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.480]   Yes, it's been happening all along.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.960]   But we're starting to see it and understand it.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.840]   You're maybe ahead of us.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.520]   You wrote the book, The Thank You Economy.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.200]   You understand it a little better than others.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.000]   I think people that are at this conference, you know,
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.200]   unless I understand, I understand it.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.280]   We're starting to see it.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.440]   We're starting to understand it now.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.840]   And that's the point.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.280]   The other thing about Japan is that it is going faster
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.880]   and more widespread because it is a much more connected
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.560]   country than even New Zealand.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.000]   Definitely.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.440]   Sure.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.800]   Well, there's a dark side to this, which is that it's also
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:08.280]   a rich country we care about more than Haiti and some other
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.320]   countries where this has happened.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.920]   And I think that's something we have to face up to.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.760]   The New Zealand's--
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.000]   We're going to take a break.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   But I love the learning.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:14.920]   I love the discussion.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.080]   What I'd like to do when we come back is find out what you've
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.920]   learned in South by Southwest this week.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.120]   So we're going to come back.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.320]   We'll give you all a chance to speak.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.480]   We've got a great panel here and a great audience.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:23.920]   Thank you.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.560]   We have Momos.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.240]   We really, really want to be a great fan of you.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.160]   I hope you're joining us.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.160]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.000]   And as long as we're talking about this, I think there's
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.240]   one thing that's got to be--
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.760]   if you're talking about legacy, if you're talking about little
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.200]   Johnny, if you don't have a website, you don't have anything.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.640]   It all starts with a presence on the net.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640]   What a mess.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.080]   This is the problem.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.800]   If you don't have GaryVee.com, if you don't have
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.320]   whyonlibrary.tv.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:50.760]   You're cheating.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.320]   If you're cheating little Johnny, where's he going to
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.200]   find you?
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.240]   If you don't have afterlife.me, if you don't have
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.280]   schwood.com, you've got to have these.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:07:59.760]   Of course.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.800]   Why if you don't have a domain name, here's a chance to get
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.640]   one.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.720]   10% off, as a matter of fact.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.000]   I'm talking about hopper.com.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.640]   Johnny's going to like you 10% more.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.160]   Yeah, we've all been through this going to that other place
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.600]   where you have to click 100 times and get around all
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.760]   the dancing people and things just to get a domain name.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.480]   That's why I like hopper.com.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.400]   It's Canadian.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.040]   That means it's better.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.920]   At least it's nicer, right?
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.240]   It's nicer.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.520]   It's more polite.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.320]   Hopper.com.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   You can register your domain there.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.360]   Tell us a boot.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.720]   No, they speak perfect English.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.400]   It's amazing.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.200]   Automatically, you get the who is privacy that's built in.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.960]   They don't extra no extra charge, no upsell on that.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.800]   They have a great feature, which I like.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:45.200]   No hold on customer service calls Monday through Friday
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.480]   during business hours.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.680]   You will never be put on hold.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.520]   You'll get a representative and you will talk to that
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.720]   representative and they will not put you on hold.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.600]   You don't have to listen to crappy music or the weird ads.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.680]   And if you use Twitch right now as the offer code, you'll get
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.920]   10% off your domain.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.000]   I do want to mention they also will take domain transfers.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   They do a great thing.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.400]   They'll charge you $10 for the transfer, but extend your
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.160]   domain name for another year.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.520]   So it's a $10 extra year and the transfer is all built in.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.240]   So it's just a really great service.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.200]   I am a big fan.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.040]   We are moving all of our sites over.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.200]   I invite you to try it.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.280]   If you're thinking of a new domain name or you want to
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.400]   move your old domain name over, you know, when the kids
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.040]   were born, I don't know if you did this Gary Vee, but I
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.960]   got AbyLaport.com and I got HenryLaport.com.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.400]   I made the same play with Misha.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.320]   It might be old school, but I just feels like maybe they
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.000]   won't need it.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.280]   It's not too late, Brian Brushwood.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.280]   I'm getting good right now.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.120]   Switz.hubloud.com.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.640]   Do it today.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.120]   All right.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.440]   I'm going to beat you to it.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.360]   I'm selling back to you.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.000]   It's a race.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.880]   See if we can get Misha.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.840]   Misha was on it.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.200]   She'll tell us a little Stevie.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.560]   You're going to have to go to Wikipedia and find out the
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.960]   right name sucker.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:55.000]   By the way, on that note, I've heard of somebody closing a
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.760]   deal this week of selling their Twitter name for $100,000.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.360]   What was the name?
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.040]   Do you know?
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.000]   They asked me about the same--
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   It's somebody who's an individual and they had the name
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.680]   of a major, major brand.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.200]   Wow.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:08.840]   And--
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.680]   Oh, I bet I know who it is.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.680]   Who?
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.520]   We don't have to say.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.880]   Joe Rolex.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.360]   But I mean, I've heard of people.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.680]   They secure a name that would be--
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.920]   100 brands, a real number.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.960]   100 brands.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:18.960]   That would--
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.240]   That would be on Callie Lewis.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.920]   She's wearing a t-shirt that says @CallieLewis.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.080]   I mean, that has become a very important part of your brand,
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:26.440]   hasn't it?
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.560]   He's really registering it.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.360]   He's really telling it.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.000]   He is such a bad, bad man.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.560]   All right, let's start on the left and we'll move around
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.560]   starting with Sarah Lane of TNT and iPad today.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.200]   We did an iPad today show yesterday.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.120]   We'll do it on Thursday.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:38.400]   We did.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.600]   We'll roll a lot of that footage into our show
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.120]   next Thursday.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:41.600]   Yep.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.120]   Yep.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.160]   What did you learn at South by Southwest this week?
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.640]   That the people working at the hospital are very nice.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.920]   Of course, Sarah had a mirror.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.440]   I know.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.680]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.440]   It's not.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.520]   No, honestly, I will say--
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.720]   I mean, this is apart from the whole geek part of South by
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.920]   Southwest interactive is that I do find that whenever I come
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.440]   to Texas-- and I know this isn't just Austin.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440]   This Austin just happens to be the only city I've been to
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.320]   in Texas.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.640]   There is a certain niceness.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.200]   I can't put my finger on it, but I see it everywhere.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.160]   I think they're all Canadians.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.560]   It's the Canada of Texas.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.400]   Canada of Texas.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.480]   They got funny Canadian accents then.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:21.560]   But this year is the biggest year, at least for
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.560]   interactive.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.400]   It's huge.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.800]   We've all heard the stories.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.400]   They said last year was the biggest year and this year is
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.400]   a third bigger.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.760]   And I found that more than ever, I'm not running into all
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.560]   the peeps down on 6th Street the way that I have in years
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.080]   past.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.920]   I've got to go seek out my buddies.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:39.320]   That's a good point.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.640]   Or even more so, I have to go seek out people that I want
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.840]   to meet because we're not all going to be at the same party
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.200]   because there's five of them.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.320]   And they all started seven.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.000]   And then at 10, there's another thing.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.080]   And then Gary's got his cool, fun underground party and it's
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.000]   like, now I have to make choices.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.320]   And I'm not saying that that's a bad thing.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:56.720]   It's--
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.320]   I mean, what did you say?
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320]   Nothing.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.960]   I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but you have to--
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.280]   it's like being at a big--
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.680]   it's like being at a big music venue.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.680]   And there's six bands.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.760]   It's less clubby, though.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.840]   In a way I like it that it's less clubby because there's
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.440]   more diversity, more variety.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.160]   It's less clubby.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.560]   But then you've got the CNN truck and the CNN grill.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.040]   And it's like--
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.520]   Yeah, like what the hell are they doing?
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.080]   I'm not bagging on CNN at all.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.120]   But there is something about it that you sort of go, oh wow.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.880]   South by Southwest is starting to become--
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.720]   Yeah, grow up.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.200]   And every man type of event.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.320]   And it's just-- it's not little anymore.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.400]   It's grown up.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.440]   It's all grown up.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.920]   Tom Merritt, what have you learned this week?
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.880]   Well, I got three things.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.280]   One, Sarah is an incredible trooper.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.120]   She's got a really severe ear infection.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.160]   She's like, no, I'm there.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.000]   What do you need?
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   I'm ready to do TNT.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:41.560]   I'm doing Twit.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.680]   I just have to go to the hospital real quick.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.800]   And then I'll be back.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.640]   So big, big props to Sarah for--
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.200]   A big kid.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.800]   Not really whining or anything.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:49.640]   Just stick it in.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   Thank you.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.320]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.000]   She's a pro.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.200]   Number two.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.120]   It's really nice to cover South by Southwest
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.360]   with a bunch of other people.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.120]   It's a lot easier than--
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.360]   Jason Howell, that was what I'm talking about.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.360]   Last year it was me, a backpack and a camera on a staff.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.920]   I felt like Gandalf.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920]   This is amazing.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.120]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.120]   You look to the whole surface.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.120]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.200]   We've come a long way.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.360]   One shout-poss.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.400]   And then-- but third, I am impressed
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.880]   that South by Southwest are interactive.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.920]   As kept growing, there was a dot-com bust, right?
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.080]   And South by Southwest, interactive actually got bigger.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:28.320]   There was a recession, and interactive got bigger.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.520]   And we were all talking about the problems of it getting bigger,
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.560]   and it's less intimate, and you can't find people as much.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.400]   But I think it's a testament to something.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.960]   We were talking about this on TNT that this isn't
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.880]   got a product.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.720]   This isn't CES where it's all about the latest gadgets.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.160]   This isn't even Comic-Con, where it's
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.920]   like finding out the new movie announcements,
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.080]   or what's happening in the fantasy world.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.880]   It's hard to put your finger on what this is.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.240]   And in fact, I don't want to steal Brian's line because--
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:53.840]   Stealing away, sir.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.600]   I think he's got the finger on the line.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.240]   Just say the following is a retweet.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:57.920]   No, no, no.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.480]   I'm going to let you talk about it.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.040]   But he's got a really good point about what he thinks it is.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.400]   But I think we all have a different perspective
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.280]   on what we get out of it.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.760]   But they've built something really good here
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.120]   that allows you to get out of it what you want
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.080]   and learn something without having to sit
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.360]   in a boring conference if you don't want to.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.680]   Sure as hell I am boring.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.920]   Thank you, John.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.480]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.400]   So I saw on Twitter as I was arriving.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.200]   Somebody say, I've never been before,
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.480]   but how do I act like a veteran?
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.480]   And my advice was, you complained
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.080]   that it's not as good as last year.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.800]   South by is so over.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.720]   Yeah, it's so--
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.080]   So it's open to commercial.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:34.960]   Jump the beluga.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.280]   Much.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.680]   I will say this year, maybe it's because I'm old
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.480]   and haven't shaved and look young like Gary,
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.000]   because of separating us up into tribes,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   I think they've hurt the hallway and the hallway
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.440]   is the whole value, which is what you're saying, Sarah,
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.360]   is that if I stood in the convention center,
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.160]   my whole world passed, my whole world, the whole tribe.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.920]   And now I'm in the--
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.440]   by the way, tomorrow, five o'clock,
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.560]   I'm in the Hyatt, speaking about publicness.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.880]   It's halfway to Dallas, but please all come.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.520]   It's a long way.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.400]   It's over the river.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.200]   There's a shark there.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.400]   We're going to jump over it and go see it.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.480]   Sorry for the plug.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.280]   But that's the point.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.280]   I was going from the Sheraton to the Hyatt.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.680]   And if I'm sitting in the bad session,
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.720]   you know, you used to see on Twitter, there was a whole point.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.560]   You go next door.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.960]   Now you've got to go 20 minutes.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.120]   You can't do it.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.120]   So the question becomes, necessarily,
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.880]   should there be a scarcity to South by?
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:29.240]   Right?
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:29.760]   You're right.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.080]   The good thing is it grows.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.200]   And the whole discussion of "too big" is ludicrous.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.760]   It's rather snobby.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.400]   But there's a practical question.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.360]   The reason I'm here is because of you, Goombas,
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.640]   is because of the tribe and the people I know
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.240]   and want to meet new people and all that.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.160]   And I want to mix with people with different interests.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.200]   And now the interests are there's journalism,
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.000]   and there's social, and there's technology.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:54.840]   And I regret that.
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.400]   There's the women's channel over here.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.720]   So I don't know what you do about it.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.640]   What would that mean?
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.560]   It would mean that you'd have to sell out--
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.880]   it would mean that you'd have to buy a sellout.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.800]   I mean, small, that small low.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.800]   Have fewer sessions, have fewer seats,
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.640]   and just limit cap South by Southwest.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.880]   What do you think of that?
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.800]   Maybe they stick it down from IRC and spawn new conferences.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.880]   That's what I would do.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.880]   That's what I would do.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.880]   You're exactly right.
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:18.880]   So I don't want that either.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.640]   So I don't know how to-- how does South by Southwest scale?
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.680]   It's a scale problem.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.920]   It's having-- like every--
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.320]   Let me stop in here for a month.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.600]   Make it longer.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.600]   The last 10 standing of a cool--
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.320]   I think we need to do new year one.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.040]   I think we need new social tools.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.960]   That's what I-- I think that's what we're lacking here.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.800]   Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.680]   Thank you for more tools.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.400]   Thank you, Dr. Rens.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.000]   Gina Trapani, life as smarter we're not already.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.880]   This is my six year at South by Southwest,
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.360]   and every year I swear that I'm not
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.120]   going to come back because it's too big and I'm a snob.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.400]   But then I come back to relearn the lesson
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.680]   that I love learning at Tech Conference,
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.120]   is that it's all about the people.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.360]   The internet is made of people.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.560]   Your relationships are more important than your iPad
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.240]   and your apps and your startup.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.680]   And I love coming here and hanging out with really creative,
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.800]   cool, fun folks.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.760]   And especially for someone who doesn't live in San Francisco
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.440]   or New York, it's really cool for me to come to South by
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.000]   and actually be able to see my friends
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.960]   checked in on Forceware a couple blocks away
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.240]   versus like in another city.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.720]   So I'm really happy that you all here and I'm thrilled to be here.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.200]   That's great.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:13.560]   Thank you.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.360]   It's all about the people.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.120]   Gary Vaynerchuk.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.080]   I think I'm going to piggyback off of Gina's phenomenal point,
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.720]   which is that I came here four years ago.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.120]   And nobody really knew who I was.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.640]   I had a wine show on the internet.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.440]   So there's a couple of people that kind of knew.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.440]   And it was a big coming out party for me.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.760]   And I just remember trying to talk to some of the cool kids
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.920]   and people kind of brushed me off, but kind of brushed me off.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.200]   And I've really enjoyed this year because more people
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:40.840]   recognize me.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.120]   But what I've been most impressed with is, wow,
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:47.840]   there are some really smart, really passionate 25
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.880]   and under kids, or maybe more 45 and older people.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.400]   You know that--
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:51.920]   Thank you, Gary.
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.440]   --are trying to break their apps and put it back.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.280]   But it's true, Jeff.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.760]   There's a big thing I always talk in my talks, which
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.040]   is that I try to change my seat when I'm on flights.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:05.360]   And I fly a lot and try to sit with a 90-year-old person.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.120]   Because I think they've played the game that we've lived.
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.680]   And none of them ever say they wanted more money or other things.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.200]   They wish they did more things they loved or spent more time
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:13.800]   with their family.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.000]   And I'm always like, geez, these guys have played-- they all
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:16.760]   say the same thing.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.600]   They've played the game.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.560]   So that's what you need to focus on.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.040]   I think what's been really hitting me
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.880]   is I've been going out of my way to have conversations
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.120]   with just new people, first-year people,
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.280]   trying to give feedback or help, and just listening
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.840]   to a million pitches about a bunch of different things.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   And I've been very impressed with the collective wisdom,
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.600]   young and old.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.400]   And Gina's got it in peg.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.280]   This thing only is on the back of the people in the room.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:42.640]   Love it.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.800]   Thank you, Gary Vee.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:44.440]   Take a while.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:44.960]   I learned Leo.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:45.680]   What did you learn?
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.720]   I learned the importance of registering my daughter's
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.520]   domain name, pennybrushwood.com.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.680]   Now register.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.640]   But also what we were talking about on Tech News today,
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.440]   and I forget who tweeted it out originally,
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.760]   and I retweeted it live on the show,
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.920]   is CES is to gadgets as South by Southwest
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.640]   is to relationships.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.040]   It's an ineffable quality to having a beer with someone
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.400]   and feeling a connection with them
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.040]   that will yield dividends years down the road.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.600]   And you won't even remember how you met that person.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.520]   But all of a sudden, you become a featured item
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.640]   on their blog or whatever.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.360]   It's about those relationships and the connections.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.760]   And as far as it getting too big,
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.360]   that is the perennial question.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.480]   Is there anyone here who lives in Austin
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.040]   here in the audience makes a noise?
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:27.840]   OK, we've got a bunch of--
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.320]   Whoa, a lot of people.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:29.720]   A lot of people.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.800]   For 17 years, I've been hearing about how Austin has gotten
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.440]   too big.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.240]   And of course, there's some growing pains.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.960]   But I think by and large, Austin has acquitted itself
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.000]   very, very well.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.320]   And I think what you guys are feeling
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.160]   is the same type of growing pains
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.280]   that the people who live here in Austin experience as well.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.080]   And I'm just thrilled you guys dig the town enough
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:47.880]   to keep coming back.
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.440]   Great town.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.320]   Thanks for keeping it weird, Brian.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.760]   78751.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.480]   Brian Rushwood, finally Lisa Bettany,
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.920]   what have you learned this week?
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.480]   This is only my seconds out by Southwest.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:02.320]   And I think just the impression from last year to this year
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.400]   is just how successful you can be
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.920]   and how you can start with literally nothing
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:12.800]   and how so many people are doing this now.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.320]   I just made an app.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:18.760]   And how literally there isn't one story,
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.160]   like you say, of this South Bay.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.400]   It's not mobile.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.720]   It's that everyone can do this.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.560]   Everyone can just learn how to do it and get an app out
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.920]   or start a startup.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.360]   And there's a lot of positive energy.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.400]   So great to have you all.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.200]   The thing I've learned is if you want to have a really good
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.160]   party, come to Austin, come to Mobos,
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.120]   and get your whole friends and family and everybody come out
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:42.680]   and join us.
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.280]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.520]   Thank you so much.

[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:46.860]   Thank you.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:47.360]   Thank you.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.880]   Brian Rushwood, Lisa Bettany, here.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.880]   Joe Hoswell, I could go on and on.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.000]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:54.880]   We'll see you next week.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.880]   Another trip.
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.960]   We're doing the game.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:57.960]   Good night, everybody.
