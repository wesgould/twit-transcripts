[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.520]   of this week in tech.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.920]   I hope you enjoyed last week's holiday special with John
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.920]   Hodgman, Jonathan Colton, Paul, and Storm.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.640]   And that strange Roderick fellow who showed up.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.880]   This one's going to be a little different.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.520]   This is our yearly best.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.840]   We'd like to end the year with a look back
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.080]   at some of the great stories of 2012.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.520]   And we've got a bunch of them for you.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.560]   We're going to kick off with one of the stories
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160]   that happened early in the year that was a bit of a shocker
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.120]   and gave rise to a new monetary unit on the internet.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.640]   One Instagram.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.080]   Watch as we talk about Facebook purchasing
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.480]   Instagram for $1 billion.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.240]   Let's start.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.400]   Let's start because they're big story.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   And I apologize for people who listen to all our shows
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.000]   because this story broke Monday, the day after last week's
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.560]   twit.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.960]   So if you listen to all our shows,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.520]   we've gone through every show now to talk about this story.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.080]   But we haven't done it yet on twit.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.760]   And we need to.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.600]   And I've got a great panel to talk about it.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.680]   Instagram, selling to Facebook.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.360]   This company's 15 months old, 12 employees.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.840]   They are an iOS app recently released in Android app.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.680]   Boy, we couldn't have a better panel here to talk about it.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.800]   We've got one of the great photographers here, $1 billion.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   Now, you're not going to preoccupy yourself
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.440]   with the price, with the money that's floating around.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.920]   Because you did that on the show, on the radio.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.080]   Hard not to.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.320]   But I mean, you just was--
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.920]   If it were $999 million, it would be the same story.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.280]   You said that exact same thing.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.400]   You're not going to be in the nice round number.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.520]   But don't you think it's a materialistic analysis?
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.880]   And we should be looking at the possible reasons
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.160]   that they did this rather than--
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.840]   Anything with $1 billion is materialistic.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.920]   I don't care what.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.440]   All right.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.920]   According to the Verge, Dante Orazio writing,
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.960]   it took Mark Zuckerberg two days to make this deal.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.760]   You think it was a rush to judgment?
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.160]   No, I don't think he wanted anyone else to start a bidding war.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.840]   I think they just--
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.480]   Is that what it was?
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.960]   Defensive?
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.200]   No, I can't believe there'd be a bidding war.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.120]   New York Times says--
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.760]   It was like to believe it was defensive,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.480]   but I don't believe there would be a bidding war.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.840]   Not at that price.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.360]   The company--
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.440]   The whole story is just so ridiculous.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.880]   The company had just been valued at $500 million
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.520]   a couple months ago.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.680]   Also ridiculous.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.600]   It's a picture sharing mobile app.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.520]   It's an app.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.040]   All it's--
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.200]   It's not even a website.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.720]   It's not anything.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.600]   Yes, it has a lot of users.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.240]   But every one of those users, Jolie,
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.600]   doesn't every one of those users probably
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.680]   a Facebook member already?
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.160]   I mean, doesn't Facebook know more about that?
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.000]   Yes, which gives it away.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.120]   No, here's what it is.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.040]   It's a series of filters.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.480]   It's a series of filters.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.640]   In the IPO filing documents, everybody was saying, oh,
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.720]   you know, mobile is Facebook's biggest weakness
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.160]   when you're talking about investors
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.800]   and publicly traded Facebook stock.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.760]   So this is Facebook saying, hey, no, we can do mobile.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.360]   Look, we bought a big mobile company for a billion dollars.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.840]   Isn't that competent of us?
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   And maybe it is.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.440]   Sure, I'm not privy to those discussions.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.880]   But it's so bubbly.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.280]   I talked to people who lived--
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.080]   Bubbly, in the sense of like a stock bubble.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.640]   I lived to--
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.360]   I talked with people who went through the '90s.com bust.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.080]   And they said--
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.280]   You were 12 at the time.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.280]   No.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.000]   Darling, I was working in my first--
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.720]   Were you already?
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.280]   Yeah, I was.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.360]   I had my first startup job in 1999.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.680]   So you lived through this, actually?
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.880]   I am older than I look.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.400]   Yes.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   Yes.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.560]   So no, but everyone who is from that era is saying, OK,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.240]   this is the kind of deal that makes people terrified
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.680]   that our whole internet economy is going to collapse again.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.680]   Oh, it's overheated.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.760]   Oh, god, it's ridiculous.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.880]   A billion dollars.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.440]   No, wait a minute.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.480]   I think with the brains at this table,
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.040]   we could figure out why.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.320]   I had a good column in market watch about this.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.240]   Why did this happen?
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.000]   Because the number of users--
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.600]   I think you said on your other show.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.360]   30 million.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.320]   Are all Facebook users already?
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.400]   And they were ripe for the plucking.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.760]   Google could have grabbed them all
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.880]   and picked up 33 million people right off the top.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.520]   And Facebook is starting to exhibit
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.040]   the Microsoft paranoia qualities.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.120]   And I think this is one evidence of it.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.280]   They are getting just-- and Google's showing this, too.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.400]   They're paranoid about things going on around them.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.760]   Because all of it, they're making so much money,
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.840]   they can't even consider the possibility
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.920]   that the competition might be good for them.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.400]   So they did a defensive move, grabbed this thing
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.440]   and got a sheer paranoia.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.240]   And for us, I'm concerned, pulled a Yahoo.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.600]   This is the broadcast.com.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.000]   This is broadcast.com, exactly.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It's a broadcast.com.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.880]   How long before Kevin Sister and the CEO of Instagram
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.360]   buys the Portland Trail Blazers and runs
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.600]   onto the court throwing chairs?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.720]   It's a matter of months.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.800]   They have to buy him from Paul Allen, who won't sell him.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.480]   But they could buy the Seattle team, which is moved to--
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.840]   or they could create a new Seattle team,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.480]   because the other teams moved to Oklahoma City.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.320]   There you go.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.480]   You know, taking the devil's advocate side,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   it's really easy to look at this and say, obviously,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.160]   they overpaid.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.640]   They have a billion dollars for a couple of filters
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.840]   and a few users that Facebook probably already has.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   Already has.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.040]   Seems like a lot of money.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.440]   But this is a particularly vulnerable time for Facebook.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.480]   They are in IPO land now.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.560]   And they don't want any competition when the IPO finally
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.240]   hits.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.160]   They don't want any questions about whether or not
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.120]   they are the number one mobile space.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.440]   Well, is it really competition when all of the Instagram
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.760]   photos get pushed to Facebook?
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.560]   And Facebook is the one that monetizes those.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.720]   It would be if Twitter or Google+ bought them.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.040]   And flipped that little switch there.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.760]   But didn't Twitter just buy a photo sharing?
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.760]   Well, certainly Twitter couldn't afford a billion dollars.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.640]   It didn't buy a Twit pick.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.160]   Which one did they buy?
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.480]   I don't know.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.120]   Anyhow, Twitter bought one.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.240]   Facebook bought one.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.120]   I'm going to go buy one.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.240]   It doesn't even matter.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.240]   According to The Times, Mr. Zuckerberg--
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.520]   that's how you know it's The Times.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.400]   Mr. Zuckerberg--
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.080]   paid place to call on Friday-- last Friday, a week ago--
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.520]   to Kevin Systrom, the CEO and founder of Instagram.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.280]   And a very nice guy.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.880]   We interviewed him when Instagram came out.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.080]   And he was still one of us.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.880]   According to people with knowledge of the matter,
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.480]   who spoke on condition of anonymity
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.120]   because of discussions for private,
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.320]   Mr. Zuckerberg was blunt, they said.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.000]   A Facebook wanted to buy Instagram over the next 48 hours.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.320]   Facebook and Instagram hammered out the details
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.240]   for a $1 billion cash and stock deal.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.400]   You got to-- I can imagine that call.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.240]   Hi, Kevin.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.560]   It's Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.080]   Yeah, Mark Zuckerberg, yeah.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.920]   Hey, I want to buy you.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.080]   And Kevin thinks, hmm, I don't want to sell.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.120]   Sure, Mark, it'll be a billion dollars.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.840]   OK, where do I send the check?
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.600]   You can't turn down a billion dollars.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.680]   Maybe it's already said a million.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680]   What?
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.080]   I think that's really-- I think that's what happened.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.640]   I think Kevin said, yeah, yeah, sure.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.480]   A billion dollars.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.040]   And Mark said, he didn't blink.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.560]   Yeah, sure.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.400]   Well, here's a vector--
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.320]   But he got it for 1.5.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.080]   Here's something that.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.400]   No one's really talking about.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.160]   And I think something's happening right in front of us,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.000]   right underneath us.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.760]   And no one really understands it.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.320]   But I think the way humans are starting
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.960]   to communicate with each other is evolving.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.160]   It's going to visual, isn't it?
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.760]   It's becoming a picture-sharing society.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.680]   I think right.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.760]   For years, ever since Gutenberg, right, at the printing press,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.120]   we've been converting concepts into words and paragraphs.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.560]   Mm-hm.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.840]   And that's how we've communicated.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.720]   In fact, that's how we've communicated on the web forever.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.240]   But if things continue at their current rate
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.520]   and we're sharing more and more photos,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   you can communicate concepts and stories and ideas with photos
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.040]   almost as effectively as words.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.400]   It's not better or worse than words.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.360]   It's just different.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.640]   It's faster.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.800]   It's easier.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.160]   And it's more mobile-friendly.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.080]   And I think that's very important.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.840]   Very much so.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.000]   Here's an important yum.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.720]   In fact, as you say that, Trey, I think about my use.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   I use path and Instagram.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.200]   And most often, we'll send a picture.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.480]   And maybe a few words.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.240]   And look, most everybody now, if you have a streaming type
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.880]   of life, right, you just flip through the words
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.000]   until you see a picture that's interesting.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.240]   And then you might read some words around it.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.280]   Right.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.480]   And Instagram is a pure photo sharing thing.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.000]   And if you think about humans, as we develop, basically,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.600]   from age three till 10, you're learning
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.760]   this alphanumeric system and how to convert concepts
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.280]   into cogent sentences.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.200]   That is a huge amount of human development time.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.720]   But what if people just start sharing photos
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.560]   to share stories of their life, to share concepts?
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.440]   Actually, Pinterest exploits this thought.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.120]   It feels like going backwards a little bit
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.320]   to Cuneiform if you ask.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.080]   You've got to think, Pinterest is probably
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.240]   nest on the block.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.320]   How much is Pinterest worth?
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.120]   If this is worth a billion dollars,
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.720]   this is the popular page right now on Instagram.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.680]   These are the pictures that most people like.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.040]   This depresses me.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.840]   This makes me sad for humanity.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.720]   They're not deep.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.880]   It's pictures of food and shoes and weirdos.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.920]   Who is that?
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.640]   Well, there's a marriage proposal.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.680]   That's a great thing to do.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.240]   Do it on Instagram, sure.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.000]   Well, who is he talking to?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.800]   Maybe all of you.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.200]   There's no question that language continually evolves.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.720]   We're always changing the way that we're trying to convey
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.560]   meaning.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.440]   But getting back to the main story--
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.920]   I don't see that.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.080]   Thank you, Pudger.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.640]   Getting back on the rails.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.880]   Even granted, that communication is shifting.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.560]   I don't see the value in a purchase like this.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.680]   Defensive, is it an act higher?
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.240]   Were they looking at a core technology?
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.440]   Is there a patent portfolio?
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.640]   The answer to all those questions is no.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.160]   I think Jolie hit the nail on the head.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.840]   The stock, the IPO's coming up.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.000]   Mark might have said, if we lose this,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.800]   it could cost us a billion dollars in the IPO.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.760]   It might be worth it.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.600]   It's almost like they just spun a roulette wheel
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.320]   and said, OK, Instagram, they're big right now.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.480]   So give it up for Kevin, the luckiest guy in America.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.480]   $400 million.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.000]   $1 million.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.560]   There we go again.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.960]   He gets $400 million out of that.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.480]   Although I found the timing really weird,
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.920]   because I think they collected a significant round
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.320]   of funding, something like a day
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.800]   to be for--
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.640]   Somebody bought in a week before this happened.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.520]   How do you not know that?
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.240]   Happy people.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.080]   That's a lottery ticket.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.880]   Happy people.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.400]   They won a lot.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   That was probably inside information.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.480]   But with your due diligence, how do you not know?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.800]   I agree with John.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.680]   How do you not know that the company--
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.480]   Is this happening to you?
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.680]   --you're investing in is getting acquired by Facebook.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.480]   I don't buy it.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.440]   I think somebody knew something on a roulette.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.560]   Well, I think that we can take the opposite angle
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.640]   on what she just said, which is not
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.320]   that it was to make Facebook look good to the potential
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.720]   investors and save a billion dollars.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.840]   But now, I think, potential investors
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.400]   look at it and say, well, these guys are kind of crazy.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.480]   This is a dumb idea.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.720]   This is a stupid thing to do.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.200]   We should maybe--
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.880]   It should hurt them.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.040]   And I'll tell you, I think this is going on with these guys
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.120]   are going to do a bunch of non-voting stock IPOs.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.440]   Google's pulling the stunt, which is completely ridiculous.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.720]   That's getting people very upset.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.760]   In fact, they say that's even the most evil thing--
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.520]   given all the evil things Google's done this year,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.240]   that's the most evil.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.160]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.640]   These retirement funds are going to pull out of Google.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.240]   You watch cowpers and things like that.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.200]   And these are big investors.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.560]   These institutional investors can make a huge difference
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.440]   in the valuation of stock.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.080]   Do you think that's the best way to just get into Google?
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.000]   Or was that IBM or something else?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.920]   I think it was Google.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.040]   I'm so into Google.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.120]   Google that.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.440]   There is another angle in the story.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.360]   And that is back when the IPO story was fresh.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.880]   There was a TNT episode called 57% Zuck.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.200]   And the whole idea was--
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.160]   He owns most of it.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.200]   It's Zuck.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.560]   If you're investing in Facebook, you're actually investing
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.160]   in Zuckerberg.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.600]   Well, in the old show.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.080]   No decision can be made without him.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.720]   So, I mean, does Zuckerberg just have a liking for Instagram?
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.760]   That's kind of what the Times article said.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   Is this just showing--
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.560]   I want this product so I'm buying it.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.440]   I got a bunch of cash.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:04.920]   Why not?
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.760]   I got the checkbook.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.520]   Also, don't you think if they can put those stupid filters
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.480]   on Facebook as a Facebook feature, wouldn't it make Facebook
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.360]   photo sharing even more popular?
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:13.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.840]   But you know, they don't need Instagram to do that.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.600]   It makes it easier.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.960]   You mentioned the other day, there's dozens of Instagram
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.480]   plus.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.720]   Did it beforehand?
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.640]   You've got-- how many filters in your 100 cameras in one?
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.560]   There's 100, Leo.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.360]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.280]   So it's not like Instagram has a monoclon.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.160]   It's a uname to get that.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.680]   I know.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.600]   We wrecked our brains trying to come up with another one.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.080]   You know who missed out on this and probably came very close,
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.600]   Hipstomatic, which predates Instagram.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.200]   In fact, just--
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.680]   Oh, but I have a little theory about why that happened.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.960]   I think the fact that Instagram was willing to go into Android
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.160]   territory made a huge, huge difference in that price,
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.920]   especially.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.600]   It happened two weeks before the sale.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.720]   Two weeks-- three weeks ago, I was at Facebook HQ,
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.640]   and I was talking to them, and they were like, yeah,
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.840]   iPhone's a big deal.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.960]   Android is as big a deal, and the mobile web is twice as big--
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.280]   Facebook said this.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.520]   Facebook said this to me, but they showed us the numbers.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.200]   And they also said, we see the entire spectrum
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.720]   of mobile access technologies as one and the same.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.640]   They're all kind of people.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.000]   So that kind of lends credence to the idea
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.760]   that maybe Instagram knew about this ahead of time,
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.360]   and maybe Instagram said, quick, get an Android app quick.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   For me to come here and posit conspiracy theories,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:23.720]   that's just--
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.840]   No, that's Jon's job.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.920]   Because they put this off.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.640]   I mean, I asked Instagram every time I saw them.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.480]   Android happened.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.280]   They say, we're working on it.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:30.760]   We're working on it.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.160]   We're working on it.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.960]   The big question for me is, if they could pay a billion
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.320]   dollars for Instagram, why couldn't they
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.720]   throw 100 million at Kodak?
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   Just a bone.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   Just a bone.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.240]   Actually Kodak has a looking at there.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.240]   Right?
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   Enterprise value.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.240]   You'd have to pay $750, $750 million
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.000]   bucks Kodak your own straight up.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   Wow.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.520]   You know, it's kind of speaking of the value ratio.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.360]   It would be more interesting.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.480]   And they have all half of these.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.160]   They have filters.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.240]   They're made out of glass, but damn.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.040]   I thought it was kind of interesting that Instagram is
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.080]   actually worth more than the New York Times.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.920]   Oh, geez.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.320]   Yeah, the whole thing is ludicrous.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320]   It's bizarre.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.320]   Morley Ayata.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.680]   All right, I hope you're enjoying this best of our annual
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.120]   look back at some of the big stories of 2012.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.040]   Well, we don't do that annually, but some of the big
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.960]   stories of the year.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.640]   Next year, we'll do 2013.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.680]   Because I guess they would save time in editing if we just
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.440]   did a look back at 2012 from now on.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.640]   We could really simplify things a little bit.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.480]   We're going to come back in a second with a look at an
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.640]   announcement that happened twice in 2012.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.600]   The new iPad.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.880]   But first, I'd like to talk a little bit about one of our
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.720]   favorite sponsors or company that's been with us since
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.280]   almost the beginning of it.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.720]   And we really love having them with us.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.520]   Audible.com.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.800]   I don't have to tell you about how great audio books are.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.640]   Audible.com is the place to get audio books on
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.480]   the internet.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.880]   100,000 strong in every category.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.800]   Fiction.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.560]   Nonfiction.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.080]   There's history.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.240]   There's science fiction.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.120]   There's thrillers.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.480]   There's mysteries.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.000]   Of course, you learn a lot at Audible.com, too.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.280]   There's business books, technology books.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.320]   I'm just a huge fan.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.400]   Storm of Swords is coming out.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.840]   The third book in the game of Thrones,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.520]   Sixology, I guess you'd call it.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.360]   There's Six of Books, I think, of the game of Thrones.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:19.920]   Thanks.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.520]   But HBO and March will be coming out early next year with
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.400]   the third in the series.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.040]   I am of the opinion, and I've been doing this.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.440]   You got to read the book before the show comes out,
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.040]   because, well, I think it enhances your enjoyment of the show.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.880]   But also, you don't want any spoilers before you read the book.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.800]   So I've read book one and two of Game of Thrones,
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.600]   but now it's time for Storm of Swords.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.160]   How about getting that for free?
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.240]   That's a lot of hours of Audible content for free.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.800]   This is part of the good news that Audible has made nearly
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.160]   every book at Audible.com a single credit.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.320]   This used to be a two credit book, and it's now a one credit
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.240]   book, which means you can get it for free and get another book
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.040]   when you go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.360]   You'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.320]   That's two credits a month.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.200]   But your first month is free.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.240]   Your first books are free.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.280]   You cancel at any time, pay nothing, and there's still yours
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.080]   to keep forever and ever.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.200]   I want you to try it all.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.560]   I really do want you to try it all.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.800]   So do what me a favor and take advantage of this special offer.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.760]   Two books or two credits, depending on the book,
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.960]   but I think Storm of Swords would be one credit.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.840]   In fact, you could read the next two.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:32.040]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, use that special URL
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:39.360]   so that you get the special deal, audible.com/twit2.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.080]   I think the Sanderson book is still available, too.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.800]   So again, make these three books.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.920]   If you go to audible.com/ Sanderson,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.800]   you can get a copy of Brian Sanderson's great novella
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.200]   legion.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.880]   This was such a good book, absolutely free.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.920]   No trial, no credit card, even if you're already a member.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:02.880]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E slash.com/S-A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.

[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.360]   We thank Audible so much for their support and wish them
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.720]   not only the happiest of holidays, but a really great 2013
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.600]   as we go into it together.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.840]   Yes, the new iPad is here.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.680]   We got to say that twice this year.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.840]   Let's take a look at the first announcement
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.480]   from episode 345.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.520]   So this was the week the iPad came out.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.760]   Now, Ms. Warley has not seen a new iPad.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.280]   I will--
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.240]   What?
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.680]   I know.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.720]   Can you believe it?
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.280]   I said, I guess I haven't seen one yet either.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.360]   So do you have any--
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.800]   Well, here, you can look at that.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.720]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.480]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.640]   Go ahead and just type on that.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.400]   What do you think about it, Denise?
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.760]   It's really good looking, isn't it?
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.600]   No, I'll tell you, at first, I thought,
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.760]   this screen was going to--
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.520]   your eyes would go like Jessica Rabbit with [SINGING]
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.120]   but they don't actually do that.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.360]   It's not immediately apparent how much better it is.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.720]   But as you spend time with it, it gets better and better.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:06.960]   You really--
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.600]   Where do you notice it most?
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   Well, launch a book application would be one thing to do,
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.280]   because text is, of course, incredibly crisp.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.520]   So I'll launch the Kindle app, and you'll
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.720]   see immediately that it's--
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.080]   Also in video, in HD video, it really, really looks good.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.440]   Well, that's one question, because OK, the screen
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.160]   is quad resolution 3.1 megapixels.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:35.520]   And it is now 2048 by 1536, means it could do 1080p video.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.240]   But on a screen that size, I don't know.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.480]   Is there much of a difference between a 720p video
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.160]   and a 1080p video?
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.920]   Do you notice a difference?
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.600]   I mean, I was testing some clips I have here,
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.680]   and definitely the 1080p video I downloaded from iTunes looks
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.640]   way better on the new iPad versus the iPad 2.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.960]   I mean, you definitely see the difference.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.160]   But you see the difference at even standard definition
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.920]   video on that screen.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.480]   I just feel like it's not--
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.480]   It's the same IPS style LCD screen.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.200]   It's not a super AMOLED or something.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.160]   But the resolution is so high, it is, I think, 260 pixels
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.960]   per inch that it just feels a lot crisper.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   It feels a lot crisper.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.680]   Yeah, and the color saturation is higher, too,
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.160]   so colors look better.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.560]   But you know what I'm most excited about,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.920]   and I don't hear a lot about it.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.400]   I think the camera blows me away.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.120]   How are you using it?
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.000]   So I have a question for you.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.800]   Do you take pictures a lot with your iPad?
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.040]   Yeah, you want to see what it looks
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.000]   like when I take pictures in my iPad?
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.640]   For those of you listening, Leo has the cover of the iPad.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.640]   Well, I have one of those--
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.640]   I have one of those--
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.600]   I have one of those iPad covers that-- see, the camera
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.840]   is right down here.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.320]   So normally, the cover folds over the camera,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.720]   so I have to do that.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.400]   Or you could take a picture like this, which is equally
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.040]   kind of dorky, have the cover hang down from the bottom.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.720]   But you know what?
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.520]   I think we're all going to get used to the idea.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.520]   Even when I pull it out, it still looks kind of silly.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.440]   But I think we're all going to get used to the idea.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.480]   Because it is essentially the same sensor, I guess,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.560]   in the iPhone 4 with a lens system from the iPhone 4S.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.280]   But it is so good.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.680]   It really is so good.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.280]   And what's exciting about it is you're seeing the image--
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.440]   it's like a view camera.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:15.960]   That's cool.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.560]   Remember the old days when on the three Stooges
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.680]   or the Wild West movies, they'd have a guy,
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.040]   and he'd have the thing on the tripod,
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.920]   and he'd put a black hood over his head and say,
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.360]   watch the birdie.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.200]   And this is-- you could almost do that, put a hood over your head.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.120]   And because now you're seeing a full frame rendition
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:33.720]   of the picture.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.600]   Well, not the point was made is when have you ever
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.760]   been able to take the video with the same view as it will be--
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.240]   Exactly.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.440]   --consistent view.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   Exactly.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.680]   And so as a result, I think it is a remarkable experience
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   for a videographer or photographer.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.400]   And then you add to that that this has got LTE, which is really fast.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.880]   And you've got great software on it.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.000]   I think that in some ways the camera might be, to me,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.560]   the most exciting part of this.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.400]   I really like--
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.880]   So that sounds interesting.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.200]   Everything--
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:01.680]   Go ahead, Jen.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.180]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:02.760]   No, no, no, go ahead.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.080]   I say that's interesting because I just
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.040]   finished writing my review.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.520]   I've written a number of pieces on the iPad this past week.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.880]   And I wanted to take some time and write the review.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.080]   So the review will be up tomorrow.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.880]   But I come to the conclusion.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.640]   And I don't want to--
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.400]   it's the conclusion everyone else has come to, which is really
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.400]   that the screen is the biggest part.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.520]   But that other biggest improvement is the camera.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   But I'm not sure a lot of people buy a new iPad for a camera.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.760]   But it's funny.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.560]   I've been hearing that a few people just
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.120]   don't really see the improvement in the screen.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.960]   It's not as dramatic as I expected it to be.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.960]   Playing the role of John C. Devorak, I will step in and say--
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.400]   What do you think?
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.360]   Do you sing it for the first time?
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:37.840]   What do you think?
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.400]   This is the first moment I've laid eyes on.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.920]   I know exactly what the specs are.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.040]   I know everything about it.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.960]   And that expression that you just had there--
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.400]   That's your opinion?
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.880]   I don't know.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.080]   The camera function's cool.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.920]   Am I going to use this?
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.920]   I'm a video creator.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.120]   Am I going to run around and make videos on this
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.680]   and send them off via LTE?
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.200]   No.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.720]   Because I can't depend on it.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.000]   Is this cool?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.160]   If I didn't have one, yeah.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.000]   If I was upgrading from one, maybe.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.720]   Is this going to make me upgrade from two?
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.080]   Absolutely not.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.480]   Here's some video that I shot.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   That's the end of the video.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.600]   Very good video.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:08.920]   Wow.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.600]   OK, that looks cool.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.760]   It's nice.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.680]   It's very-- this is walking around.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.440]   The other thing is it's a little more stable because of its size
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.680]   than a little mini camera or your smartphone.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.480]   Right.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.400]   Yeah, no, I think they're incrementally improving
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.600]   the product.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.640]   But I'm with Becky.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.000]   I'm not going to upgrade from an iPad 2 to get this device.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.320]   Iterative, not innovative.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.120]   And the teardown was interesting that big battery, huge battery
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.640]   in there.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.960]   I think it's going to be a 45-- I think 45 watt hours from 25.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.800]   And you need to, obviously, for LTE.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   I think that's more for LTE than it is for the screen,
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.280]   although we don't know that it's got a much faster processor
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.360]   and a much, of course, more dense screen.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.440]   But I was wondering in the Wi-Fi only versions,
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.480]   do you get a boost then?
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.880]   No, I'm actually-- I'm in the corner of my apartment right now
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   running a battery test.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.200]   I'm running the same HD video on both the iPad 2
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.640]   and the iPad 3.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.040]   And I expect that the iPad 2 will last probably a little bit
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.320]   longer or around the same amount of time as the iPad.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.920]   And I have LTE off, the new iPad.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.440]   I have LTE off just running on Wi-Fi
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.120]   because I expect that the screen--
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.040]   they've boosted the battery just to give you just as much
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.320]   as you would get on Wi-Fi on the iPad 2 because of the screen.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.680]   Yeah, I think we're saying--
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.360]   so it's not the LTE that it is the screen that's
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.480]   sucking all that juice.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.800]   All right, well, that makes sense.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.160]   One more-- I said you'll get hour or less with LTE on.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.680]   Right.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.360]   So you boosted the battery just to compensate enough
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.160]   for that screen.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.720]   Wow, so I was completely wrong.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.880]   It is the screen that's sucking all that juice.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.440]   LTE is notorious for being a battery hog.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.600]   But that's 10% more.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.160]   If it's only one hour, it's going from 10 hours to nine hours.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.320]   That's not a huge--
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:53.880]   Not bad.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.480]   One more point on the teardown--
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:00.040]   $4.99 retail price estimated cost to build at $3.16.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:00.880]   Does that sound about right?
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.400]   That's more than the old one.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.080]   But that's a decent profit margin.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.120]   I think Apple would like more.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.160]   But of course, I'm sure they make more if you buy the LTE
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.280]   or you buy more RAM.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.640]   Right.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.960]   Also in the teardown, we're finding that it has--
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.520]   let's see.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.440]   The A5-- I guess we knew everything else.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.480]   So it's really the battery size that's new information.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.240]   It didn't seem like there were any shockers on the fire--
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:24.680]   Nothing shockers.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.760]   --on the VFX in there and so forth.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.000]   Yeah, the funny thing was--
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   They also found that there was one gig of RAM, which Apple
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.200]   hadn't confirmed.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.320]   Same thing with the Apple TV.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.280]   It's now 512 instead of 256.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280]   They doubled the RAM there too.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.160]   And Apple never talks about RAM, which
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.960]   is part of this post-PC strategy.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.360]   We shouldn't have to talk about that stuff.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.440]   It's back on the issue.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.200]   It's just about performance, user quality--
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:44.680]   Can it work?
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.120]   --qualitative, not quantitative.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.040]   The funny thing about this release
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.840]   is before I went on vacation, I went out and recorded
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.440]   from my Yahoo show all the wraps for the new announcement.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.320]   So it was the new iPads here, the iPad 3 is here.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:58.960]   This was before they said--
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:58.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.600]   --you didn't know.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.320]   iPad HD.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.520]   You had to go through all the names.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.200]   The iPad HD is here.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.960]   And then I did--
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.800]   Were you smart enough to say just iPad?
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.760]   Yes, I did the new iPad.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.640]   I was so stoked.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.840]   And then the best one was the A5Xs
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.040]   that that had come out.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.920]   Every single thing that was out was almost--
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.200]   There were no surprises.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.160]   It was absolutely as predicted.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.560]   So--
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.520]   Wow.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.280]   You should have let me know, because that would have really
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.680]   helped with Search Placement, if we had all known the name.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.320]   Well, next time I will bring my--
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:34.160]   Because I kept calling it the iPad 3 or the iPad HD.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.640]   And that was just totally wrong.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.800]   I still need to call it the iPad 3,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.760]   because if you just say the iPad, it's ambiguous,
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.800]   especially since Apple still sells the iPad 2.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.160]   But going back to your spec point,
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.080]   they wanted to be qualitative, not quantitative.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.440]   So new is good enough.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.440]   It's all just the iPad.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.200]   First thing I called it the iPad new.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.600]   It rhymes so well with iPad 2.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.200]   iPad new.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.040]   But then what happens next year?
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.400]   The iPad not so new?
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.080]   Next.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.600]   Newer.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.400]   The next new.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   Newest?
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.800]   What do you think Denise?
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.040]   This strikes me as a strange choice.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.880]   It does.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.600]   I can't tell you they didn't consult with me, so--
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.440]   It's certainly the stock market didn't mind.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.480]   The price broke $600 this week for the first time ever.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.640]   Again, Apple, the most valuable company in the world,
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.800]   based on stock price.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.520]   Don't you just keep saying it can't keep going up.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.600]   I feel foolish for having such negativity
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.200]   about the possibility.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.920]   And then at some point, everyone's going to go, OK,
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.120]   it can go sky's limit, whatever, trillion bucks, no problem.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.520]   That's what they're talking about.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:37.960]   What is it?
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.160]   $700 billion they're worth now?
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.720]   They're saying, you know, we could be worth a trillion.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.240]   I remember when Apple was extoked--
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.320]   this is how old I am-- because they were a $2 billion company.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.600]   Wow.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.960]   I remember when we were talking about stock price on Mac Break
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.920]   Weekly, we said, well, it might hit $200,
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.840]   but I'm sure won't go much higher than that.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.680]   Scott former saying it.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.560]   It'll go higher.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.160]   It could go to $250.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.440]   And I thought you're crazy.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.000]   So now--
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.600]   It's just an interesting point that Mike Elgin said
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.840]   that the next generation of Bluetooth on this device
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.000]   is actually a big deal.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.200]   Oh.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.320]   Can someone explain that to me?
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.440]   Everyone's like the Bluetooth 4.0 is amazing.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.920]   That's the big deal.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.080]   I know nothing.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.760]   Is it--
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.320]   I haven't tried it yet.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.400]   I mean, do you really use Bluetooth on a tablet?
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.720]   Well, for keyboards.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.240]   Ah.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.640]   Keyboard for your car.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.880]   I suppose.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.520]   To have a few words.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.240]   You could have that synced.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.680]   Synet saying it's a game changer.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.040]   The first Bluetooth smart ready device
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.040]   allowing it to connect with the billions of Bluetooth
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.560]   devices and the next generation.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.000]   It's such a great satellite.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.800]   That's the issue.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.200]   It's the next generation, I guess.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.680]   Yeah, I know.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.320]   That's silver light.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.320]   Just never-- I never can keep it quite up to date, can I?
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.280]   So apparently, CNBC right now is announcing or reporting
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.280]   that Apple is going to make an announcement tomorrow morning
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.120]   at 9 AM about the company's cash balance.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.400]   They say this is breaking.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.560]   Yes, this is breaking news.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.360]   And I was just about to say it.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.560]   The question is, what would the announcement be?
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.240]   Is it evident?
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.440]   They have $100 billion.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.720]   They were expected-- or it was hoped by some,
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.080]   I think that the stockholders mean that they would offer a dividend.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.360]   And of course, they didn't.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.840]   They've never offered a dividend.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.960]   It's got to be.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.160]   You think it's a dividend or you're
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.680]   going to announce that they're going to buy the planet Earth?
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.480]   Maybe just Italy.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.160]   Well, they could just buy Italy.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:24.660]   OK.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.560]   Tim Cook could say, you know, I've always loved Italy.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.320]   I love the food.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:27.840]   I love the wine.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.000]   I love the people.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Let's just buy Italy.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.400]   Right.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.360]   That would be obvious sense.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.160]   We could call it Apple-y.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:34.660]   OK.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.840]   I'm saying Apple--
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.920]   To rival Italy.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.640]   --in Apple-y and old and dense.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.000]   I'm going to back into this American life story with this little
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.500]   point.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.480]   Yes, back it up.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   Back it up.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.200]   So here's the--
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.720]   Exactly.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.800]   There's a story that we'll talk much about,
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.480]   which is this American life retracting the episode--
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.560]   You can talk about it right now.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.200]   --about Apple and the Apple factories.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.880]   But the last act of the episode talking about this thing
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.680]   said that Apple could build their devices in the US,
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   the iPhone, for $60 more.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.280]   That was the study that came out about a year ago.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.280]   It was-- it's not-- you know, people might say,
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.960]   oh, it's going to be twice as much.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.120]   Or it's going to be--
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.480]   you know, no, it's a--
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.720]   it's not a significant difference.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.280]   Because they only pay about $5 to the workers in China
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.640]   to make that device.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.680]   So they pay $65 to US workers.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.200]   Done.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.840]   And the supply chain has commoditized
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.320]   that it's-- you know, labor isn't that much of a big deal
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.240]   in terms of changing it.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.560]   So my crazy out there is Apple's building factories in the US,
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.200]   and they're going to--
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.160]   $100 billion.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.560]   That'll build a few factories.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.080]   And you know what?
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.560]   That would be great PR.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.960]   That would be great.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.480]   That would be--
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.800]   And I hope she's right.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.720]   It's so outrageous.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.440]   I'm so wrong.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.680]   But that's just like my crazy--
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.180]   No.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.560]   I love that idea.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560]   That is a great idea.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.960]   It's good for America.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.280]   Good for American workers.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.720]   It solves the problem--
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.560]   this embarrassment with Foxconn.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.440]   I think you're brilliant.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.040]   Let's do it.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.200]   There is a problem.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.440]   There is a problem.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.520]   There aren't enough workers.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.240]   No, it's the supply chain.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.800]   It's getting the stuff into China.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.680]   I mean, out of China.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.960]   It's the flexibility.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.760]   This was the point they made in the episode.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.200]   It's just in time manufacturing.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   It's like, hey, guys, down the street in, you know,
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.840]   screw factory or that didn't come out right.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.540]   In--
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.980]   There's a factory for that?
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.380]   In glass factory or, you know, bracket factory.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.460]   Can you make 50 million more of these
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.260]   and get them to us by tomorrow?
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.460]   Well, they might have to build some of those factories here.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.180]   So anyways, that's my cookie end around that I think
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.540]   that that's my wild idea or dividend.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.300]   But--
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.900]   I like the idea of building factories here.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.380]   How could-- that's a win everywhere.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.940]   Now remember Steve Jobs when he went to that famous dinner
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.200]   and talked about in the Walter Isaacson biography
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.720]   with Mark Zuckerberg and many other Silicon Valley
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.160]   luminaries.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.620]   The one thing that Jobs brought up with Obama is, you know,
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.460]   it's-- there's too many regulations for me
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.100]   to build a factory here.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.100]   But remember, in the early days of Apple,
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.700]   they did make MacIntoshes here.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.860]   They did make Apple twos here.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.500]   They-- this is a more recent development, offshore,
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.800]   the manufacturer.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   Steve was very proud of the next factory
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   where they built the cube.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   Right.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   The built here in America.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.320]   What was that designed in California was weird.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.360]   I mean, that's great.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:26.920]   That's super.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.520]   But I prefer made in America.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.440]   I'm-- and that's-- I don't know.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.560]   Yeah, my design in California made by slaves in China.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.800]   Doesn't have the same ring to it.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.480]   New.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   Somehow.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.200]   Something like a wonderful, warm, 8-bit fire
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.720]   matter, beautiful holiday eve.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.200]   I hope you had a great Christmas, great Hanukkah.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.560]   Your Festivus was the best of us.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.600]   And you're enjoying your winter solstice activities.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.160]   New Year's is coming.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.960]   And as we always do, we're doing a best-of-twit this year,
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.480]   looking back at the year 2012 in some of our best episodes.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.600]   More to come in just a moment.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.400]   Before we do, though, I'd like to thank one of our sponsors
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.920]   who's also been with us all year long.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.600]   In fact, one of my favorite companies,
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.080]   a good friends with a guy who started at David Friend,
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.440]   he's an interesting character.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:17.940]   I don't know.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.040]   You remember ARP synthesizers?
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.520]   He started ARP.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.240]   Made a lot of money there right out of college.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.160]   I think he was at MIT right out of college.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.080]   David went on to do many other startups.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.360]   But he was kind of retired, taking it easy.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.440]   When his daughter, who was a college student, called him up
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.560]   and said, Daddy, I just accidentally erased my thesis.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.440]   You're a geek.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.200]   Can you help me?
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.280]   And he said, I can't.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.400]   I have no solution for this.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.120]   And that's why he founded Carbonite.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.000]   He said, there's got to be a better way to back up.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.960]   And Carbonite is the better way to back up.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   Here's the beauty of it.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.640]   It's automatic.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.240]   I put it on my daughter's laptop when she went to college.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.200]   Kind of went full circle on that.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   So she didn't have to even know that there was a backup
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:57.960]   solution on there.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.680]   It just automatically is backing up continuously, too.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.440]   So she puts the finishing touches on a term paper.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.120]   Within minutes, that's packed up.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.960]   Whenever you're online, Carbonite is always backing up
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.520]   without slowing you down or your computer down.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.800]   And the nice thing is this Carbonite date is available at any
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.120]   time.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.240]   So you've got your term paper backed up.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.160]   You go to the library.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.360]   You don't bring your laptop with you.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   You can still open the term paper on the library computer.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.080]   Just log into your Carbonite account.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.520]   And there's all your stuff.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.360]   You can even do it on a smartphone or a tablet.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.040]   Carbonite has a free apps there.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.120]   It's a really great deal.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.440]   And all of this is just $59 a year per computer.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.960]   That's less than $5 a month.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.560]   I would really encourage you to try Carbonite today.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.560]   Go to Carbonite.com.

[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   Let's make 2013 the year that nobody lost any data.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.240]   Wouldn't that be something?
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.600]   So normally I wouldn't recommend taking stock advice from
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.960]   former MTV VJs.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.480]   But in this case, Adam Curry got it right.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.320]   We talked about Facebook's IPO.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.280]   And this is before it even happened.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.600]   Oh, quick.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:27.040]   Reload the fireplace while we watch Adam Curry.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.680]   I do want to talk about the Facebook IPO.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.800]   That's the reason we've gathered you all together today.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.880]   Because--
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.680]   And the Zuck got married.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.960]   I guess Priscilla Chan, who's been dating since before
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.880]   Facebook, has since a freshman in Harvard, Priscilla finally
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.920]   said, oh, you're worth $19 billion.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.440]   I'll marry you.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.600]   No problem, Mark.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.200]   What do they wait?
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.920]   They wait until the day after the IPO.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.720]   How about this?
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.400]   Oh, man.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.000]   We got to do something to distract from that failed
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   IPO.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.160]   Don't care.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   You can get married too.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.440]   How do you make some headlines?
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.200]   I want to fill an IPO that's worth $105 billion.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   Let's talk.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.040]   I already--
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:10.560]   Zuck.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.840]   It's going to be Zuckerberg changes his status to married.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.280]   It's an interesting question.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.520]   Is it a failed IPO?
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.920]   We'll talk about it in just a second.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   The Facebook IPO--
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.120]   and here it is, the lovely vision of Mark, the $19 billion
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.400]   man and his new bride, Priscilla Chan.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.560]   They got married yesterday in a surprise.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.360]   They invited people to the wedding and said it was a--
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.840]   what was it-- it was like her graduation party.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.840]   And then instead, she shows up in white.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.640]   She's graduating from Spinstourhood.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.240]   We're going to take a break.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.120]   Come back with more.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.360]   Adam Curry.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.200]   Actually, it's the podfather, the godfather,
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.760]   and the scobalizer.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.480]   That works for me.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.520]   That doesn't make it.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.480]   One of these things is not like the other.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.680]   So really interesting here you say a Facebook failed IPO,
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:36:59.960]   Adam.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.280]   And I'm not sure I disagree with you.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.840]   The underwriters decided to set the price before the IPO
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.600]   yesterday morning at $38.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.640]   That was the price that if you were an insider,
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.720]   like you were a big trader with your brokerage,
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.160]   you could say, hey, cut me some of that Facebook stock.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.320]   And it's the biggest tech IPO in history.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.760]   It wouldn't be unreasonable to think
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.360]   it's going to what they call pop, which is come out
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.640]   at $38, but end up at $100 or $50 or whatever.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.040]   And then even if you just wanted to sell at the end of the day,
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.400]   it'd make pretty good money.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.720]   So I took my company public in '96.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.000]   Oh, you've done this.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.720]   Yeah, I have.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.440]   And that was a huge IPO, a big raise, $15 million.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.200]   It was amazingly large.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.000]   Was this metaverse?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.960]   No, this was think new ideas.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.360]   Oh, OK.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.120]   And which we later sold successfully
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.080]   to another public-realisted company
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.640]   like two months before the bubble burst.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.400]   Yeah, you were in the bubble.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.960]   You were in the bubble.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.840]   Well, '96 was a little bit before it.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.880]   And we had-- we were making money, which was good.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.520]   We had clients.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.200]   But it was back in the day when we'll
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.240]   build a Reebok's website for $100,000.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.480]   I mean, yeah, and then $10,000 a month maintenance.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.440]   We saw the writing on the wall eventually.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.360]   But I went through the process of taking a company public.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:27.200]   And what it really comes down to is pricing the night before.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.200]   And so it's the size of the flow, the number of shares,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.400]   and what the actual price per share is going to be.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.160]   And I think they got greedy when investors--
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.520]   and of course, there was a lot of--
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.360]   more interesting to me was the coverage of the IPO,
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.040]   because you saw the day before--
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.120]   Oh, it was the mouth.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.440]   Super bowl.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.840]   And then we're GM tanked them.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.040]   Well, I think it had to do with it.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.240]   But if you look at right now, they're trading 74--
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.600]   almost 75 times earnings.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.160]   That's very, very high.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.760]   I mean, I'm pegging the stock to go down to 17.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.000]   That's where I think it belongs.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.160]   I think that's reasonable for what they've shown historically
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.320]   in revenues and profits.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.600]   So that's the problem.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.800]   You know, I was watching-- it was really
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.280]   treated like the Super Bowl.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.640]   I got up at 5.30 AM to watch CNBC,
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.000]   because it was like a big event.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.440]   They had reporters down at Hackers Square
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.960]   at the Facebook thing.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.600]   And of course, Facebook was smart.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.040]   They had the Hackathon the night before.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.200]   So there were thousands of employees there.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.400]   Zuck spoke.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.640]   They hooked up the Nasdaq Bell there in Silicon Valley.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.720]   So he could press the--
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.040]   there's no bell for Nasdaq.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.120]   It doesn't have a trading floor.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.680]   But he pressed the button and he started the trading day.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.600]   And--
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.920]   Then it took another half an hour.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.600]   And then a little later, they started selling.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.800]   So here's a problem with these IPOs.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.560]   And yes, I saw this in the bubble.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.120]   So you have people who came into the company recently
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.000]   beginning options.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Their strike price is going to be maybe a little bit
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.200]   under $38.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.440]   Any new hires that come in, you can't just reshuffle
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.160]   the option pool.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.240]   That's a big deal.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   They have a strike price.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.600]   And let's say just for argument's sake,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.720]   it's going to be around that $38 number.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.920]   So now people are going to be very worried, like, oh, you know,
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.840]   either I have stock or I'm in lockup for six months.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.120]   I can't sell anything.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   So on paper, I may look like I have $1 million.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   But every day, it's going to be like, oh, how's the stock doing?
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:17.680]   How's the stock going?
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.480]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.320]   It's huge distractions.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.600]   That's really what you don't want.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.160]   Particularly when it's going down,
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.120]   it really, really hurts the company.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.920]   And I think that's what we'll see with Facebook.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.440]   I think that's BS.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.600]   At Rackspace, when we went IPO, the stock went down.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.120]   And it didn't distract us.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.720]   And the stock since then has gone up 10, I think,
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.280]   about 10 times.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.640]   Just to go out IPO, you're trying to raise money
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.640]   for the company.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.040]   Yeah, let me let me understand this.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:44.760]   So do this.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.920]   So do this.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.280]   $38 bucks, that is what they decided to sell it for.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.240]   Is all of that money go to Facebook?
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.240]   Is that like what-- so Facebook said,
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.440]   we're going to have--
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:55.920]   how many shares?
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.880]   Almost a million shares, right?
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.640]   $38 bucks.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.440]   I forgot what it was.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.560]   The total number shares.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.760]   Well, not the entire amount, because the insider's sold.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.680]   So a portion of that went to--
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.080]   a large portion, of course, went to the people who sold the stock.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.280]   That's actually an important point.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   Some of these guys are making money right away.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.760]   Like they got a check.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.640]   All the underwriters made a ton of money.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.120]   Peter Thiel, for instance.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.720]   Who famously invested-- was the first investor in Facebook
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.200]   who invested half a million, ended up with $848 million
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.240]   on Friday.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.000]   And he still has another $852 million shares,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.520]   a dollar's worth of shares, a current price remaining.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.720]   But this gives-- this is--
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.840]   this is not made one and a half billion in cash, right?
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.680]   Like that.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.920]   And he still has $19 billion outstanding.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.720]   If I could take a contrarian position here,
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.200]   I mean, I know why people are saying this is a bust,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.320]   because they're expecting for the price to double.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.480]   To go back to the good old days of the bubble,
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.000]   when you would have an incredible rise in the stock price.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.960]   And the IPO was when people get paid.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.880]   This is not a regular IPO.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:02.120]   You're talking about a company that is 57% owned by a single man.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.560]   All you wanted was operating capital for his company.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.920]   I don't think he even needed to do this.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.040]   I think the SEC rules made him do this.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.080]   Well, at least they made him disclose to a certain point.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.400]   And I think they figured well, as long as we have to do all
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.920]   the disclosure, a public company has to do,
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.520]   we might as well raise money on the stock market.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.480]   But I don't think that this was, I think they put it off
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.640]   as long as they could, right?
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.560]   They could have done this a year ago.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.200]   They could have done this two years ago.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.360]   Partly that's hype.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.400]   Because you don't think so?
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.720]   I think Mark didn't want to put it in.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.960]   You know Mark better than anybody.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.920]   I think he put it off to raise the price.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.120]   He wanted to make as much as he could.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.040]   Every minute that Facebook is out there,
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   the price goes down.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:35.880]   Risky game though.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.200]   It is a risky game, but he also got down.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.040]   It paid off.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.480]   He collected $104 billion on Friday
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.480]   for his investors and his company.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.760]   Now, I mean, on Friday night, what did he do?
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.480]   He went and bought a mobile company called Karma, right?
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.960]   He's going to have the resources to take over a lot of things.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:54.480]   Right.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.480]   And this is very good for Facebook.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.600]   Also, on the other side, the transparency is going to force
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.880]   Facebook to be an adult company for once.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.600]   I think that's what Mark didn't want though.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.560]   No, I think he does.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.080]   He did.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.960]   I think he does.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.400]   You know, he knows he's moving his company
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.960]   into being a brand that everybody respects and trusts.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.960]   Those two words are not used with Facebook today.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.840]   Well, in fact, with GM pulling out,
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.800]   it's $10 million worth of advertising,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.840]   which is not a huge amount.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.640]   But GM pulled out the Super Bowl, too.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.640]   Is the Super Bowl dead?
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.080]   In fact, I think it's more of a common on GM's inability
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.280]   to use these markets appropriately than it is a common
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:29.880]   on the use of the--
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.240]   And more interesting is, though, is how do they actually
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.600]   make money?
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.240]   If you have a so-called 900 million people,
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.080]   which I don't believe is correct,
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.560]   I think it's probably a fraction of that.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.720]   But I'll go, really?
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.480]   That's neither-- yeah, I think that everyone
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.480]   has multiple accounts.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.800]   The SEO guys have 50 accounts.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   It's just a matter of how you count things.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.840]   But in the case of Rackspace, Robert,
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.040]   that's a business where you're providing a service
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:54.960]   and people pay for it.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   I have five Rackspace servers.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.240]   I love the servers.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:58.560]   I have them.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.200]   Amazon S3 servers, EC2.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.360]   But we have yet to show that you can really
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.760]   place a good value on essentially display banner advertising.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.200]   That's all they've got so far.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.520]   And quite honestly, for the company
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.400]   that knows so much about the social graph,
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:18.760]   how could they not figure out that this IPO was mispriced?
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.080]   They should have had all the information at their fingertips.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.320]   Was it mispriced, though?
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.040]   They announced it at $38.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.920]   And it came out at $38.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.400]   If they came out at $17 and went to $38,
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.680]   they would have not left money on the table.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.920]   The purpose of doing an IPO is to raise money
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.360]   for your investor and company.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.520]   You can't disagree, Adam.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.360]   They raised the most money that they possibly
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.120]   could have raised, right?
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.320]   But it kept hitting $38 because the underwriters
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.560]   were buying stock like crazy to keep it above $38.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.480]   They kept it at $38, you think?
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.520]   OK, on Monday it'll go down.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.800]   And because they can't do that forever.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.400]   But they took the most amount of money off the table
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.560]   that they possibly could.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.160]   There was some--
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.120]   Should have been a $37 or $35, maybe.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.600]   But--
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.640]   It's $120-- price to earnings ratio is $122.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.400]   This is not a normal IPO.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.120]   This is not a--
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.760]   It means that the stock price is 122 times what they earn.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.000]   That's crazy.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.880]   And one of the reasons-- and now I'm watching CNBC and Jim
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.600]   Kramer, who was actually great on this.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.320]   And I was surprised because he's kind of crazy.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.200]   But he was great on it.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.320]   He said, well, what you can't account for
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.000]   is what's going to happen with the retail sales.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.080]   You know the institutional investors pushed back
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:29.920]   about this price.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.480]   But there was some concern that everybody who loves--
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.760]   all the kids who love Facebook would just say, well,
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.440]   I don't know anything about the stock market or price
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.160]   to earnings, but I want to buy Facebook.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.720]   It's a good-- and would buy it.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.440]   And that's what the thought was that this would pop that would
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.240]   go up to $50 because-- and you know what?
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.000]   The kids or whoever did not fall for this,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.640]   they looked-- somebody looked at the price to earnings.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.440]   Or somebody fell for it.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.640]   And said, it's too high.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.200]   Well, it came back--
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:53.680]   Somebody fell for it.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.760]   It still is.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.280]   It went up to $440--
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.600]   It went up to $4,000 right now.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.200]   It went up to $4,000.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.480]   This is the largest IPO of history.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.160]   It's not a GM when they went out with their recent IPO.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.680]   It's Facebook worth more than Citigroup.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.720]   Yes.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.640]   It's worth more than these other companies, really.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.560]   Yes.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.600]   We look at Facebook all day long.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.600]   We're addicted to it.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.000]   And we're going to get more addicted to it.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.080]   But I think how often do you click on an ad, Robert?
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.880]   I click on a lot of ads, but I'm playing around with it.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.640]   The ads that are going to come are going to be on mobile.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.080]   He's making him $0 on mobile right now.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.080]   And I can see a lot-- and by the way, some of these--
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:27.600]   More than ads?
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.120]   --that I bought a lot of stock.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.680]   I don't know any stock in this company.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.920]   Oh, we should say right now.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.080]   Who owns Facebook stock here?
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.000]   I don't know any.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   I don't.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:34.920]   I can't afford it.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.420]   OK.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.760]   So just so you know, we don't buy tech stock.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.400]   I don't buy tech stock.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:38.960]   I might buy this summer.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.160]   I'm here by tech stock.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.100]   The time really to buy it for normal people, to buy Facebook,
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.880]   is right after the Google I/O conference,
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.320]   because that's going to be where it gets--
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.360]   either get slammed because Google's going to announce something,
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.600]   or it's going to start rising or do whatever.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.600]   But at that point, then that's where--
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.400]   But how do you answer Adam's criticism
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.800]   that Facebook's revenue right now is banner ads, display ads,
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.400]   which don't work?
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.280]   He's absolutely right.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.600]   But that's about the story, right?
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.440]   That's why he needs to--
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.400]   You can click on ads.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.980]   So they can get more drunk people away.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.980]   I don't think it's about clicking on ads anyways.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.700]   So when people are investing in Facebook,
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.020]   there's a presumption that well--
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:11.940]   OK, wait, wait, wait.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.340]   This is-- the fundamentals of this company
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.820]   are going to be good because Zuck is smart,
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:15.940]   and he's going to figure out mobile.
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.500]   Coca-Cola owns a sign in downtown San Francisco
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.420]   that costs, I don't know, $200,000 a month,
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:20.900]   something like that.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:22.940]   But they're selling sugar water.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.220]   But why do they do that?
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.300]   Is it because you go up to the sign and click on it?
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:26.780]   No.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.580]   It's there on the side, and it reminds you
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.100]   that Coca-Cola exists.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.780]   This is why advertising is done.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.480]   This is why Stamps.com bought an ad on your show
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.760]   to remind people that they exist.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.720]   I mean, one of the things--
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.480]   It's not all about clicks.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.920]   This is not a regular IPO.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.480]   Stamps.com is not necessarily branding.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.040]   Part of it's branding, but it's also per inquiry.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.160]   So there's a call to action.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.800]   You need to either put in a code.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.640]   All the ads work that way.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.680]   I think the only brand advertiser is Ford possibly,
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.440]   and they're making a connection with the tech savvy audience.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.740]   It's not exactly the same.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.740]   And again, Coca-Cola sells an actual product.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.020]   People take money out of their pocket
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.700]   and hand it to the company.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.260]   This is the difference.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.780]   I mean, we've been through this.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.100]   We've seen the banner advertising.
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:15.860]   It's marginal.
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.780]   And how do you grow if you really have 900 million people?
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.540]   How do you scale?
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.700]   How much bigger can you go?
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.900]   All of a sudden, you're going to make five times as much
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.740]   from each person?
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.420]   Yes, because they're making zero on mobile.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.180]   And there's hundreds of millions of people
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.640]   who only use Facebook on mobile.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.600]   All they have to make is a couple of bucks per user.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.420]   Maybe it's not 900 million, as you say, Adam.
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.120]   Maybe it's, let's say, what would you stipulate?
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.320]   150 million.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.520]   140 million, I'd say.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.600]   So all they have to do is make 10 bucks per person per year
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.400]   to justify their stock price.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.240]   Could they do?
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.200]   Can you make 10 bucks per person per year?
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.640]   You can with the money that you just raised in the IPO.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.880]   I mean, again--
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.240]   You mean spending that money, acquisitions?
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.700]   Spending that money in acquisitions and in development.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.260]   I mean, one of the things that we keep forgetting is,
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.380]   this is not a regular IPO.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.100]   If this had been another LinkedIn,
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.860]   or if this had been another Groupon, absolutely,
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:10.980]   this was a bust.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.300]   But this was a man who, by all means,
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.620]   has done very well for his company.
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.380]   Getting money for him to be able to invest in his money
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.460]   so he can leverage those 900 million users.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.540]   So you're buying-- you're not buying stock at Facebook.
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.620]   You're buying stock at Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.300]   Well, right now it's a rational.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.540]   I totally agree with Adam that the price is completely crazy
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:30.080]   right now.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.280]   And it's crazy because we all use Facebook all day long.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:33.800]   They're using it.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.600]   We buy brands.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.720]   We buy stock.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.360]   Adam and you--
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:36.700]   That we use it--
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.200]   You're an outlier.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.840]   Me, possibly.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.520]   But I do have an account.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.600]   I only use it to see what my daughter's doing
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.880]   and to terrorize her friends.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.840]   I love doing that.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.520]   That's a lot of fun.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.320]   That's not a bad response.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.440]   I could reason that.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.000]   You know, people are saying, no, we don't.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.400]   OK, I just was recently at Disney World.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.320]   And I walked around.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.420]   And I looked at what people were doing on their phones.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.540]   70% were on Facebook.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.340]   Walking around--
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.980]   People clearly use Facebook.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.660]   There's no question about that.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.540]   I think when you buy Facebook--
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:06.260]   You buy Facebook internet.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:06.700]   No, no, but--
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.700]   It's a different thing.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:08.540]   People use Google.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:09.780]   Google's making money.
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:10.980]   Google's a valuable stock.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:11.780]   It's $600.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.660]   I don't think the PDE is the same.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.740]   So the question is, can Mark figure out a way?
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.060]   I think you're betting that Mark will make some magic
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.580]   and figure out a way to make money on mobile.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.660]   And I don't think it's too--
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.500]   you don't have to think too hard to think of a way--
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.900]   or many ways he could make money on mobile.
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:25.600]   Here's how.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.320]   Here's how.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.720]   I'm looking at Flipboard.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.400]   I'm looking at a Giga-Ome article in Flipboard.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.280]   And when I page through this--
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.160]   whoa, there's a Polycom ad, a full page ad--
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.920]   And that goes by the way, not to Flipboard, but to Gigo-Ome,
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.200]   right?
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:38.760]   Yes.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.880]   That's a Gigo-Ome ad.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.440]   Gigo-Ome is sharing a revenue with Flipboard, right?
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.960]   And then you turn the page and you're back to Gigo-Ome.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.640]   This is not ad--
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.200]   You know what?
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.000]   I'll be honest.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.680]   I just skip it real quick.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.040]   But these are ads like Wired Magazine has.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:52.880]   And it's why don't things--
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.600]   Well, I don't think those work.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.880]   I think those don't work either.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.580]   They work enough for people to keep doing them
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.260]   and have been doing them for years, right?
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:00.760]   OK.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.020]   OK.
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.340]   I think we can agree.
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:05.060]   The stock price was too high, not for Facebook,
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.220]   but for investors.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.980]   Facebook was just right, because they made a lot of money.
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.100]   The question is, next week, what's the stock price?
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.100]   What's your target price, Adam, for Facebook in a week,
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.900]   in a month, in a year?
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:17.380]   OK.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.980]   I can give you the five month and five years scenario.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.980]   Five months, the stock is at 17, five years.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.780]   We're not talking about Facebook anymore.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:25.580]   It's something else.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.360]   It's not a long-term hold.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.380]   No.
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.980]   You're assured on Facebook--
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.380]   Leo, we've seen this movie.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.180]   Look at what does AOL become?
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:37.580]   Now it's a giant Xerox machine run by Ariana Huffington.
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:38.880]   I mean, we've seen Geo City film in my face.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.520]   I think you're not in my face.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.360]   Adam, I think you're--
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:41.860]   Adam, I think you're--
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:42.360]   Adam, I think you're--
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:42.860]   --right.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.760]   What a great characterization of AOL.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.660]   Adam, what is it?
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:46.660]   I think--
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.120]   I think it's exactly right.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.300]   I think Adam is correct on one of the predictions,
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.180]   which is short term.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.620]   I see it going down.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.640]   Long term.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.760]   He is going to turn on mobile revenue.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.120]   And for the next five quarters, he is going to beat his numbers,
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.240]   and that is going to cause the stock to have lift.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:01.740]   Target price.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.760]   This is what happens.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.800]   This is what happens.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.160]   And by the way, this is Zuckerberg's brilliance.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.760]   Zuckerberg knew we were all going to buy this stock coming
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.560]   out of the gate.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.160]   So he-- he--
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.720]   St-- he--
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.720]   Stagas.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.360]   He's-- he-- he-- he-- he-- he-- he-- he-- he-- he--
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.080]   he kept this revenue off the table until after--
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:18.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.400]   He's been hiding his revenue.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.760]   He's been hiding the mobile revenue.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.280]   He's been--
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.160]   He's been slow playing his hand.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.480]   He-- you watch.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.400]   By the end of summer, he's got-- he's got five aces.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.440]   I think he's going to turn on this style of mobile advertising
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.920]   over the next couple of months.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.280]   And he's probably going to turn it on right
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.920]   during the Google I/O conference,
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.840]   because Google is going to come out with a bunch of stuff
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:37.680]   for Google+.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.640]   Slap him.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.120]   Slap him around, and announce a whole bunch of new things,
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.480]   and announce a new open-ground--
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.760]   Do you know something we don't know, or is this speculations?
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.960]   I keep hearing you.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.280]   It's a little bit of speculation,
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.840]   but a little bit of informed--
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.720]   Adam, that sounds right.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.200]   I mean, there's no-- everybody would
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.640]   agree that Zuck is a sly devil, right?
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.800]   Well, I think he built a really great service,
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.000]   and-- oh, thank you, love.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.800]   That's perfect.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.200]   Perfect timing.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.640]   Did she bring you another fine differential thing?
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.280]   I needed that right about now.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.240]   This is what I always love about Daily's service code,
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.400]   by the way.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.880]   You know, wait until 30 minutes from now.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.240]   No, he built something great, but it's not part of the network.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.000]   And with the network, I mean the internet.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.840]   I do not believe in the advertising banner click model.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:28.880]   I think, yeah, if you turn it on mobile, sure.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.000]   People will misclick.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.560]   Oh, sorry.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.400]   I didn't mean to do that.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.280]   Well, I clicked on it anyway.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.480]   I just don't see the model as something that really
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.240]   works anymore.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.760]   I think it's the only way you can make money
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.600]   with banner advertising, which is essentially what they do.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.840]   I've looked at all the presentations.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.520]   I follow it.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.280]   I'm very interested.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.760]   Is high volume.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.680]   High, high volume of lots of people,
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.600]   someone who'll be drunk, someone who'll make a mistake.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.880]   Some of them will be interested, no doubt about it.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.640]   But early on brands were all sold on this,
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.160]   how many likes a brand had.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.800]   And advertisers are very, very smart.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.520]   Agencies, not so.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.000]   Agencies will sell a great crap to the advertiser.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.480]   But the advertiser at the end of the day go, hey man.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.480]   Did it make us money or not?
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.840]   They're going to turn on investments.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.080]   Very simple.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:22.560]   So are you saying that the free and open internet will return?
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.000]   Yes.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:23.320]   Oh yeah.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.760]   Well, this is the pendulum that always swings back and forth.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.120]   I think the internet--
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.680]   the internet was not meant to be centralized.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.560]   It wasn't built that way.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.800]   I think we will see mom and pops, I hope.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.960]   We'll see mom and pops popping up again who
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.760]   will provide email to 100 people, email services.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.840]   It'll be little smaller cloud things.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:52.160]   I mean, my goodness, my fiance just moved to iCloud
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.880]   and the mail's not working.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.000]   It craps out.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.400]   This is hard, hard stuff.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.040]   And the more scale you have, the harder it gets.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.480]   And if you do it in a smaller-- I run my own mail server here
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.000]   at home.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.680]   I got three accounts on it.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.520]   It's enough.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.800]   It works.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.400]   So we're going to have to go back to that.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.160]   And because of Facebook's inherent closed nature,
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.960]   it's not a part of the network.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.200]   So that's why the analogy to AOL is app,
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.320]   because that was also a walled garden
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.440]   that everybody used at--
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.120]   many people thought it was the internet.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:26.360]   Except we haven't seen all my favorite apps,
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.400]   whether it be Four Square or Spotify or--
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.880]   How much money are they making, Robert?
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:31.760]   Seriously.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.560]   Well, this is where he's going to turn on these new mobile ad
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.440]   network and--
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.760]   I would talk about Four Square and talk about Twitter.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.720]   I said making some.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.480]   Isn't that the bubble that we're in right now is that, well,
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.040]   this is location somehow going to turn a huge profit.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.520]   You can't have this many users telling you this much
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.400]   about themselves without making money on it.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.160]   And the question is how?
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.520]   And that's the big $64,000 question, Robert.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.040]   What do you think?
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.160]   If that's the answer--
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.600]   Robert's stuck out here in the left field.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.640]   Well, I mean, look, I've been hearing
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:04.760]   the end of the walled garden since the Mayas of AOL.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.560]   They keep coming back.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.400]   It keeps coming back.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.000]   We keep going to a larger walled garden.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.080]   Now, Facebook is not a MySpace.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.440]   We've already seen that.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.880]   But Facebook has--
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:14.960]   is, yes, right now they've got bad--
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.960]   They're not in MySpace.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.440]   Yes.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.160]   They're not in MySpace.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.160]   They're not in MySpace.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.840]   They had tons of ads and it didn't work for you.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.120]   And what Adam's talking about is this is perfect.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.480]   Yeah, it was only banner ads.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.080]   And banner ads died in MySpace.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.440]   But Facebook has something else.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.560]   And I'm not bringing out the mystic zuck anymore.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.840]   I'm talking about it's gone beyond a critical mass
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.640]   where you have an ecosystem, where
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.280]   you have people who are willing to buy the brand, not
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.160]   just the advertising in the site,
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.120]   but the actual brand for Facebook.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.880]   And I think you've given a man who, again,
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.240]   I think is a very intelligent, a huge war chest
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.760]   that he can now go out and get what he needs to get more money
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.160]   out of his 900 million users without it just being banner
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.040]   advertising.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.200]   I don't know what that's going to be yet.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.400]   I mean, look at Flipboard.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.680]   This is my Facebook feed.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.240]   It doesn't look like Facebook, but it's my Facebook feed.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.080]   And how does Facebook monetize that?
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.160]   Well, they can buy Flipboard.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:06.080]   And then they can put those full page ads like Gigome has
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:06.720]   right in there.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.000]   And they can have audio ads in SoundCloud.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.640]   But I think Adam's saying that the display ads don't work.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.600]   I think they do.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.680]   Otherwise, Wired magazine would not exist.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.840]   I think a lot of magazines that are gone.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.840]   A lot of magazines have disappeared, but a lot of come up.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.760]   I mean, when I go to--
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.840]   What's your main magazine circulation?
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.680]   What's its circulation?
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.560]   I don't think people do actually pay for the magazines.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.560]   I don't think you're actually--
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.800]   Yeah, I don't think you're using a very good example, Robert.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.880]   I hate to tell you.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.360]   I don't know if display ads work.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.280]   I really think that's what's going on right now.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.960]   So is there going to be--
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.480]   there still is demand from advertisers
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.680]   to get in front of your face.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.720]   Why did Stamps.com just sponsor your show?
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.400]   Well, I think Adam makes a very good point.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:51.640]   Stamps.com calculates return on their investment
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.840]   very carefully.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.840]   It's a little harder for Ford because it's a brand builder.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.560]   But you're right.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.600]   And Ford even wants to do a lot of research.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.400]   They're researching constantly to see
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.960]   if they're getting brand recognition.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.320]   So no company that's spending ad dollars
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.120]   and is intelligent is spending ad dollars into a vacuum.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:10.720]   They're checking.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.400]   Does this work?
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.960]   Does this produce results?
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.520]   One way or the other, they're not--
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.680]   and I think you're right, Adam.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.760]   I don't know if it's the agencies that are that smart.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.320]   But the advertisers, whose actual money it is,
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.480]   are very careful about where they're putting it.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.120]   And in fact, I think that's one of the reasons you're
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.680]   seeing of a real softening in banner ads right now.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.280]   Aren't we?
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.000]   Display ads are down.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:29.840]   It's horrible.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.120]   I mean, what do you get for a click these days?
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:32.520]   Nothing.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.040]   Any?
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.280]   So I think that--
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:39.240]   And that's why advertisers are starting to demand acquisition
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.040]   cost per acquisition instead of cost per click
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.240]   or cost per impression.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.640]   They really want to make sure that they're
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.080]   getting their money's worth.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.560]   So I don't-- I think it's a--
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.520]   but this was all brought up before the IPO.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.280]   Everybody said, well, here's the negatives.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.320]   It could be another MySpace.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.520]   Everybody could vacate Facebook because somebody else comes along.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.280]   They don't have and shown that they know how to produce revenue.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.800]   And they certainly aren't producing enough revenue
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.080]   to justify that price right now.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.560]   It's clear people who bought Facebook-- and by the way,
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.560]   I would buy it if I could, believe in Zuck,
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.360]   and believe in him and his team and his ability to somehow
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.320]   turn 900 million users--
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.320]   Well, and the users.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.760]   And they could say, if it's Adam's case, 900 million eyeballs.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.840]   And they're believing in their own usage model.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.000]   They're believing in their own usage model.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.960]   Well, that was the dumb retail buyers
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.800]   that Jim Kramer was worried about people who said, well, I like
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:29.080]   Facebook.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:29.760]   I like McDonald's.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.200]   I'll buy this stock without even thinking,
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.560]   is this a good value?
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:37.080]   Because that's the question is, yeah, you may like Maserati,
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.160]   but is it a million dollar car?
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.680]   Facebook's selling a million dollar car here, right?
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:45.360]   Is that what we're saying, Adam, that this is just overpriced?
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:48.760]   Well, if it was a car, it would do something for me.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:52.000]   Now, if something is thicker--
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.880]   Now there we can-- now I can really bite on you.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.600]   Facebook does do something for you.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.200]   And this helps you get laid, if nothing else.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.760]   Now, Facebook is a new--
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760]   I'm sorry, Father.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.640]   Please forgive me.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.160]   I thought that was Craigslist.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.160]   Craigslist.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.360]   It's smarter than I thought.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.000]   And it informed, eh?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   We'll do confession later.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.880]   I'll do confession songs.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.720]   Facebook is a new media company where the media comes to you
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.520]   based on who you are.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.040]   Yahoo is the old media company.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.560]   You had to go to yahoo.com/sports or yahoo.com/world.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.040]   It was a portal.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.080]   That was the portal model.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.880]   And Facebook, you just sit here and it comes--
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.480]   I mean, it's been coming to me during this show.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   Media comes to me.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.760]   What are the reasons why--
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.960]   Because I told you click on--
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.880]   --during the show.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.880]   What's that?
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.520]   How many ads did you click on during the show?
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.680]   I haven't clicked on anything.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.360]   I'm just watching it.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.920]   There's a Verizon Fiosad, right?
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.600]   At the top of the time.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.240]   I wish I could click on that Verizon Fiosad
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.760]   and buy Fiosad my house, but they don't serve it in my house
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.760]   yet.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.080]   Really?
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.120]   I like the idea that people are using Facebook.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:58.000]   I think the ability to find people
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.640]   and to have an address book of people online,
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.320]   that's the real magic sauce that Facebook provided.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.600]   Now people are doing pretty much what they always do.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.760]   Post funny pictures, quote of the day.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.080]   Here's my plate of food.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.560]   You really need to come and spend a couple hours with me
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.840]   and see what's on my screen, because I have none of that stuff
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.360]   on my screen.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.760]   You know what we need to get Ben Ha in here?
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.160]   Because if he can turn, I can has cheeseburger into money,
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.720]   then Facebook can turn its sights into money, right?
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.120]   So there's a high, high, high volume business.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.440]   Very high volume.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440]   Yeah, lots of clicks.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.400]   With extreme virality, completely open, by the way.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.320]   You don't need an account to take a look at it.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.120]   And I don't know what he's doing.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.240]   I don't know how much he's making.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.680]   I'm sure he's making enough for his company and for himself.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.320]   And I think there's validity in that.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.120]   You know, Leo, you're doing extremely well with the Twit Network,
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.040]   but I don't think you actually believe you can scale it
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.760]   to a billion dollar company.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.600]   Oh no.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.320]   And nor would you want to necessarily.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:57.800]   No.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.240]   And that I think is-- you know, there's a couple things going on
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.840]   here that are very exciting to me.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.520]   If you look at Kickstarter, there's a very interesting model
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.960]   where you have a company that's facilitating
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.480]   the connection of people and is taking a piece of the action
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.720]   and people are getting what they want.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.320]   And this is really the future.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.040]   And I think the network itself is going to facilitate
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.080]   that tremendously, where I want a product.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.760]   I want-- oh, there you go.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.760]   So they move.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.960]   $10 million on the Pebble Watch.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.280]   So you want it, and you know it's going to cost $2.99
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.040]   when it comes out.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:33.520]   But you know what?
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.440]   I want it so bad.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.360]   I'll toss these guys $50 to get it going.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.200]   This is an incredibly interesting model.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.600]   This is going to kill Hollywood and every other industry.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:46.120]   It's people-- users actually saying, I want this,
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.520]   and here's how I want it.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.240]   And I don't care who makes it for me,
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.800]   but just let's get it going.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.120]   We don't need to wait for stuff.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.080]   And here's the exact specification.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.360]   You don't think there's going to-- I think there's
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.440]   going to be Kickstarter fatigue.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.160]   The people are going to start to realize, for instance,
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.200]   I've participated four or five Kickstarter projects.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.520]   One was Diaspora, 100 bucks down the tube.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.360]   One was some dice that I never got, 150 bucks down the tube.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.720]   Don't you think that there's going
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.400]   to be Kickstarter fatigue that has inevitably-- many
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.880]   of these projects are not going to produce a product that's
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.800]   worth anything?
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.760]   Who knows if that Pebble Watch that I spent $125 on
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.720]   is going to work, is going to be any good?
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.760]   I think we're in a bubble, a Kickstarter bubble.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.960]   I cannot imagine this is going to continue.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.160]   I'm just waiting for the first really bad case.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   There's going to be a--
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.240]   --a master's getting burned.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.560]   --a horrible example.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.680]   Somebody takes $10 million and goes to Bermuda.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.520]   Well, then's on Kickstarter, right?
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.440]   So they're trying to--
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:36.940]   Are they?
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:37.880]   All right.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.720]   I mean, it's a great model right now.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.520]   These Pebble Guys are very, very happy.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.240]   They asked for $100,000.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.720]   They got $10 million in a month.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.880]   It just closed this week.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.440]   And I ordered a watch.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.120]   But you know, that's a pretty spec--
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.720]   what I don't think people who use Kickstarter
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.640]   realize how speculative what you're doing is,
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.120]   there's no guarantee you're going to get dittily out of that.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.600]   I've been to Wim, which also makes a watch.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.760]   And there was a Y Com and Air company that makes a watch.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.680]   This is a bubble.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.000]   This is not going to continue.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.640]   By buying a share of Facebook, I mean,
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.320]   there's no guarantees anywhere.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.040]   Same amount you probably spent on the watch.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.240]   You know, out of my agreement with you, I think--
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.280]   In a few months, we're going to see Facebook below $20.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.720]   I absolutely believe that.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.040]   But I also believe that if at that point, it got down to, say,
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.520]   $17, and I actually had money to invest,
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.560]   I would invest in Facebook, not for Facebook, but for Zuck.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.520]   Zuck has delivered.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.800]   I mean, you can spin it many different ways.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.440]   But he does have a vision.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.600]   And I see that going elsewhere.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.840]   And I think it actually goes beyond social.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.640]   But you're really doing a disservice, then,
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.080]   because you're not giving Zuck anything.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.200]   You're buying something from somebody else.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.200]   No, and Zuck already got it.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.160]   If 900 million people said, hey, we really like this,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.480]   let's give Zuck $1 a month, what a great business.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.480]   I would be jumping for joy, but why doesn't it work?
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.360]   Why doesn't anyone go that route?
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.760]   That's interesting.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.680]   I mean, I'm not recommending to do that.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.560]   What if Facebook did say, let's start charging on Buck-a-Mont?
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.840]   Could they do that?
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.040]   Probably.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.400]   Some people would stay there.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.000]   I think they could, actually.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.880]   For a Buck-a-Mont, make it cheap.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.840]   Make it $5 a year.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.680]   You find out really quickly which accounts are actually--
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.400]   You would.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.120]   Welcome back to our best of for the year 2012 for Twit.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.720]   And I want to thank the folks at Water Wings Productions,
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.360]   WaterWings Productions.com for our fabulous super eight-bit
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:34.920]   fireplace for today's episode, keeping my butt warm
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.600]   throughout the show.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.280]   Coming up in just a little bit--
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.560]   the chimney-- coming up in just a little bit,
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.160]   we're going to take a look at the launch of the surface,
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.280]   or at least the announcement of the surface,
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.880]   both RT and the surface pro.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.760]   Before we do, though, I'd like to talk a little bit about my
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.440]   friends at Ford.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.600]   You know what Christmas is going to bring me?
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.080]   Well, it didn't bring me yet.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.200]   By next Christmas, I really want the Ford Fusion energy.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.040]   This is the plug-in hybrid which should be coming out in
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.800]   the next month or so.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.960]   You know I'm a big Ford fan.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.840]   And one of the reasons I'm interested in the 2013 Fusion,
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.440]   2013 Tourist 2, is because I can get the blind spot
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.760]   information system bliss with it, including cross-traffic alert.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.760]   This is a really cool technology.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:26.920]   Sensors in the rear panels of the vehicle monitor the blind
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.200]   spot.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.600]   You know, whenever you drive, no matter how good you are
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.920]   with the mirrors, and there's always a part of the car
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:36.520]   behind you and the left and the right of you, you can't see.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.240]   But what's great-- and by the way, one of the number one
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.400]   reasons for auto-axis is lane changing into oncoming traffic.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.240]   So bliss stops that.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.840]   Because what it does is it monitors vehicles on either
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.080]   side.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.240]   And it detects traffic.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.480]   If another vehicle's in your blind spot, you'll get an audio
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.480]   and visual alert warning you, a little bleep in your mirror.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.680]   So you totally know.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.720]   The cross-traffic alert uses the same technologies to warn you
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.640]   as you're pulling out of-- ever how this happened in a
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.680]   parking spot at the mall?
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.280]   You know, there's two big SUVs on either side of your pickup.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.840]   This happens all the time at Petaluma.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.000]   Everybody drives a pickup truck except me.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:16.960]   They're on either side of you.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.480]   And you can't see around them.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.400]   So you're kind of slowly edging out of the parking space.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.160]   The blind spot assist is fantastic.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.640]   Because it can see around corners.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.360]   It sees if there's any oncoming traffic.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.680]   So as you're slowly pulling out, you can observe.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.640]   And you'll know if somebody's coming your way.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.720]   That's a super neat technology.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.000]   They also have active park assist.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.280]   And I've used that, and I can't wait.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.360]   Are you good at parallel parking?
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.360]   Maybe you are.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.640]   Active park assist is better.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.000]   I don't care how good you are.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.720]   You push a button as you're driving by parking spaces.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.760]   And it's measuring the size of the parking space.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.120]   When it sees one, you'll fit into.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.600]   It says, whoa, parking space.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.200]   Pull forward.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.520]   You pull forward.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.760]   It on-- and then when you get to a certain point, you take
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.560]   your foot off the gas.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.400]   Keep your foot on the brake.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.080]   That was my mistake.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.520]   Keep your foot on the brake.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.120]   Because once you park, you're going to have to stop the car.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.400]   And then it's so weird.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.120]   The wheel goes, [SQUEALING]
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.560]   And you do all that perfect geometry pulling
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.160]   into the parking space.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.800]   If you've never used the active park assist on a Ford vehicle,
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.640]   you've got to try it.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.960]   It's amazing.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.200]   Amazing.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.080]   In 24 seconds, you're parked perfectly.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.440]   All you do is operate the accelerator, the gear selector,
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.640]   and the brake pedal.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.960]   I wish they'd told me that before I tried it.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.560]   That's all I'm going to say.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.520]   It is fantastic.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.120]   Ford is putting great technology in their automobiles.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.360]   Technology you can take advantage of if you get one
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.640]   of the new 2013 Ford Fusions or 2013 Ford Tourists.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.160]   These are available technologies in both,
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.480]   or you can go to Ford.com/technology to learn more.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.320]   Thank you, Ford.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.840]   Ford has been such a blessing to us this year,
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.480]   one of our biggest advertisers and a huge support
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.680]   to what we're doing here at Twitch.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.600]   So if it comes around that there's a time you need to buy a car,
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.720]   I hope you'll consider Ford as a way of saying,
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.080]   thank you to them for supporting us.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.240]   Now, ready to move on?
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.080]   All right.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.360]   This next segment is, is Devorak on this one?
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.200]   Who's on this?
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.400]   Well, we'll find out in a second.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.960]   Microsoft announced for the first time ever,
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.880]   this was huge, that they're going to make their own PCs watch.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:28.440]   So is it hyperbole of me to say the biggest week
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.320]   in the history of Microsoft from Microsoft's point of view?
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.360]   Larry, did you go down?
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.880]   No, I was in Washington, DC, but it was a big week.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.320]   I mean, between tablets and phone operating systems,
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.560]   I don't know, the biggest, does it beat Windows 95
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.920]   or Windows 3.0?
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.760]   It's probably not.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.600]   It's pretty big.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.440]   It's pretty big.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.320]   It's a big deal for them because they're betting the company
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.800]   on Metro, they're betting the company
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.000]   on their own hardware or rumor is that they may have their own phone.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.840]   That's a huge departure for Microsoft.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.560]   So maybe it is the biggest week.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.480]   It isn't a new Rime Block, you weren't there either.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.840]   I did not go, no.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.000]   I mean, it was definitely the biggest week I can think of
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.800]   since the Xbox 360 launch.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.600]   You know, I do remember when the main Xbox,
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.560]   the first Xbox launch, that was a pretty big deal.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.720]   That was a big one, but the 360 I think was much bigger.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.840]   360, yeah.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.960]   But I have to say this to me is huge
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.000]   because Microsoft's changing its business model.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.880]   Really good, John Gruber wrote a piece about it
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.880]   on daring fireball referring back to a guy named Did-Do-You
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.800]   and I don't from a Simco blog.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.160]   I don't know, but he wrote, I thought,
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   a very intelligent piece in which he essentially said,
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.720]   "Do the numbers and what Microsoft realized
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.760]   was the writing on the wall.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:47.920]   They'd made all their money selling expensive software
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.040]   on commodity hardware."
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.240]   And really, I mean, we always,
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.160]   Dvorak would always joke,
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.280]   "Well, whose wallet would you rather have?
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.400]   Bill Gates or Steve Jobs?
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.040]   It's better to be in the low overhead software business
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.960]   because it's all profit."
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.920]   But all of a sudden that seems to have changed
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.280]   and Apple has proved that in fact,
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.720]   there's more profit in doing inexpensive software
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.800]   on very expensive hardware.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.440]   And DeGio's premises, Microsoft saw the curves intersecting
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.080]   and said, "We've got to do something about this.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.160]   Does that make sense to you?"
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.360]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.960]   I mean, I don't think that they're looking at it
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.920]   as they're going to make money on the software.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.920]   I think that they're looking at it as owning the whole banana,
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.920]   as we say.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.560]   And a lot of this actually kind of goes back
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:36.480]   before the iPhone as we really started
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.680]   to adopt mobile devices, something changed.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.680]   And that was we had integrated experiences.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:47.000]   And that means, at least in my opinion,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.080]   a software stack and a hardware stack
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.000]   that are very closely tied together
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.880]   and that are not necessarily commoditized.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.960]   And if they don't work well together,
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.240]   the whole thing falls apart.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.600]   And so we started getting used to this,
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.600]   and then Apple raised the game with the iPhone.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.720]   And then all of a sudden, it stopped being about operating
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.920]   system and hardware and pick your hardware,
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.840]   pick your operating system.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.440]   It became single great experiences
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.200]   that people came to expect.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.800]   And I think that that's what Microsoft really realized is,
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.720]   you have to at some point sooner or later
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.960]   to match the great experiences other companies are creating,
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.640]   you have to own the whole banana.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.200]   Horace says that by doing a little division,
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.760]   Microsoft, if you include the office licenses
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.160]   and the Windows licenses, makes about $78
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.440]   of operating profit per PC sold.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.760]   Remember, they don't make the PC, they just make the software.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.200]   He says Apple, if we do a little math,
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.120]   makes $195 per iPad sold.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.080]   And as iPads start to outsell PCs.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:48.240]   - We were talking about Surface.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.680]   - Well, yeah. - It's tablet.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.440]   - Well, they're not having to do Surface
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.520]   because we're only doing the software.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.040]   And then of course Lenovo and Dell and HP
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.880]   are doing the hardware.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.480]   There's not much margin in hardware in the PC.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.920]   - Well, this is a major competitive disadvantage
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.520]   that they had for their hardware partners
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.600]   in the tablet space because I think what I'd read,
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.480]   and I don't have this confirmed yet
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.760]   because I'm not sure if the final OEM pricing is out,
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.440]   but I think I'd read that they were going to charge $75
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.640]   to $85 for Windows RT, which is their version of iOS.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.280]   - So that would be the licensing cost
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.320]   to a tablet management fashion.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.480]   - Right, so if I'm Asus and I want to create
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.760]   a Windows based tablet, I'm gonna have to pay $75
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.920]   just for the OS, which if you look at the breakdown
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.680]   of what goes into one of these things,
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.000]   $75 is enormous.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.200]   That's more, that's at part or maybe even slightly more
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.640]   than the incredible display on the iPad.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.840]   - Ryan, isn't that a game killer
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.480]   for the third party ecosystem?
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.480]   - That's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.240]   It's a huge competitive disadvantage to those guys
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.720]   because they can't compete on price with anyone else
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.360]   if they have to do $75 cost for the OS.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.800]   So for Microsoft's apps, it actually makes a lot of sense.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.000]   - Plus the fact, I don't know how good the hardware
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.960]   is gonna finally be when we see the actual final version of it,
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.440]   but I would guess that Microsoft's gonna do a really good job
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.960]   on the Surface tablet relative to other companies
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.640]   that are gonna create tablets using the same software.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.000]   In fact, I think Google did a superb job
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.080]   on its phones relative to HTC and some of the other players
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.640]   in terms of the branding.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.360]   And so I think that essentially they're gonna kill
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.960]   the entire ecosystem, which I don't get it in that sense.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.800]   I mean, I don't understand.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:30.800]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.640]   I think they're gonna kill,
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.960]   I agree that they're gonna kill the ecosystem
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   on the tablet, on Windows RT.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.160]   But I think that there's still,
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.040]   I mean, look at Dell, Lenovo, HP,
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.520]   they've still gotta sell Windows machines.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.520]   They're gonna sell Windows 8, aren't they?
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.720]   Or are they just gonna be all Windows 7?
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.040]   What about the other-- - No, no, no.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:46.960]   - Robert, you deal with business.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.480]   Business isn't moving to Windows 8.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.800]   - No, it's not, but this is why you've had
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.000]   in this last week, the CEO of Acer came out and essentially--
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.920]   - He laughed, he said they're not gonna make this.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.400]   - Yeah, he said Microsoft was gonna fail.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.280]   And the reason he gave for them failing is
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.120]   they're creating two products.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.240]   They're creating their own product
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.040]   and they're creating the third party market
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.360]   for the service tablet.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.680]   - But you know they only need one to win.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.760]   - They only need one to win.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.480]   And Acer actually bet the farm against tablets.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.960]   At CES this last year,
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.160]   they essentially surrendered the tablet market.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.160]   - Well, that would be another reason
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160]   for Microsoft to do tablets.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.000]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.520]   - Even at Computex, we didn't see a lot
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.960]   of Windows RT tablets, right?
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.200]   I mean, it looked like, okay, I'm gonna make a prediction.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.880]   I got two predictions.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.440]   And I agree with you, by the way,
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.440]   it's not just financial,
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.680]   it's also because integrating hardware and software
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.960]   makes sense, that's Apple's big advantage, right?
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.080]   They give a better user experience.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.360]   I think by doing what they've done,
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.440]   Microsoft's gonna, there's two things that are gonna happen.
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.600]   One, I don't think anybody's gonna make a Windows RT tablet.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.920]   Why, I think that it's all gonna be Windows 8.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.760]   - I don't know about that.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.520]   I think you'll still see people making it.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.280]   The problem is they're gonna be, well, go ahead and make it.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.760]   - And there aren't gonna be many apps,
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.960]   even though there is, in theory,
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.240]   you can push a button when you make a Windows 8 Metro app
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.160]   and it's a Windows RT app.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.320]   I just don't, I think we've seen so many tablets
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:04.240]   like the playbook, like the Zoom, the Android tablets,
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.520]   just die because there weren't enough apps
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.720]   for those tablets, there was no ecosystem.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.480]   So it's 75 bucks, it's an unproven system.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.480]   You can make it, it's just gonna be difficult.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.640]   You can make an Android tablet
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.680]   if you really wanna make a tablet,
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.960]   at least have a shot at it.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.560]   And Microsoft's kind of in the market.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.920]   So how are you gonna compete against Microsoft?
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.120]   So I think this kills Windows RT,
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.520]   except for a Microsoft product,
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.440]   and I think they'll kill it quickly enough
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.120]   because it's not gonna be selling very well
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.560]   with just them making it.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.880]   I think it also means Windows 7
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.200]   gets a end of life in 2025,
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.320]   because I don't think business wants to go to Windows 8.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.160]   I think Microsoft is gonna essentially seed
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.520]   the Windows 7 market to the Lenovo's, the Dell's.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.840]   They're gonna make Windows 8 pro tablets
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.000]   and it's gonna be a very different PC world in there.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.760]   So this is very doom and gloom for you.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:56.800]   I mean, you think that you think it's gonna fail?
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.680]   I think Windows RT will fail up.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.360]   I think Windows 7's got a long life ahead of it
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.360]   because business needs it and wants it.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.720]   I think Windows 8 is gonna take a long time
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.080]   for it to get it to be.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.040]   I think it's Windows RT doesn't work out
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:09.920]   just so we're totally clear.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.800]   That is Microsoft's entire tablet strategy right now.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.640]   Yeah, that's tablet.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.440]   That is not just tablet.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.680]   Wait, what about the one that comes out next year
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.560]   that runs regular Windows 8 and that runs the app?
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.320]   Yeah, so I mean, we--
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.240]   Full blown app.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.240]   I guess it's kind of--
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.080]   That's too fun.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.240]   That's the Windows 8 pro tablet.
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.600]   Yeah, it's kind of pedantic.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.440]   It's an upside down app.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.800]   It's not really a tablet.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.640]   It's not a tablet.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   This is a tablet.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.800]   It is basically a slate PC.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.200]   I mean, it's a full Windows PC.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.320]   So I wouldn't really kind of put it on the Sami.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.880]   It's gonna cost twice as much.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.760]   It's gonna do different things.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.520]   It's not an iPad competitor.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.520]   It's something different.
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.000]   See, I see this as driving something else.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.120]   One of the biggest trends that we're seeing in the enterprise
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.280]   right now is BYOD.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.440]   So you've got all these different vendors
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.880]   trying to figure out how to let the users of a network
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.480]   bring the device that they want to bring.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.880]   And that really what that means is smartphones and tablets.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:03.320]   That happened with the iPhone.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.880]   It's what transformed enterprise phones.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.520]   Exactly.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.000]   And--
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:07.760]   And killed rim.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.800]   And it killed rim.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.800]   But also what you're seeing is that that's
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.160]   been a roading Microsoft's enterprise
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.480]   lead in that space.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.200]   And--
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.680]   Are they worried about the iPad becoming
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.800]   a dominant enterprise platform?
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.520]   I think they are.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.640]   And that's why you've got the Surface RT.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.280]   What they want to do is they want to offer an option
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.160]   for enterprise people to say, if you want a tablet,
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.640]   we can give you one without having to bring your own device.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   We can give you a tablet experience that
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.040]   stays within this network that we've already created,
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.080]   that uses all the same resources that we've already bought.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:42.960]   So I mean, I see that as the real impetus--
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.320]   and why Microsoft released what was clearly
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.840]   an under big product.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.720]   I mean, no one was able to have that flavor there.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.240]   That's the other question.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.200]   What was the hurry here?
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.520]   And it must have been Google I/O, right?
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.160]   Yeah, definitely I/O.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.080]   Why I/O?
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.240]   Well, I mean, we don't know for sure what's going to be announced.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.120]   But we keep hearing about new tablet stuff,
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.240]   and we assume they're going to show a new version of Android.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.640]   So not only is Microsoft terrified of Apple,
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.040]   they're terrified of Google.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:06.720]   Well, as well as well.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.240]   They should be.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.440]   I mean, there isn't a legitimate player in the tablet space
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.400]   other than Apple right now.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.680]   But if there was one, it would be Google.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.640]   They're at least closer than the other guys,
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.160]   which are essentially nonexistent.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.840]   I guess what I'm saying is I can't see Windows RT competing
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.520]   with the iPad.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.120]   I think-- I mean, look, if you zoom way out,
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.200]   we're at your three of tablets, basically.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.640]   And it feels like--
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.400]   Unless you include Microsoft's tablet efforts since 2001.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.960]   Which I don't, because again, those were PCs.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.640]   And they were built as PCs.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.840]   So it's a different paradigm.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.440]   They didn't really know what to do yet.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.040]   Nobody really knew what to do yet.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.200]   They were dabbling.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.800]   We're in your three of tablets.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.920]   I think, like, zoom ahead 10 years, 15 years,
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.000]   when tablets are what most of us are doing,
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   most of our basic computing on and have been for quite some time.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.520]   That could look totally different.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.020]   I noticed you--
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:01.600]   I think it's hard to say, like, way, way down the line.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.720]   You didn't bring a laptop.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.000]   You decided to go tablet on.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:04.520]   Are you doing--
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.520]   I brought a laptop.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.000]   I didn't bring it on.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:06.520]   You didn't bring it on.
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:07.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.160]   OK, so you're on the iPad only.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.600]   You know, I mean, I actually really don't like being iPad only.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.040]   It's not for me.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.200]   If I could only pick one device, it would be my laptop.
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:20.560]   And I feel very weird about going on vacation with only an iPad.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.760]   It just doesn't feel right.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.280]   There's a lot of stuff I know I can't do.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.920]   It's stretch.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.040]   You have to work extra hard.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.680]   You have to bring a keyboard.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.680]   Just bring a laptop for crying out loud, right?
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.720]   Well, I mean, you've got ultra books and MacBook Air.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.280]   I mean, the MacBook Air, ironically, is not that much heavier
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.080]   than the iPad and comes with a full keyboard
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.640]   and all the software you could possibly want.
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.040]   And there's some ultra books out there
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.440]   that are going to fit that bill.
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:49.440]   So I think that for those of us that are doing real work,
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.200]   the laptop is still the machine of choice.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.440]   So here's the question, Robert.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:58.400]   Does business-- Microsoft argument is, well,
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.960]   you're using Windows in business.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.360]   You're using Exchange.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.320]   You want compatibility.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.400]   We're going to give you a Microsoft solution that's
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.520]   going to fit better into your enterprise than the iPad.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.840]   But isn't that what BlackBerry said?
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.720]   You've got BlackBerry Enterprise server.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:18.680]   Isn't that what the Windows Phone 6 and 6.5 was all about?
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.760]   Well, it integrates better.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.840]   It works with Office.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.040]   And that wasn't compelling when we got to the BYOD era.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.160]   People brought iPhones.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.680]   So Microsoft, I think, is counting on the idea that, well,
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.520]   we'll somehow integrate better into the enterprise.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:32.880]   Right.
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.440]   And that's absolutely key.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.920]   And it's something that they have proven they haven't been--
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:37.480]   They haven't.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.400]   Nobody has.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.640]   They had an incredible opportunity with the release
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.800]   of Windows Mobile to tightly integrate it with Exchange,
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.520]   to make it a no brainer to be able to use in the enterprise.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.240]   And it's not there.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.760]   It's actually easier to set up an Android phone on Exchange
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.720]   Server than it is to set up Windows Mobile.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.440]   And that's just-- that's ridiculous.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:54.760]   Well, it doesn't text--
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.520]   Well, it doesn't text Windows Sync with Windows Phone.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.360]   Are you talking about Windows Mobile or Windows Phone?
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:21:59.400]   You talking about Windows Phone?
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.120]   It was phone, now.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.400]   Because Windows Mobile-- that was the key feature of Windows
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:08.360]   Mobile back in the day up to 6.5 was that an amazing--
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.720]   had amazing-- whatever-- exchange integration.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.840]   And that wasn't enough to save it, right?
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.040]   So I think Microsoft probably looked at that and said, OK,
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:20.200]   well, clearly, having a great office-enabled product
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.640]   and enterprise-enabled product is not what's going to save us.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.880]   So we have to work towards the consumer first,
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.440]   and then back our way into that.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.120]   And I actually--
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.720]   So RTS consumer products--
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.640]   So RTS consumer products--
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.680]   Not a business product.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.440]   They didn't really talk about the business story at this launch.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.440]   I mean, they really didn't.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.680]   It was very, very much a consumer-focused launch.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.720]   And I think that's really important.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.840]   We're talking a lot about business.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.280]   But I don't think that this has intended
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.160]   to be a business product.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.240]   I think if we're talking about BYOD,
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.680]   they want this to be a device that consumers feel comfortable with.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.680]   And then becomes BYOD.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.520]   And then becomes BYOD.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.320]   That's how the Apple--
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:50.880]   Right.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.200]   Which is, frankly, it's a strategy they should be taking.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.040]   But I like your analysis of looking at this as year three
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.760]   of tablets, because we could actually take it back.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.840]   Look, five years.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.760]   Five years ago, everything was a net book.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:01.880]   We were moving to the net book.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.640]   And then people realized, well, the net book doesn't really
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.080]   have everything I want.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.720]   Tablets became really popular.
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.840]   People are now using iPads alone,
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.680]   and they realize it doesn't have everything I want.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.440]   And so you've got, on the other side,
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.840]   they're bringing out ultra books.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.560]   And the surface seems to be just an ultra book with a touchscreen.
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:21.400]   So it looks as if Microsoft is betting the farm on a strategy
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:25.640]   that says, people want devices that are going to be like a tablet,
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.160]   but will increasingly allow you to do more of the things you
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.240]   can expect out of a notebook.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.240]   I think it might feel a very nice niche that way.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:36.720]   I think, at least in the higher and heavier version
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.200]   of the surface, Microsoft is also betting
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.240]   that people want to run their Windows software.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.160]   I mean, because there are certainly people who are out there
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.000]   who love their iPad, but are frustrated because there's one
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.240]   or two PC or Mac programs that they simply can't run.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.360]   And I do think that there is a market for that.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.560]   But as pointed out, Microsoft has more than 10 years experience
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.760]   coming out with tablets that are basically just little PCs.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:01.840]   So the question is, by having the hybrid with a metro interface
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.200]   and the desktop, by making it lighter,
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.320]   taking advantage of newer technology,
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.280]   can they finally crack that business market for people
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.400]   who want the tablet that also is a PC?
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.240]   They claim it's a great tablet and a great PC,
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.880]   but that really remains to be seen.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.240]   This rarely works.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.040]   Every time you try to balance multiple disparate needs
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.880]   within the electronics world, it almost never works out.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.880]   I mean, Microsoft has made it work once.
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.000]   And I would say the Xbox 360 is a great example
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.520]   that they created a game console that was also
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.480]   an amazing living room entertainment device.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.680]   But that was something that took them years
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:39.640]   to slowly develop and they're kind of really just now
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.200]   fleshing out that side.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.840]   They got the games down and then they
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.320]   moved to the entertainment stuff over the course of two,
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   three years and software development.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.080]   The one example where it's working,
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.800]   the multifunction device, the printer scanner effect.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.040]   And frankly, when those first came out,
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.480]   there was a lot of question of a pardon my camera here.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.120]   There's a lot of questions about those too
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.120]   because they weren't all that good.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.440]   But that's about the only thing I can think of
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.440]   that really does multiple things well.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.000]   And that's where Apple has succeeded so well,
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.120]   is with this very clear laser-like focus,
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.320]   this is it.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:12.240]   Don't look for a file system.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.600]   Some people said, "Why didn't Apple think
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:18.040]   of putting a keyboard in the smart cover they could have?"
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.640]   And they might still?
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.640]   Or maybe not.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.240]   Maybe that's not, maybe they're freaking--
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.160]   Yeah, I mean, that's kind of my point.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.520]   Whether or not they do or they don't,
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.080]   I think it comes down to, you know,
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.240]   if you hedge too much, everything suffers.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.480]   And at the end of the day,
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.360]   this is really about creating a great user experience.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.720]   It's designed by committee versus vision.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:36.560]   Right.
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.760]   And so I think Microsoft actually did show some vision here.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.240]   And I mean, this could go a couple of ways.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.400]   It could go Xbox or it could go Zoom, right?
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.640]   It could be the Dark Horse Success.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.480]   Jesus.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.560]   Or it could totally belly flop.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.400]   Is it just those two?
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.600]   Is it very binary?
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.600]   Is it kind of a middle word?
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:53.360]   Those are our touchstones for Microsoft hardware products.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.720]   But there's quite a division between the Pro and the RT.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.560]   I mean, the--
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.800]   I think the Pro is DOA.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.600]   And by the way--
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.920]   Pro is DOA, RT--
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:01.440]   Really?
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.040]   Oh, so I was the other way around.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.000]   You think Pro's dead.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.760]   I think Pro not a chance.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.760]   Nobody's going to buy that.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.120]   It's a weird laptop.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.040]   Why would anybody buy that weird laptop for about $1,000
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.320]   when you could go buy a MacBook Air?
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:12.800]   Right.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.160]   I mean--
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.280]   Or somebody explain that to me.
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.160]   It just makes no sense.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.440]   RT, I can see.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.240]   It's going to be really hard for them.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.280]   But I can actually see some people buying that
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.640]   and adopting it.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.760]   The Pro just makes no sense.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.760]   And we've already seen.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.720]   Slate PCs do not sell.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.240]   They're highly verticalized.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.600]   You see them in the medical industry,
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.680]   and that's basically it.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.560]   They don't move.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.080]   Nobody cares about them.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.400]   They're still worst of all worlds.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.960]   But you brought up a very important point.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.080]   That's pricing.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.240]   We still don't have pricing.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:39.760]   Right.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:43.160]   We are all assuming that because Microsoft said, oh, well,
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.440]   it's going to be comparable to Ultrabooks
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.760]   that we're looking at the $800 to $4, right?
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.480]   Let's take a break.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.640]   Because let's talk about what we don't know.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.920]   There's a lot we don't know.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.160]   And there's a lot of missing things.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.200]   I want to talk about the event.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.600]   We're talking about Surface and a very big week for Microsoft.
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.160]   We haven't even gotten to Windows Phone 8,
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.000]   which they also announced this week.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.800]   And we've got the right guy for that with Ryan Block from Gadget,
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.040]   gt.com.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.640]   From on the enterprise side, we've got Father Robert Ballester.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.440]   It's perfect time.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.920]   And you see where Microsoft is in this weird hybrid world,
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:13.400]   right?
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.960]   And then Larry Magad and I also, who
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.200]   have to explain to consumers that there
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.880]   are two kinds of Windows.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.200]   Windows RT and Windows 8 Pro.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.400]   And how do you explain the difference, right?
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.120]   Ah, I don't think you're going to enjoy it.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.760]   It's fun for me, actually.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.720]   I don't usually watch this week in tech,
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.960]   because I was there.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.080]   So I don't watch a show again.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.760]   And it's fun for me to see these.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.320]   Because it reminds me-- what a fun show this is.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.760]   What a great show we do.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.400]   Thanks not so much to me, but to our producer Chad Johnson,
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.200]   who puts this together.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.320]   When did you start this year?
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.360]   When did Eileen?
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.800]   Eileen Rivera did the first half of the year.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.520]   And Chad took over, and both of them,
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.880]   did just such a great job putting these panels together.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.360]   And our great panelists, people like John C. Devorek and Jolio
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.320]   Dell and Alexia Tzotzis and Harry McCracken and Mike Elgin--
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.200]   I could just go on and on.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.640]   We've probably had two or three dozen regular panelists
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.880]   throughout the year.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.920]   And every one of them bring in something fabulous
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:17.280]   to the table-- Ryan Block, Veronica Belmont, Joshua Topolsky,
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.280]   Nillai Patel from The Verge.
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.880]   Just wonderful people.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.360]   Who else?
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.040]   Corey Doctorow joined us this year.
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:30.920]   It was so nice to have Corey's so rarely available for us.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.880]   It's fun for me to go back through time
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.280]   and look at these old episodes.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:38.080]   We're going to get an interesting one in just a second.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.480]   The Matt Honan Hack in a bit.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.560]   But first let me tell you about something that is not a hack.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.000]   That is absolutely fantastic.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.400]   From Landtronics, the XPrint server.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.720]   I got a call today from a guy who was so great.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.080]   He said, I don't have a complaint.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.680]   I don't have a problem.
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.000]   I just want to thank you for something.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.080]   He says, I listen to the shows.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.440]   I love the shows.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.520]   This is on the radio show.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.800]   And I try to buy the products, your sponsors,
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.960]   advertise whenever I can.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.000]   He says, I have a USB printer.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.080]   I wanted to put it on the network.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.640]   And you were talking about this Landtronics XPrint server.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.200]   And I bought one.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.240]   And he said, I just got one complaint.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.760]   He said, I thought there'd be some installations,
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.720]   some configurations, some driver downloads.
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.280]   There was nothing.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.160]   I just plugged it in.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.000]   And it worked.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000]   And this was too easy.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.760]   XPrint server lets you print wirelessly
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.880]   from your iPad, your iPhone, your iPod touch.
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.120]   It turns a USB printer into a network printer.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.680]   If you've got network printers, it makes them work better,
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:36.000]   too.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.640]   No need to print through apps to install software,
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.120]   to email yourself documents for printing.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:44.520]   You print natively right from the iOS menu.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.120]   4,000 printers are supported, all the big brands.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.800]   And it's so easy because it automatically discovers
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.160]   and sets up all your printers, USB and network.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.120]   You just open it, plug it in, and you're printing.
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:59.400]   Just like our caller said, nothing to install.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:04.080]   Now, the Home Edition is normally $99 and supports up
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.040]   to 8 USB and 2 network printers.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.960]   For most people, that's enough.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.240]   We had a school administrator sent us a note saying,
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.640]   I put this in my school network.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:14.000]   And I found every printer in the whole school network,
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.400]   she probably used the Office Edition.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.800]   That's $199.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.760]   And that supports up to 8 USB and unlimited network printers.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:24.320]   So it's a really great IT solution.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.560]   You can find out more at exprinseserver.com/twit.

[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.400]   They up that one, to save 20%.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.680]   And we thank Landronics so much, one
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.680]   of our new advertisers on this week in tech.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.080]   The name Matt Hoehen-- I've known Matt for years.
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.560]   He writes for the Wired Gadget blog.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.480]   I've been a fan of his.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.120]   I think he's kind of been a fan of ours for a long time.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.360]   We've certainly chatted.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.920]   And I was so devastated, so sad.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.000]   When he told the world, he'd been hacked.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.520]   I mean, badly hacked.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:10.960]   They'd got into his Gmail.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.920]   They'd stolen his Twitter account.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.400]   And worse, they got into his iCloud account
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:20.200]   and used a feature of iCloud to delete everything
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:24.880]   on his iPhone, his iPad, and his MacBook Air.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.420]   Matt was devastated, but I give him a lot of credit
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:29.200]   because he told the story.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.280]   He explained what happened.
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:34.440]   He ended up talking to the hacker who did it.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.780]   And we all learned, I think, a really valuable lesson,
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:39.260]   thanks to Matt Hoehen and his willingness
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:44.400]   to share his mistakes, I guess, on the air.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.360]   When that happened, it was the few days after it happened.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.000]   We called Matt, and we got a chance
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.300]   to talk to him on Twitter.
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:52.000]   Here's what it sounded like.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.960]   But before we get into the meat of the matter,
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.320]   I wanted to introduce Matt Hoehen.
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:01.760]   And I've known Matt for quite some time.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.120]   You might remember him from Gizmodo.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.320]   Are you working for Wired now?
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.680]   Or are you just freelancer Matt?
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:08.180]   I am.
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.480]   I'm a full-time at Wired now.
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.160]   For time at Wired.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:16.200]   And I read an article that just terrified me, a blog post
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:19.960]   that you wrote on your blog about getting hacked.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:23.440]   And you can read it at emptyage.com
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.120]   if you want to read the story.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.280]   But I thought we'd get Matt on because I think it's a--
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:29.720]   I don't know.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:36.400]   I think it's a morality tale for the cloud generation.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.360]   What happened?
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.080]   I think that there are several things
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.520]   that are interesting about it.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:45.800]   I think we're all sort of increasingly relying
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.760]   on cloud services.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.240]   And a lot of us, myself at least, tend to link accounts
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:50.800]   together.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:55.520]   And both of those things, when combined,
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.440]   can make for some really dangerous situations.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.680]   So you had an iCloud account.
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:01.800]   Right.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:04.080]   And you turned on a feature of iCloud,
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.680]   which I think is actually a useful feature.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.920]   It's the remote wipe feature.
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.440]   So they've had for a while with the Find My iPhone.
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:11.600]   You could remote-warp a lost iPhone.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.400]   And they now have it.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.840]   And I think this is new in Mountain Line.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.080]   I don't remember it before.
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.960]   The ability to remote wipe a laptop.
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:22.560]   It was certainly a lion feature because I haven't upgraded--
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:22.560]   OK.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:26.680]   --it's a giant lion on my MacBook yet.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.720]   But yeah, and so what happened, if you
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:34.000]   register me to get into it, what happened was Friday,
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.440]   I left work a little early and was home just before 5 o'clock.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:39.480]   And I started playing with my daughter.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.480]   And my phone died.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.680]   Or it looked like it died.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:44.480]   And I went to go plug it in.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:47.040]   And when I plugged it in, it started up to the screen--
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.120]   the start screen, like the initial start screen
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.960]   that you get when you first get a new iPhone.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.520]   This is plugged into iTunes.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.280]   I thought that's weird, but things happen.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:58.320]   And I went downstairs to connect it to my Mac
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.840]   because I backed up really recently to my desktop
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.040]   and restored from that backup.
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:04.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.400]   I should say, when I tried to log into iCloud,
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.600]   it said my password is wrong.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.280]   And again, I didn't think that much of it.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.880]   I went downstairs, flipped up my MacBook.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.280]   And it almost instantly went to a gray screen
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:19.240]   and asked for a pin to log in, a fordage it pin.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.640]   And at that point, I knew I had real problems.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.040]   And what turned out that it happened
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.160]   was that someone hacked into my iCloud account using,
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.440]   basically, social engineering techniques.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:34.160]   And they were able to remove, wipe my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.920]   And because I'm a terrible computer user,
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:39.160]   I hadn't backed up my MacBook in a really long time.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:42.800]   Well, you did something else bad, which was you had--
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:50.600]   iCloud as your password recovery for both Gmail and Twitter.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.200]   I actually just Gmail.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:56.120]   So that was-- yeah, that really exasperated things.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:01.520]   So what happened next was that the apology of pencils
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.080]   basically-- and I've been in touch with the person
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.080]   who hacked into my account.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.920]   They were ultimately trying just to get my Twitter.
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.520]   They just wanted my--
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:11.160]   Because you had the Gizmodo Twitter account.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.480]   They weren't even trying to get to the Gizmodo Twitter account.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:14.760]   This is one mat.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.240]   They just wanted mat.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.560]   The Gizmodo Twitter account was just a bonus.
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.240]   They didn't even realize it was connected until they got into mine.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.000]   At some point, you can link Twitter accounts.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.760]   And so at some point, when I worked at Gizmodo,
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.600]   I had linked my Twitter account with Gizmodo's Twitter account
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.720]   so I could not have to log in and log out every time
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:32.880]   from the web.
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.880]   And that hadn't been undone since I left.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.320]   Even though you had left Twitter, I mean, Niggizmodo, yeah.
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:37.840]   Right.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.120]   So I was still linked.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:41.720]   They didn't actually have password level access
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.240]   to the Gizmodo Twitter account.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.120]   They just had password level access to my Twitter account.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:50.160]   So what they did was they used a social engineering
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:52.040]   technique to get to my iCloud account.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:57.720]   They used my .Mac email as the backup email for Gmail,
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.320]   got into my Gmail, and then used Gmail.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.560]   That's the account verification for Twitter
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.120]   and got into my Twitter account.
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:05.600]   Wow.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.960]   Now, you did a few things wrong.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.320]   And there's going to be pedantic people I know in our chat.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:10.960]   And I remember I said, well, if you had only done this, this,
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.840]   and this, and of course, but this is the kind of thing
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.680]   we're all doing.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.520]   And this is kind of the reason I think it's a morality tale.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.200]   You at first thought your password maybe
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.840]   had been hacked or brute forced.
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:23.240]   Right.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:24.560]   Yeah, that was my initial suspicion.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:29.600]   I mean, I just thought that I had a seven-digit alpha
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.840]   numeric password.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:31.360]   And--
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:32.320]   That's pretty weak.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:32.960]   I've had it for years.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:33.880]   Yeah, and that's pretty weak.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.840]   And I just haven't changed it.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:35.520]   Yours, outlays.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.040]   And I don't use it anywhere else.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:37.840]   But that's not a--
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.240]   That's not a--
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.800]   I use one password.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:43.120]   And most of my passwords now, the new password generator,
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.840]   15 characters, 16 characters.
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:48.680]   And so I thought, OK, well, someone
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:52.400]   used some sort of technique to crack my password.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.600]   A lot of other people were speculating
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.600]   that someone had set up some sort of intercept
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.200]   to a keystroke logger or something.
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:05.000]   But as it turned out, both the hacker told me and Apple
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.920]   subsequently verified Apple textbook,
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:11.120]   verified with me, someone called Apple Tech support
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.000]   at 430 on Friday, around 430 on Friday,
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.280]   claimed to be me, knew some details, knew enough details,
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:25.960]   and was able to have a temporary password issue.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.240]   When the temporary password is issued,
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:30.760]   they are able to log into iCloud and completely change
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:31.240]   the password.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.680]   And that was kind of step one, step two
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.920]   was wiping all my stuff so that I couldn't go in
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.280]   and stop them.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.880]   And step three was going into my Gmail,
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.600]   and going to my Twitter.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.400]   Step four was they deleted my Google account.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:46.960]   And then they just went crazy on my Twitter account
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.960]   for several hours on Friday.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.840]   You say the hacker contacted you.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.960]   How do you know it's him or her?
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:57.800]   I should say I'm not positive that it's him or her,
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.240]   but they've given me details that allow--
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.600]   that they've given me enough details,
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.040]   including some account details, that I
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:06.880]   know that if it wasn't the person who actually did it,
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.320]   that the person was certainly involved in it.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.320]   They know stuff that something else wouldn't
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.200]   be able to tell me.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.520]   And they were targeting your Twitter account.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:15.960]   That was what this whole thing was about
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:18.360]   was so they could put stuff on your Twitter account.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:20.000]   Well, me and the guy said, we just
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.320]   wanted your Twitter account.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.600]   We just did it.
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.640]   He said we didn't have anything personal against you.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.760]   You've got that account back.
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.680]   I do have that account.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.800]   I've got now all my accounts back.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.560]   And Apple has my book.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.800]   I mean, the big priority for me is recovering my data.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.480]   I've got a young child.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.800]   And I just hate thinking of all the pictures
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:45.400]   that I lost all my data.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:45.840]   No kidding.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.040]   Anybody have any questions for Matt?
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.800]   I mean, what do they put up on your Twitter account?
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.000]   Crap.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:55.800]   Was there spam?
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.760]   Why were they trying to make money off?
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:00.200]   What were they-- was it for the lols?
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:04.120]   Links to some YouTube videos, links to some other exports
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:09.920]   they'd done, some screen racist homophobic statements.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.880]   Just--
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:14.800]   So you were just someone with a bunch of followers,
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:20.080]   and they wanted a platform to yell and scream like idiots?
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.120]   I think basically, yeah.
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.560]   And they liked that it was a three-letter Twitter account.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.560]   It's my account.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:29.840]   It's @MAT, which means you join Twitter very, very, very,
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.680]   very early.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.200]   I guess so.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:33.400]   And made yourself a target.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.760]   I've got a question here.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.640]   Yes, I said.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.680]   Matt, do you feel in some sense--
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:43.560]   I know this might be slightly insensitive question to ask--
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.960]   but do you feel lucky in a way that these guys
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.720]   weren't evil and malicious and skillful enough
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.160]   to hide their tracks for days or weeks
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:56.600]   while they mined your information
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:00.440]   and maybe tried to social engineer some of your contacts?
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.960]   Certainly, absolutely.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:02.440]   100%.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:05.920]   I mean, the first thing I did was call--
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.080]   before I even realized that my Gmail had gotten hacked,
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.800]   first thing I did was call Apple.
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:11.700]   And I was on the phone with their tech
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.120]   support department for a very long time.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.920]   And I kept telling them, I got to get off the phone
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.240]   and call my bank.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.360]   Because I mean, I was really worried that they were immediately
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.600]   going to go into my online bank.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.480]   Once you get into somebody's email, you can get everything.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.080]   And I was worried they were going to go into my online banking,
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:28.440]   go into any number of other accounts
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.360]   and just clean me out.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.120]   That was my big concern at the time.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:34.400]   But you also have--
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.440]   I mean, you have, I'm sure, a very impressive address book.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:41.840]   Patrick just changed his Twitter password
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.280]   for the second time of 24 hours.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.400]   I think you're now alone.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.200]   I think there's people listening right now
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.040]   who are all furiously--
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:49.920]   first thing I did when I heard this
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.920]   is I put Turn On Two Factor Authentication on my Google account.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.420]   But go ahead.
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:54.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.920]   I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.420]   Go ahead.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:59.440]   So you must have a pretty impressive address book
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:05.320]   with contacts that if somebody wanted to social engineer
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:10.960]   people you know, people at Apple, people at Google, people
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:15.920]   who are your sources, they could do a fair amount of damage.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.960]   And they could actually use exploits
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.240]   and install keyloggers on those people's machines.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.080]   So in a sense, I mean, as a wake-up call goes,
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.920]   this is a very painful and ugly one.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.640]   But the damage is hopefully contained
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.080]   in a way that it wouldn't have been if somebody had been
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.560]   truly malicious and evil.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.640]   Yeah, it was certainly a wake-up call to me.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.800]   I had to be honest with you.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:43.240]   I hadn't considered using social exploits
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:46.240]   to get to other people from my account.
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.760]   But it was-- it could--
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.880]   I mean, I hate to say it, but I just
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.320]   keep thinking I'm kind of lucky because it really
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:53.400]   could have been a lot worse.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:57.680]   I mean, I'm really distraught about my data possibly
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:58.240]   being lost.
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.120]   But in the grand scheme of things,
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.640]   it was not-- I mean, it could have been so, so, so much worse.
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:03.840]   I'm just puzzled that Apple--
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:07.440]   I don't understand how Apple could have been tricked.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.720]   They-- there's-- I'm not quite ready to--
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.360]   I'm probably going to reveal this in the Wired story
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.360]   tomorrow.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.920]   I've got an email into Apple about this.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:19.800]   And I want Apple-- I want to give them both a chance
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.960]   to respond and to fix this.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.480]   But there's some information that you
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:25.520]   can know about someone's account that
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.680]   lets you bypass having to answer the security question.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.000]   So there's a flaw in their system?
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.400]   I mean, I think so.
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.240]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:34.840]   I mean, it's not information that's easy to get.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:37.000]   I mean, I don't think I could have gotten it.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.200]   I got the impression from the message the hacker sent you
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:43.320]   that he knew of this flaw, that he was exploiting a known flaw.
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:45.840]   Yeah, that's the impression that I have as well.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.400]   I mean, I have the impression that this was--
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.920]   my understanding is that there are multiple people involved
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.240]   in this, and they had multiple areas of expertise.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.160]   The guy who I've been in touch with--
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.400]   and I've only been in touch with one person
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:02.400]   this apparently was his area of expertise.
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:04.960]   Matt, did you get a sense that beyond just being
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:06.840]   a person with a three-letter Twitter account
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.120]   that they knew who you were?
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:11.280]   I got actually the sense that they did not know who I was.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:15.200]   So you were-- it was just-- it could be Ray or Joe.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.200]   Yeah, I thought it was that.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.360]   Which is three letters, that's why they targeted you.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.160]   That's my impression.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:23.560]   I mean, that's what they have said to me.
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.200]   I mean, you know, I don't know.
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.080]   How do you know?
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.480]   And you-- and what are you doing now to protect--
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.960]   obviously, you've got backup from now on.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.720]   Well, I disabled to find my iPhone and to find my iPad.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.480]   I'm looking at my iCloud.
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.440]   You can erase my desktop computer.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.360]   If you can erase my computer at home.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.040]   You can remote wipe any of these computers that are on currently.
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.360]   Just press that remote wipe button.
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.760]   If you got in my iCloud, you could wipe.
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.360]   Don't click that pattern.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.840]   Leo, something that happens when you do that
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:00.560]   is that it initiates a four-digit pin.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.400]   And only the person who presses that button
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:04.240]   gets to see that four-digit pin.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.840]   So if I'm on the other end, if you're on the other end
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.800]   and someone does that, you don't really have any way to stop it.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.160]   And this is one of the things that I think really ought
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.560]   to be fixed about that situation, is
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.940]   that if there's going to be a pin code,
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.000]   ought to be something that you set up,
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.200]   or there ought to be a second password,
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:21.240]   there ought to be something that lets the person basically
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:24.680]   stop this in their tracks, or that at least has some sort
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:28.280]   of secondary level of authentication
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:32.680]   before you can pull a trigger and remotely wipe a hard drive.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.920]   I mean, it's wiping a Mac.
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.400]   I kind of gradually got into this.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.920]   So I first had to find my iPhone set up,
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.120]   and then I was like, oh, well, I could
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.120]   save it for my Mac.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.280]   And that's actually quite different than wiping an iPhone.
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:42.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.920]   I feel like that ought to be-- that ought to have better security.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.520]   That'd be harder to do.
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:49.800]   Matt, I'm sorry this happened to you,
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:52.240]   but in a way, I'm really glad that it happened to you
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.080]   and that the world now knows because of who you are.
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.160]   And I think this is-- and you're-- it's a wake-up.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.440]   I think, as you said it right, it's a wake-up call for everybody.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.000]   And I hope that watching this, everybody
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.880]   is now going to secure their systems as best you can.
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.880]   I mean, would you turn off the iCloud?
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:11.680]   Would you turn off the--
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.400]   I mean, obviously, you've turned off the Find My iPhone
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:15.400]   or wipe my computer.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.160]   Would you suggest everyone do that at this point?
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:22.800]   If you're backing everything up--
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:25.960]   see, this is-- somewhere where I really screwed up, right?
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:29.040]   I mean, so that wasn't backing up.
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.040]   I wasn't backing up my Mac, greater.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:34.880]   And it's-- I back up my desktop Mac every day.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.960]   But I had not backed up my MacBook in a long, long time.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:38.440]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:39.400]   So you were backing up.
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.760]   It's just that one you didn't bet.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:42.320]   And I think a lot of us who have multiple computers
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:44.040]   kind of assume well everything's propagating.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:45.280]   I'm fine.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.240]   Yeah, that was sort of what I--
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.600]   I mean, you know, I just got lazy.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.560]   And I-- so would I recommend that everybody turn off
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:53.880]   Find My iPhone?
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:54.360]   No.
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.360]   But Find My Mac?
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.360]   I mean, I actually probably would turn that off.
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.280]   You know where your Mac is.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.120]   I know where it is.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:02.440]   And it's like, what somebody asked me,
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.800]   like, what's the greater risk?
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.760]   Is it actually having your Mac physically taken
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.480]   from your possession or having someone
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.760]   be able to get into it electronically?
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:14.200]   And I think it's probably the greater risk,
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.880]   the more likely risk for a lot of people with a Mac.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:21.280]   It's not a phone is having it broken into electronically.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.960]   If you can't find your desktop computer,
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.360]   I think you have bigger problems.
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.040]   I understand maybe you thought it got stolen.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:26.480]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.000]   But that's not that likely.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.520]   I also think that we learned a lesson about where
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:33.080]   to send a password recovery emails
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.240]   and to have kind of a rotating set of emails
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:38.760]   not have them all sent to one place.
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:42.720]   The hacker obviously knew that if he did these erasers,
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.640]   you would be very-- it would be very hard for you
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:46.840]   to get everything back.
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.600]   Yeah, obviously.
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.840]   And I gather they sort of backtracked.
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:53.480]   They started with Twitter and down.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:55.560]   OK, well, my Twitter is linked to my Gmail.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:58.320]   And then they-- when they realized that my Gmail was linked
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:03.880]   to Doc Mac as the backup there, is the verification there,
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:07.120]   it was sort of like a jackpot moment for them.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.920]   And having that all linked together was also a bad idea.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.120]   And it's also something I've changed.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:16.480]   I've set up two-factor authentication on my Gmail.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.480]   That's a pain, by the way.
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:19.160]   I did it too, as soon as I read your story.
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:20.520]   And that's a pain.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.000]   I used to have to do it for work-related emails.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.760]   And I always thought it was a pain.
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:25.480]   But you know what?
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.680]   I'm doing it now.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.720]   You have to run Google Authenticator on your phone.
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.120]   You can authenticate Google's stuff pretty easily.
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:33.760]   You just add that second factor.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:36.400]   But then apps that don't know about two-factor authentication,
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.760]   you have to get a special password generated from Google
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.600]   and enter both passwords.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:41.760]   Well, it's a trade-off.
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:43.520]   Security at best is imperfect.
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.560]   There is no patch for human stupidity.
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.920]   Large, multi-billion-- no, no, no, no, no.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.720]   And that's not for you, Matt.
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:51.200]   Think about that.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.960]   Apple's got more money than just about any corporation
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:54.920]   in North America.
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:57.520]   And they allowed somebody to social engineer their way
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:00.240]   and do locking at you out of your digital life.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:03.120]   That's bad.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:06.200]   Whether that was a failure between the keyboard
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:09.280]   and the chair by whoever was answering the phone
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.280]   or whether that was a massive flaw in the way
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.960]   they institute the system, which I think we'll probably
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:16.080]   find more out in your Wired article tomorrow.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.920]   But I can't wait.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:22.400]   That scares the delete expletive out of me.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.240]   That sucks, dude.
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:25.320]   And I'm sorry you went through this.
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:26.320]   I've for a long time--
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:28.600]   I used to write a few pieces about this for Newsmodo.
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:31.400]   But I really feel like password systems in general.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:32.840]   I mean, passwords are just a broken system.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.920]   I mean, just using passwords or a terrible system.
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:38.000]   I know there are a lot of smart people working on other options.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:38.920]   We don't have them yet.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.760]   And the ultimate failure point here
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.240]   was this temporary password that was issued.
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:45.960]   I mean, this has reinforced every bad feeling
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.600]   I have about our password-based authentication systems.
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.640]   What would you suggest?
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.040]   I mean, eyeballs or what?
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:53.040]   I'm curious.
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.240]   What are the solutions?
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:54.760]   I don't know.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.160]   I mean, I think there might be some browser-based solutions
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.200]   for web logins.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.280]   But generally speaking, I don't know.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:02.840]   And I've talked to people in the US government
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.680]   about that even.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:07.760]   I know that the president has actually
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:09.680]   set up a special office where they're looking at it,
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:11.400]   sort of working on next generation password things.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.440]   But one of the big problems is that Microsoft
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.600]   is working on one thing and Google is working on another
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:18.360]   and Apple is working on another and Facebook's
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:19.000]   working on another.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.920]   And everybody sort of has a vested interest
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.200]   in being identity providers.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:30.360]   And that means that you don't get some sort of top-down
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.360]   standard.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.240]   It's really important too as we start doing virtual money
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:35.000]   and things like that.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.640]   Because really all of financial transaction is about
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.480]   is authenticating the two parties.
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:44.440]   And if you don't have good authentication systems,
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.200]   we aren't moving full speed ahead
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.880]   towards digital financial transfers.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:53.160]   And all due respect to any PayPal employees in the audience,
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:57.000]   we all know that with large multinational banks make a mistake,
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:57.920]   it's your fault.
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:58.440]   Right.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:49:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:00.720]   We're going to lock you out of your account forever.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:02.440]   I want to say good fact you're authenticating.
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:03.880]   I think that's a good start.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.720]   And I think sending a four-digit passcode to a cell phone
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:11.560]   one-time use or having something like Google Authenticator
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.480]   or the Blizzard Authenticator give you these rotating numbers.
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.680]   I think that's a pretty good start.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:18.560]   I'm going all cash.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:20.920]   You'd have to steal my phone and steal my password.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.800]   I'm going straight barter from here on out.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:23.840]   You're going to let you go.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:24.360]   Thank you.
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.520]   That, Matt, honed, I'm sorry that happened to you.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:29.880]   Yeah, if you're going all cash, I'll be at your house.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.240]   Yeah, which is safer, right?
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.720]   Your mattress or yourself.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:33.840]   Nothing is safe.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:34.800]   Nothing is safe.
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:35.480]   There you go.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.280]   Acceptable risk.
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:38.160]   Best to own nothing.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.040]   Thank you, Matt Honan.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:40.040]   Thanks, Matt.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:40.520]   Take care.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:47.920]   Maybe you go home on Wednesday, right?
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:49.960]   Instead of waiting till Thursday, that kind of--
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.680]   And you could probably chime in.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:53.240]   Yeah, that I've had many of yours.
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:54.240]   There you go.
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:56.040]   Ho, ho, ho.
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:56.600]   Ho, ho.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.520]   Speaking of the many, it's here.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.640]   Came on Friday.
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:01.240]   Apparently, he sold out already.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.360]   Sold out already, yes.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.600]   But that's what we don't want in Stockton.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:05.720]   Do you know where it's Stockton?
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:06.480]   Not from here.
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:06.880]   Let's go.
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:07.880]   Road trip.
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:11.200]   I had an Omala cat to go and send--
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.640]   had to go and get one in Stockton.
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:14.040]   He was having such a hard time.
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:15.360]   He wanted one that bad.
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.760]   Well, I think I'm going to wait.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:17.920]   And I was like, you're not going to wait.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:18.720]   Just get it.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:19.760]   And he's like, OK, I'm going to get it.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:22.720]   With all you need to know is the Wi-Fi, black or white.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.440]   Or you can spray paint it.
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:25.200]   You got the black--
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:27.880]   With a 3G, but that comes at the end of the month.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.320]   So I have the black one here.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:29.960]   With the white cover.
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:30.760]   Just a white cover.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.040]   So I have to say, I've never believed
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:35.400]   that the iPad was a mobile device.
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.400]   It's too heavy in mid.
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:36.800]   Too heavy.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:37.840]   It's too big.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.400]   It's like it's a second laptop.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:40.240]   It just doesn't have a keyboard.
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:42.680]   Because you're a welterweight.
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:44.160]   Because he has a MacBook Air 11.
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:45.600]   It's bar fighting.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.440]   As do we all.
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:49.040]   But this is like the first--
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:49.600]   No, look.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.800]   These three have the same three.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:54.040]   Oh, I thought you were talking about something else.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.440]   I was talking about the thing I just said.
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:57.800]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:51:59.360]   It's OK.
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:00.600]   Get to spend my whole drink.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:01.680]   I got my whole drink.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:04.240]   So--
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:06.440]   I'm not just hanging out with you would help.
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.000]   But I guess not.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:08.880]   Continue, Joe.
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:11.840]   I'm going to continue on the 7.9 inch--
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:15.400]   7.9 inch, 7.9 inch device.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.560]   Much more realistically.
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.480]   Yeah, much more realistically.
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:20.960]   Or for you, there's the iPhone.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:21.960]   Five inches now.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:22.960]   It's smart.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:23.480]   Four?
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:23.840]   There's that.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:24.240]   Really?
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:24.840]   Yeah, it was 3.9 inch.
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.600]   I always liked that optical inch.
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:27.680]   Extra optical inch.
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:28.760]   But anyway, that's another matter.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:29.600]   Depends on the weather.
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.880]   So I actually-- I really like this thing.
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.680]   I mean, sure, it doesn't have the retina display.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.240]   And I feel like that was kind of a cheap shot
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:37.040]   because they could easily put it in.
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.200]   Because they clearly put it in the phone.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:39.240]   Why would you de-retinize?
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:40.200]   The phone handy.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.600]   I had the touch.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:43.920]   But what do you think of yours?
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:45.600]   They wanted a Capita on price, right?
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:45.960]   With the--
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:47.280]   Yeah, but that's a mistake.
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:47.840]   That's a mistake.
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:48.800]   I think it's a mistake.
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.760]   Apple never wants a Capita on price, do they?
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:51.040]   Really?
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:51.560]   It's interesting.
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:54.360]   Nick and I both independently came to the same conclusion,
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.720]   which was that Apple has def--
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:56.920]   So you wrote an article about this.
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:58.080]   Which planned up the lessons.
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:01.000]   They deferred an 8 megapixel camera
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.520]   and a retina display in this thing.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.800]   They could have easily included it because they want to do it.
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:05.600]   They want something for next year.
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:06.760]   They're going to do it six months from now.
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:07.760]   Exactly.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:10.200]   And so what it is, it's planned up the lessons.
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:13.120]   So planned up the lessons was developed in the 1940s
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:14.200]   or '50s with cars.
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.240]   IBM used to do it.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:18.040]   They would hold back innovation, stagger step them out,
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:20.440]   in the '50s with mainframe computers,
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:22.640]   because they wanted to sell new models, cars, same thing,
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:23.140]   cars.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:24.200]   The catalogs, it was the fins.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.200]   So they did larger fins and smaller fins.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.880]   So what's the timing on when this gets a real display?
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.120]   I think it's going to be September 2017.
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:32.400]   It'll be in the fall from the whole year.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:35.920]   But here's a sell 10 million or whatever it is.
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:37.920]   My general take was Apple should not have--
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:38.760]   I think you're right, Brian.
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:40.520]   I think that they were somewhat aware of the low end.
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:41.960]   But look what happened.
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:43.960]   Google came out and said, OK, we'll take 50 bucks
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:45.160]   up to Nexus 7.
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.760]   The problem is you cannot compete at the low end,
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:49.160]   because neither Google nor Amazon has the same business
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:49.960]   model as Apple.
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:50.400]   Correct.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:52.080]   Google makes money when you use it.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.600]   Amazon makes money when you use it.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:54.960]   Apple makes money when you buy it.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:58.920]   So when I covered the release of the Kindle HD,
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:00.360]   and I spoke to Bezos--
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:00.920]   That's what he said.
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:03.120]   --and he said, I don't care if you have the first Kindle
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.520]   in your drawer or this Kindle.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:06.680]   He's like, we just care if you buy books.
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:07.880]   If you buy media from us.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:10.880]   Whereas for Apple, if they care if you have the newest device--
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:11.560]   It's the hardware.
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.760]   It's the marginal hardware.
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:15.360]   They probably make some money on the ecosystem after the fact.
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.480]   But mostly, it's not the question.
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:17.000]   Not the question.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.160]   For the crew, what's more important in the long run?
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:23.320]   Because I'm kind of fed up buying new Apple devices.
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.320]   I'm not running out.
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:25.240]   I think what's starting to happen
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.440]   is there's going to be some fatigue.
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.960]   I think the five is the beginning of that.
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:28.960]   This maybe as well.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.240]   So in the long run, is Amazon have a better business model?
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:36.120]   Because they're based on the media, not the device?
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:38.360]   In my opinion, Amazon Kindle Fire HD,
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:40.600]   which I've used extensively, is not very good.
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:41.200]   I agree.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:41.840]   It's a bad UI.
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.280]   It's a bad UI.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:43.840]   The next is--
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:44.120]   This is the--
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:46.160]   --7 on the other hand is extremely competitive.
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:48.600]   It's $200 for 16 gigabytes.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:49.800]   It's got a higher res screen.
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.920]   The only thing lacking, it doesn't have a rear-facing camera.
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.320]   I think most people don't care about that.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:57.040]   And so my recommendation was not to buy the mini.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.560]   If price is an issue, get the--
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:01.920]   The Nexus 7 is a wonderful, wonderful device.
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:03.320]   And I think Apple should have.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:05.960]   And I think you and I, both before the show, agree to this.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:08.200]   Not have said we're going to make a competitive low price
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:08.520]   product.
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:10.400]   We're going to make a small iPad.
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.920]   And we're going to charge whatever
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:13.400]   we need to charge to make it a retinist.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:14.520]   Maybe like an iPad mini.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:15.880]   Like an iPad mini.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:16.440]   Like an iPad mini.
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:17.720]   Mega mini.
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:20.440]   Now, do you think that they would have been better off
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:22.960]   if they had offered--
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.680]   because the press event was obviously--
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:26.440]   it was a heavy focus on the iPad mini,
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:29.600]   and then a minor focus on the latest provision of the iPad.
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:32.200]   I almost feel like the fact that they tried to pull this--
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.040]   as they were very good at, in general,
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:36.200]   this breathless new innovation, something
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:38.400]   you've always wanted for essentially what's
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.600]   a mushy middle product.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:41.640]   It's something that pretty much just bridges the gap
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:43.440]   between your cell phone and an iPad.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.840]   I think they would have been better off
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:47.840]   if they played it down as an afterthought.
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:51.080]   They focus more on the new iPad revisions,
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:54.840]   and then say, oh, BTW's people seem to like smaller devices.
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:57.000]   So we made one of those for you too, if you're interested.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.760]   Then they could have charged $100 more,
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:00.120]   and nobody would have complained.
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:01.200]   That's not Apple's way, though.
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:03.840]   Somebody has said on the thread, they feel bad for Apple.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:06.080]   It's $650 billion.
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.720]   They have $121 billion in cash in the bank.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:09.720]   So both of these are misplaced.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.080]   They could buy Greece.
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.840]   What's to feel bad for?
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.280]   That's the answer to your question.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:17.080]   You were asking whether or not Amazon had the better business
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:18.160]   model, clearly not.
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:19.640]   Otherwise, they would be an Apple's way.
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:20.840]   Yeah, but I remember for years--
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:22.240]   But you said the long run as well.
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:22.840]   Well, long run.
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.320]   Because I remember for years we said, who is--
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:26.600]   Walla, would you rather have Steve Jobs or Bill Gates?
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:30.120]   Bill Gates had a model where Microsoft paid very little
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:31.360]   for-- software is free.
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:34.120]   They don't have to-- and they judged a lot of money.
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.200]   But as time went by, Apple's business model
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:38.000]   actually turned out to be the better business model.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.480]   And I think part of the choice is, are there limited?
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:44.160]   Is there a declining margin of return
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:46.360]   on the awesomeness of the hardware
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.360]   beyond which you're just not impressed anymore?
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:49.240]   Well, that's what's happening.
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:51.240]   And then who has so on?
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.720]   What is the thing, the thread between all these devices,
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.360]   their rectangles?
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:55.920]   And what's going to happen is they're just
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:57.280]   going to get thinner and thinner and thinner.
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:57.920]   And that's it.
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:00.680]   So when do we stop caring about the specs?
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:02.880]   And then on the second term, we already do.
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:03.400]   OK.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:04.360]   It's a service issue.
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.800]   Who's got the better ecosystem?
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:06.560]   Am I locked in?
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:07.680]   But that's what it comes down to.
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:08.800]   It's the two iTunes.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:10.480]   To my account, to the wallet they have,
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:13.840]   to the investment I've already made in my TV subscriptions
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:17.120]   there, or am I tied into Amazon because of my book
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:19.080]   relationship with them and my shipping relationship,
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:21.840]   my Amazon Prime, or is it to Google with their burgeoning--
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.560]   OK, so that's really interesting because I am tied
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:28.200]   into Amazon with my books because it works on any device.
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:28.760]   Same.
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:31.640]   Apple, I don't buy books from because it works on Apple devices.
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:34.240]   But I do buy most of my TV through Apple.
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:34.880]   Yes.
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:36.640]   But that's because it's a one-time thing, right?
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:37.960]   It's an I watch it once.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:39.680]   You don't save your TV shows much later.
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.120]   No, it's true.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:41.280]   But it'll be a books or Kindle.
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.920]   Things that you want for an extended period of time,
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.600]   you're going to go with the brand that allows you to do that.
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:48.880]   Things that you want immediately, you'll go with that.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:50.600]   The music I go with neither.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:52.520]   I do predict all the services that we're
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:55.000]   going to hear record sales numbers for the iPad many hours.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.040]   Of course.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:56.560]   Absolutely.
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:57.480]   So what are we saying?
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:59.360]   We're not saying that it's not going to be a success.
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.800]   What we're saying is what I believe
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:04.560]   is I bought this cable here, right?
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:05.760]   And that's driving me crazy.
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.720]   A fire--
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:08.000]   Lightning.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.640]   Lightning cable to USB, $29.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:12.040]   Fing dollars, OK?
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:13.520]   Seriously, screw you guys.
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:15.600]   Because this thing costs $0.50 to make.
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:16.200]   Because you know what?
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.000]   Every single one of these cables that comes out,
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.400]   there's a third party that makes them.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:20.400]   And they cost $0.50.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.720]   These have authentication chips.
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:23.120]   And so they are more expensive.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.080]   OK, $0.56.
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:25.600]   OK.
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:26.080]   Right?
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:27.080]   That's a huge difference.
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:28.480]   I got more than 10% difference.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:29.960]   But as a customer--
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:31.360]   But as a customer--
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:32.160]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:33.360]   As a customer, it's annoying.
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:35.360]   It's like completely frustrating and disrespectful.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:38.040]   Because Apple did have to move everybody from that 30-pin
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:40.600]   connector, they should have really charged cost for these,
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:42.760]   at least to make up for the fact that you're going to have
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:43.200]   some pain.
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:44.440]   You're going to have to buy a buy-up.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:44.440]   Exactly.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.600]   And I've spent $200 on Lightning cables.
[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:47.280]   I have two.
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:48.280]   And it's really frustrating.
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:49.280]   And it's really frustrating.
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:51.560]   And I think it's not fair to the customer.
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:52.760]   I really truly believe it's not.
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.920]   But it's not hurting Apple's bottom line at all.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:55.480]   And will that--
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:55.480]   And will that--
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:56.840]   And fair enough to the point too?
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:57.720]   And will that's the advantage?
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:00.960]   Fairness of the customer is ultimately measured in sales.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:02.200]   Well, I mean, he has to know--
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:03.600]   I mean, there's a long term in the short term.
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:06.240]   Of course, they're making money handover fist.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.720]   But they're eroding their long term brand value.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.800]   This is the cash mean.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:10.680]   This is what you see.
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:11.280]   This is--
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:13.640]   Yeah, but I got to say, they've been doing this historically.
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:16.280]   Remember how much Apple charged for RAM?
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:17.240]   They stopped doing that.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.400]   But they used to charge five times what RAM cost when you
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:21.800]   bought a Mac with more RAM.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:22.800]   What's your--
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:23.560]   And it didn't hurt him?
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.280]   Did it, Brian?
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:27.360]   Well, I mean, again, it's tough to say right now.
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.440]   I mean, it's in a post jobs era.
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.760]   It's very difficult to know whether or not any of these things
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:34.800]   are chipping away, to what extent.
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:39.600]   But in many ways, brands tend to get to the top of their game,
[01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:41.800]   and then they begin to cannibalize themselves
[01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:44.920]   because they can't resist taking advantage of all the power
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:47.760]   they have, not realizing that for all the money they get,
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:49.040]   they are chipping away at their value.
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:49.680]   Absolutely.
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:51.080]   And you saw that--
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:53.360]   you see what the cables you saw with maps,
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:56.560]   which was a forced downgrade to many of its users.
[01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:59.120]   Would you have been led to expect a certain service level,
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:02.400]   and then they violated that trust and that expectation?
[02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:04.640]   Yeah, in fact, I talked to somebody on an iPhone 4
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:06.160]   on the radio show today.
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:09.120]   And she, as you would normally do, installed iOS 6
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:11.160]   because Apple said, you should install the new update.
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:12.160]   Why would you not--
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:14.040]   And all of a sudden, it took away features.
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.000]   Yeah, you upgrades don't decline.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:16.600]   She was very upset.
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:18.000]   It couldn't reduce the value.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:18.480]   Yeah.
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:20.280]   And I don't know if we actually put this in our story,
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:21.840]   but I'm going to break some news here.
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:22.360]   Exclusive.
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:24.240]   So exclusive on Twitch.
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:27.520]   So apparently, Johnny is a big fan of--
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:30.240]   I mean, he thinks that the Windows Phone 8 design is actually
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:31.320]   quite nice, right?
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:32.360]   And I think it is.
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.160]   It is what we call digital native.
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:34.360]   Yeah.
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:37.680]   No longer refers back to the free, non-digital--
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:41.040]   And Scott apparently thought it was crap.
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:43.920]   And so there was that.
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:45.760]   And then there was a lot of the stuff that happened
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:46.600]   with Apple Maps.
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:49.440]   And apparently, there was a big meeting with the execs,
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:50.960]   and they wanted to put it out in apology.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:54.280]   And Tim Cook asked Scott to sign it, and Scott refused,
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.880]   which is what we reported.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:59.240]   And Scott also just didn't play well with others.
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:01.400]   Now, Olmalek said, I couldn't get any of my sources
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:04.720]   to confirm that this was the issue, but--
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:05.640]   Which part?
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:06.760]   Part about signing the letter.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:08.480]   I think that was one of them, but there's
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.400]   been a lot of tension.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:09.920]   It makes sense.
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:10.960]   So you're the CEO.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:12.720]   You want this apology.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.760]   You're going to do this apology.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:15.840]   And when you're forced to sign it yourself,
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:18.120]   because the guy responsible for iOS said,
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:19.360]   and I am not signing it.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:20.200]   I am not.
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:21.000]   Here's an example.
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.760]   This is this photo booth in Snow Leopard, which
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.520]   is fairly clean and simple.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:27.560]   Here's photo booth in Lyon.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:29.400]   Oh, it's got red velvet curtains.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:29.900]   Exactly.
[02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:31.080]   That always irritates me.
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:31.800]   And games and--
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:32.600]   So what is--
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:33.760]   Game Center's got this awful.
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:35.360]   Green Bayes.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:37.000]   It makes me not want to have fun.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:37.840]   Game Center looks like--
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.560]   --a thing that is a bit.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:39.480]   --that's fun.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:40.560]   It's totally fun.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:42.880]   So in Scott's defense, Scott--
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:46.700]   Single-handedly was one of the people that put iOS where
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:47.200]   it is today.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.920]   There are hundreds of millions of people on iOS.
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:50.240]   I mean, hundreds of these devices.
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.960]   People point to Siri and Maps as a debacle,
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:55.280]   but everything else has been hugely successful.
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:55.780]   Exactly.
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:59.840]   And I think that when Steve was running the company,
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:02.520]   you can ask Walt Rizix and Adam Lushinsky,
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:04.120]   all these guys that have written books on this.
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:06.560]   When Steve was running the company, he enjoyed and he liked
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:09.080]   and he promoted the tension within the company.
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:09.680]   He wanted that.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.360]   He wanted that because he created a force.
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:12.400]   He created a creative force.
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:13.080]   And I think it worked.
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:14.680]   Like when you have people that are like,
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:15.840]   "Screamorphic is amazing."
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:16.840]   And people are like, "It sucks."
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:19.600]   It works when you have a dictator who can say,
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:20.520]   "You're right.
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:21.960]   We're going to do it this way."
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.920]   But if there's nobody with that strong leading,
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:24.720]   and it's very--
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:29.000]   And so when Steve left, there was a giant power vacuum
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:29.520]   at Apple.
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:32.080]   And which I stepped.
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:33.200]   I love to see you.
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.160]   It's me, everybody.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:36.320]   I'm actually the guy behind me.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:39.960]   One of the stories was that Scott was very preening
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:41.800]   and grooming himself to be the next CEO.
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:42.760]   Yes.
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:45.160]   Nobody else thought this, but he thought he should be the next--
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:48.800]   And I've heard this from several sources, very senior people
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:49.560]   too.
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:52.920]   And other people have reported it.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:55.560]   He believed that he should have been CEO, not Tim.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:56.040]   And--
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:57.520]   So there's a problem right there.
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:58.840]   And I think there's a problem right there.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:02:59.400]   And I think that--
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:00.400]   And the thing with Scott--
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:01.280]   It's like Emma.
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:02.680]   The thing with Scott was--
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.280]   I mean--
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:04.360]   We should have a game of Apple.
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.440]   You become CEO or you die.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.440]   Exactly.
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.840]   That's really true.
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.360]   That's good.
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.480]   I love Schwood.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:13.240]   But what-- I interviewed Walter Isaacson
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:14.640]   to do a Q&A with him after the book came out.
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:16.200]   And one of the things that he said that really stuck out
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:19.840]   with me was Steve Jobs was there was half of him
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.120]   that was this creative genius.
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:23.400]   And there was half of him that was this technical genius,
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:24.360]   if you will.
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:25.640]   And there was also problems.
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:27.240]   He's not the greatest guy ever.
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:29.080]   But that was the gist of it.
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:32.040]   And when you take Tim Cook and Johnny Ive
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:34.160]   and you put those two together, they are that.
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:36.680]   So Johnny is the creative genius.
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:38.320]   Tim is the business genius.
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:40.480]   And they together make what essentially Apple
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:41.680]   was with Steve Jobs right there.
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.200]   And that's what you have now.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:45.920]   Because Johnny Ive-- this is the first time at Apple.
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:47.920]   I can remember somebody being in charge of everything.
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:48.440]   Everything.
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.080]   He's in charge of human interface design
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:51.080]   across all problems.
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:51.840]   Which makes sense.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:52.840]   Oh yeah, I think so too.
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:55.640]   And I think that you'll start to see a much more beautiful
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:58.600]   and consistent user interface that spans every single part
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:03:59.760]   of the OS.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:00.800]   So you know more animals.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:02.760]   And he knew who was the iTunes guy is now responsible
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:04.680]   for software across the board.
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:08.080]   Now, do you think Scott needed to go?
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:09.920]   I mean, what is your sense of-- there were reports--
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:11.680]   I think it was in your story, in fact,
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:13.600]   that people were celebrating.
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:16.080]   They were going to the bars and saying, ding dong the witches
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:17.280]   dead when he was fired.
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:19.680]   Yeah, there was somebody that said it's better than the Giants
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:22.480]   winning that was a source.
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:23.280]   Wow, that's a lot.
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.280]   That's a saying a lot.
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:25.680]   You know, coming from someone in California.
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:26.880]   There's one thing that really surprised me
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:28.560]   in the media coverage of this is people
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:31.400]   who were saying maps was a miss.
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.960]   But then they listed Siri as a black eye.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:35.320]   And I've never thought of Siri.
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:38.080]   I'm somebody who's on the road, always behind the wheel,
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:40.000]   or riding my bike.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.640]   I use Siri nonstop.
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.440]   And I find it, in general, really good.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:46.680]   And I was surprised that we didn't hear more Siri talk
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:47.800]   at the last--
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:49.400]   I'll tell you why Siri's a failure.
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:54.280]   First of all, they bought a program, Siri, that did more
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:56.280]   than Siri does even today.
[02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:57.760]   It never got out of beta.
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:59.680]   The network has been highly unreliable.
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:01.160]   So I don't know about you, Brian.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:04.000]   But don't you find that at least some large percent
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.720]   of the time you try to communicate with Siri,
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:07.680]   she comes back saying, I'm sorry, I can't help you right now.
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:10.080]   And it's not just a 3G thing, it's Wi-Fi too.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:11.080]   Right.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:11.600]   Yeah, well, it's--
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.920]   It's a Siri's network, not us.
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:13.160]   Yeah.
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:15.640]   When it happens, it almost exclusively
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:17.720]   is because of connectivity issues, not because you--
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:18.240]   No, it's not.
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:19.200]   --is what I'm saying.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.000]   No, it's not.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.840]   And I think that that's a common misconception
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.480]   that you're having connectivity issues.
[02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:24.840]   It's North Carolina.
[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:27.520]   It's their data center is not responsive.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:29.120]   And I know that because it happens here
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:30.440]   when we have very good connectivity.
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:33.800]   You don't think it's a matter of the consumer product not
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:34.520]   being appreciated.
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:37.000]   You think it's a case where the infrastructure is not strong
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.600]   enough, and that's why they're not continuing to build on it?
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:42.000]   I believe that's part of the problem.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:42.520]   I don't know.
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:45.320]   Maybe Nick knows better what the thinking is inside Apple.
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:47.160]   But Siri should be out of beta by now.
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:48.760]   Siri should be better than it is by now.
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:49.600]   It's just now.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:52.080]   Siri should be able to download personality.
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:54.200]   You should be able to download different personalities.
[02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:54.600]   No, this is true.
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:56.680]   I want mine to be the night writer car.
[02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:57.040]   I want to--
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:05:57.600]   I want to--
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:58.840]   You want to kid my Siri.
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:05:59.640]   I would pay for that a lot.
[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:00.920]   If you look at--
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:04.720]   look, go back to All Things D when they demoed Siri
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:07.040]   before it was purchased as Siri, before it's purchased
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:07.440]   by Apple.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:10.200]   And there was these great things where you could say,
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:13.000]   what are the five biggest lakes in California?
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.120]   Watch the temperature in South Dakota
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:17.000]   compared to the temperature in North Carolina.
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.040]   You can't hear so very--
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:19.800]   And they stripped all these things out.
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:22.560]   And I think that if they're going to do it in beta,
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:23.360]   do it in beta.
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:26.720]   Throw everything in there and let us have fun and play with it.
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:30.240]   Or strip it out and say it's not in beta or whatever it is
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:30.840]   that you need to know.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:33.360]   I guess, Brian, that you're good experience with Siri
[02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:35.400]   is because you have limited severely
[02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:37.080]   what you try to do with it.
[02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:37.440]   Yeah.
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.240]   I mean, you know what Siri's going to do well
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:40.680]   and what she's not going to do well.
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:41.000]   Right.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:41.320]   Right.
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:42.400]   And I guess part of that--
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:43.480]   it's very compartmentalized.
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:45.320]   You could do the parlor trick of asking,
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:46.480]   what's the mass of Jupiter?
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:50.120]   And it calls up the stuff from Wolfram Alpha.
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:52.760]   But for sending texts, I very rarely have
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:54.240]   or dictate texts to me.
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:57.200]   But when I'm out on my bike, I mean, there's nothing I--
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:00.160]   I got hands on the handles.
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:01.480]   I'm not able to do anything.
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:03.360]   And it's a big pain in the butt to pull out the phone.
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.960]   So I use it a lot for that.
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:06.600]   And there are times I send out texts.
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:07.720]   I'm like, yeah, that's close enough.
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:08.080]   Sure.
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:08.600]   Whatever.
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:10.120]   I have to do that all the time.
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:11.680]   And sometimes it's a wonderful art about--
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:13.720]   Sending tests by accident.
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:14.680]   But that's different.
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:15.200]   That's nuance.
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:16.440]   That's the nuanced dictation.
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:18.520]   That's actually something different.
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:19.920]   And it's not something Apple developed.
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:21.520]   My failure has been--
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:23.600]   like there's a certain level of--
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:25.920]   there's a certain service level that I expect.
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:28.640]   And when it fails, then my trust in the system is degraded.
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:31.160]   So it just becomes binary for me.
[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:34.760]   If it doesn't work 98 plus percent of the time,
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:36.240]   it works 0% of the time.
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:36.600]   Exactly.
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:39.720]   And so what I will dictate a query or a transcription,
[02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:40.960]   and it pings the server and gives me
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:44.600]   a little beautiful purple dots, and then comes back with 0.
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:46.280]   And I've just dictated a whole paragraph.
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:46.920]   It's gone.
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:47.280]   It's like--
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:48.160]   I'm getting really sick of those dots.
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.840]   It's like I never did anything.
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:51.360]   I just did work.
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:52.080]   It's your turn.
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:53.280]   It was a partnership.
[02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:56.240]   I think it's reasonable to say it isn't widely acknowledged
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:57.360]   as Siri as a flop.
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:57.920]   And the fact that--
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:59.280]   That's just not nearly as great as everybody's.
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:02.360]   --is saying Scott Forestall's flops, maps, and Siri.
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.960]   I understand what you're saying, Brian.
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:06.520]   Well, really, was Siri such a flop?
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:07.440]   Well, I'll tell you what, man.
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:08.560]   It's something I've wanted.
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.400]   I mean, if you go back to listening to one of my first
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:12.680]   appearances on this week in tech, it was like, all I wanted
[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:15.160]   was that microphone button on the keyboard
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:17.080]   so that I could start voice dictation.
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:19.680]   And it took years for it to get there now that it's here.
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:20.720]   I'm thrilled.
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:21.720]   But--
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:23.320]   I think I would--
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:25.560]   I would say he was not fired over maps.
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:26.400]   No, I think it was--
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.840]   That's convenient, but that's not what he--
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:30.960]   Yeah, I mean, I think it was just-- it was everything.
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:34.680]   And I think that there was really a power vacuum going on
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.280]   in Apple.
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:37.440]   And there still will be, and there still is.
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:38.520]   We've seen this before.
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:40.400]   Remember, Google did a reorganization,
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:43.080]   and somebody was left out of that, a woman named Marissa Meyer.
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:44.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:46.560]   She was pushed down very far.
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:50.480]   Yeah, it's not unusual, especially with a new CEO,
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:52.880]   in this case Larry Page, in this case Tim Cook,
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:54.520]   to come in and put a stamp on a company.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:55.600]   Say, these are the people I trust.
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:56.560]   This is how I'm going to--
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:58.480]   And the organization is going to be a little bit different
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:08:59.880]   because I'm not Steve Jobs.
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:00.520]   Correct.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:03.200]   And Apple, of course, wants to make sure that people know
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:04.880]   that it is run by Tim Cook.
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:06.160]   That's really the bottom line.
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:07.160]   That makes sense.
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:08.240]   Yeah, you've got to--
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:10.040]   He's got to sacrifice some of it.
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:13.520]   Every new king has to come in and establish dominance.
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:14.520]   Well, there's another--
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.080]   And sacrificing a high ranking member of the family
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:19.120]   to make it clear.
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:21.000]   And now you're one on Tyrion Lannister on this.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.320]   You're just telling him like this, like Zygros.
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:24.200]   It's got a role.
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:25.560]   You've got to always pay your debts.
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:28.760]   All right, so let's do a little foreshadowing here.
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:32.160]   So Scott Forstol, he ran a very large part
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:33.880]   of an organization at one of the biggest companies in the world.
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:34.800]   Oh, he works for me now.
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:37.960]   Where is-- after he works for Bartol today, where does he go now?
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:39.600]   What is next for Scott Forstol?
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:41.840]   Is he going to develop the next lighting company?
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:42.960]   Because it's based on two more--
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:43.800]   Two more fake designs.
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:44.760]   Do you like you?
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:45.600]   You.
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:46.440]   Phillips Hue.
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:47.440]   I don't know what to talk about.
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:48.440]   What do we think?
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:49.440]   Oh, oh, oh.
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:51.360]   All right, Phillips has created a--
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:51.960]   it's very expensive.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.720]   $200 for three light bulbs.
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:57.240]   But you have to get a kit that attaches to your ethernet.
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:58.720]   And controls the light bulbs.
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:00.480]   You could take a picture of something with your iPhone
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:01.720]   and say, I want this color.
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:03.520]   It's their RGB light bulbs.
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:05.960]   And they will change the room to the color of the thing.
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:08.360]   I take a picture of you, Baritone, my room is dark.
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:09.080]   The hue Phillips.
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:10.560]   I'm looking this up.
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:11.560]   Because you come in.
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:14.560]   And the
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:15.560]   room can look like Baritone day.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.560]   Well, I mean, obviously, the nation and the world have been
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:19.560]   clamoring for this for a decade.
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:21.560]   Outside of that single, you know, world establishing--
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:22.560]   I think it's very interesting.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:23.560]   It's a little pricey.
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.560]   But the idea that you could--
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:27.560]   it's program any color in your lights.
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:29.560]   And control it with your iPhone.
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:30.560]   I'm not selling you never mind.
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:31.560]   I'm--
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:33.560]   Forgive me on the list of demands of my life.
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:34.560]   Like, who's the wrong light?
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.560]   Next time I bring a girl back to my place,
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:38.560]   it's just like, it's so nice and you're looking at it.
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:40.560]   It is an official or a single man.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.560]   Make it back on the list.
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:42.560]   It's going to run this Sunday.
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:43.560]   Hue lighting.
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:44.560]   Yes, but you can sell that.
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:45.560]   You can sell that.
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:46.560]   You can sell that.
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:47.560]   How is Hue spelled, actually?
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:48.560]   HUE.
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:49.560]   Hue.
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:50.560]   It's on the Apple Store.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:51.560]   Hue Phillips.
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:52.560]   Search for Philips with 1L.
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:53.560]   What?
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:54.560]   Philips Hue.
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:57.560]   Because the thing is, is I can't get the lighting on these lights
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:58.560]   in the studio, right?
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:00.560]   So I always end up looking pinker when I'm here.
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:03.560]   And of course, they make fun of me incessantly in the chat room.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:06.560]   But when I'm there in the studio, I look normal.
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:08.560]   But here I look like a pink monster.
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:09.560]   So I'm going to get these.
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:12.200]   I've ordered it, but these are three months out.
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.560]   But the reason I know about this is we use RGB lights here.
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:16.600]   They're very expensive professional lighting.
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:20.080]   But we can make the backdrop, for instance, any color that we want.
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:21.080]   It's purple right now.
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:23.080]   I can switch it to blue.
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:24.080]   There you go.
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:25.080]   That's leaking.
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:26.080]   You've lost me.
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:27.080]   I'm literally checking.
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:28.080]   You know, right now.
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:29.080]   You're putting a tunde chat.
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:30.080]   I do not like, you know.
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:31.080]   Just see if, Chad's going to see if you can do Barret Tunde.
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:34.000]   Look at more things than my knees working on it.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000]   So I'm going to, I'm going to.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.360]   You realize there's no way for Chad to do anything and not getting serious
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.360]   trouble for it.
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:40.360]   Are we having a racial moment?
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:41.360]   We are.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.360]   So I think, is this time to take over the show?
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:45.360]   I think it's time.
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.360]   So Leo, don't you have a flight to catch?
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:48.360]   Yeah, let's watch out very well.
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:49.360]   I'm going to occupy the show.
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:50.360]   It's back.
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:51.360]   Occupied.
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:52.360]   You did that last.
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:53.360]   We did not do that last.
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.360]   That was amazing.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:55.360]   We could do that.
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:57.160]   I'll do after I do the last commercial.
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:58.160]   I'll get up and leave.
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:11:59.160]   Okay.
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:00.160]   Cool.
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:01.160]   And you're in charge.
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:02.160]   Right.
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:03.160]   Should we debate the elections?
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:04.160]   I could be.
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:05.160]   I want to go back to the stand.
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:06.160]   You're voting for Romney.
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:07.160]   We know already that you throw a bomb.
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:08.160]   I'm going to be very Johnson.
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:09.160]   You should not vote.
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:13.960]   And so I recommend, if you're in a lost state where it's already decided, the worst thing
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:14.960]   you ever heard.
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:17.160]   I'm going to write in Scott Forstoll on my ballot.
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:18.560]   You know who's in the California ballot?
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:20.160]   I don't know if she's on anybody else's.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:21.760]   We got Rosanne Barr on our ballot.
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:22.760]   Oh yeah.
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:23.760]   Yeah.
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:24.760]   Peace and freedom party.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:25.760]   There you go.
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:26.760]   No, Brian, that's the tragedy of the commons.
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:27.760]   That's a common fallacy.
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:30.000]   Actually, I'm working on a project right now.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.040]   So as you know, and some most people know, I left the onion some months ago and started
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:35.040]   a company.
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.040]   And we miss you.
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:37.920]   So I'm now an entrepreneur and it's called Cultivated Wit.
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:40.720]   We do comedy tech projects and we're doing this thing with Ford Foundation.
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:41.960]   So as you know, call it quit.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:42.960]   I am okay.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.800]   It's definitely not going to be called.
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:46.800]   So were you coming for?
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:47.800]   No, no.
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:48.800]   Ford Foundation is a client.
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:49.800]   Ford.
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:50.800]   Wow.
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:53.640]   And we're doing this comedic shaming of non-voting friends.
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:54.640]   Thank you.
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:55.640]   Shame on you, Schwood.
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:56.640]   Oh, don't know.
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:57.640]   Shame on.
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:58.640]   I can't even hear you.
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:12:59.640]   I don't say, don't say, don't.
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:03.200]   First of all, everyone should know and vote on all of their local issues.
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:04.200]   Thank you.
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:05.200]   And nobody does.
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:06.200]   Everyone votes in the one election.
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:07.360]   Because it's so confusing.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:08.360]   What is prop 1274?
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:13.280]   Oh, it's so confusing to operate a supercomputer in my hand every day.
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:15.880]   I'm going to show you guys the one side you need to know.
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:16.880]   Okay.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:17.880]   Okay.
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:18.880]   We're about to get the school here.
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:19.880]   This is just the one that you need to know.
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:20.880]   You've heard of Wikipedia.
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:23.280]   This is ballotpedia, ballotpedia.org.
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:24.280]   Go to your state.
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:26.520]   For instance, the ballot measures, Nick, you're saying in California.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:27.640]   Yes, very confusing.
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:29.520]   Click on California ballot measures.
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:30.520]   They list them all.
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:31.680]   They list what they say.
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:34.240]   They list who spent money, pro and con.
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:35.240]   They give all the editorial.
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:36.240]   Well, look at that.
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:38.880]   This is nonpartisan and really good.
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:39.880]   How to be Wikipedia.
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:41.480]   Yeah, it's Wikipedia for voting.
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:44.200]   And I just wish everybody who's voting on Tuesday.
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:46.640]   Well, this doesn't have the thing.
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:48.120]   There's no.
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.040]   We live in a time where there's literally no excuse.
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:52.040]   They're very fair.
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:53.040]   You're a baby.
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:54.040]   I get it.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:55.040]   If you're deceased, I get it.
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:56.040]   But you know what happened?
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.040]   I gave you an example.
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:58.040]   I gave you an example.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:06.080]   In California, if you read the voters ballot, there's a proposition 34.
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:09.800]   It's called death penalty in the ballot.
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:11.000]   And you vote yes or no.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.720]   Now, what do you think a yes vote does?
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:14.360]   That you're for the death penalty.
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:15.360]   No.
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:16.360]   No, you're not.
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:17.360]   Yes, you're not.
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:19.520]   You're saying you're voting yes to repeal the death penalty.
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:24.360]   But on the ballot, it says proposition 34 death penalty initiative.
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:25.360]   Yes or no?
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:26.360]   What do you vote?
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:30.160]   So if you wait until you go to the ballot booth to decide what you're going to do, it's
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:31.160]   too late.
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:32.160]   You screwed up.
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:33.160]   Yeah.
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:35.040]   This is the exact problem I have with all of these.
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:37.320]   Everybody needs to vote initiatives and I love you, Baratundi.
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:38.320]   Please don't be mad at me.
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:39.320]   I agree.
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:41.160]   I'm just straight up California royally.
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:42.160]   I agree with that.
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:46.160]   Again, a side effect is that is you get uneducated voters out there.
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:49.280]   And by the way, when I say don't vote, I mean don't vote for either of the two major
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:50.280]   parties.
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:54.880]   They're totally yes, but if you, but if no one voted for the two major parties, but
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:57.560]   three people voted, someone would win.
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.440]   And that's not so important to vote.
[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:04.000]   Even if you live in a non swing state, you want to keep voting so it doesn't become a
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000]   swing state.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:06.000]   Because that's annoying.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:07.000]   There you go.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.000]   Hit with all these ads.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.600]   Because as it comes down to right now, Ohio decides who the president of the United
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.400]   States is every single time.
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:17.800]   Why, if you're not in Ohio, you should vote for some third party, any third party, because
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:20.160]   your vote matters thousands of times more.
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:22.440]   I will see this is why I love you.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:26.720]   Because that that is a principled and reasonable and like sensical thing to say.
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:30.200]   And I will vote the way I want to, which probably not the way you would, but we're
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:32.280]   participating and that makes a whole ton of sense.
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:36.960]   So funny, if you have, you have, or Terry and Brian brushwood is advocating government
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:39.080]   by Fiat instead of democracy.
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:42.080]   I don't know what that means.
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:43.080]   It sounds very intelligent.
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:44.080]   I didn't hear that at all.
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:47.240]   But I heard a saying that you should be in the democratic process.
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:48.240]   No, okay.
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.560]   So what I'm saying is, first of all, we have a problem.
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:52.160]   The problem is our two party system.
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:55.360]   That's one party more than the communist had and that didn't work out so well for them.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.360]   You hate freedom.
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:57.360]   We now have them in collusion.
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:58.360]   You hate freedom.
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:01.800]   The debates together, they decide what isn't as an off the table.
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:02.800]   So here you go.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:05.120]   Here's the headline on the New York Times.
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:08.320]   "Democrats sued to extend Florida's voting early."
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:12.760]   So here we are again back as we were eight years ago.
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:14.960]   Well, you know what Florida did?
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:17.160]   They decided they used to have this great system.
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:18.160]   Yeah.
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:21.960]   A lot of states have basically restricted your ability to vote this time around.
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:27.320]   And it's mainly because poor working class voters can make the polls on Tuesday.
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:28.320]   Yeah, they do big.
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:33.800]   So by doing so, they misinferate the whole movement called Y Tuesday, which challenges
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:36.280]   why we even force this to happen in the Tuesday.
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:37.280]   Give us some months.
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:42.920]   If any truly freedom loving entity party person, whatever, once maximum participation, it makes
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:43.920]   the system more legitimate.
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:45.520]   So if you're fighting to reduce participation.
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:46.520]   And don't get started about the electrical college.
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:48.360]   You're on the wrong side of history.
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:53.200]   Because thanks to electricity, Tesla, my point is your excuse sucks.
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:54.680]   So can I ask you sucks.
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:55.680]   Can I ask you sucks.
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:56.680]   That's all I have to say.
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:16:57.680]   I'm going to let you guys take over.
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:16:59.840]   Go ahead and then I'll come back and do an ad.
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:00.840]   We're going to take over.
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:04.920]   I'm actually going to make a request that people out there go and not only vote, but
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:08.640]   also go and donate to the Red Cross or something like that for hurricane Sandy.
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:09.640]   I did $50 iTunes.
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:10.640]   Let me just push a button.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:11.640]   There you go.
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:12.640]   That's the easiest one.
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:13.640]   iTunes is great.
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:14.640]   It was great.
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:15.640]   I would have to pick a button.
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:16.640]   They didn't even have to give them any money.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:17.640]   It was great.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:18.640]   Well, you gave money.
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:19.640]   They have your money already.
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:20.640]   They have your money.
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:21.640]   You know what really works?
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:22.640]   Apple actually has all your money.
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:23.640]   Yes.
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:25.640]   And when you spend it elsewhere, you have a license.
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:26.640]   Exactly.
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:27.640]   You have your money.
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:28.640]   It's holding an escrow in your behalf.
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:29.640]   Exactly.
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:30.640]   You know they already got it.
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:31.640]   They have all of the money.
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:36.760]   Apple, the amount of money that Apple has in the bank is $17.50 for every human being
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:37.760]   on planet Earth.
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:38.760]   Wow.
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:41.160]   Well, I hope you've enjoyed this travel back through time.
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:43.840]   I want to thank Chad Johnson for editing all that together.
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:44.840]   That was a lot of work.
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:50.680]   For all of you who went to twit.tv/bestof to suggest moments from the past year of Twit,
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:55.320]   we've got best ofs for a number of our other shows including Mac Break Weekly and Twig.
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:59.520]   What can I invite you as you watch the shows throughout 2013?
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:02.160]   We're going to keep that page up and anytime you see something, gee, that really ought
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:03.360]   to be in the year ender.
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:07.200]   Go to twit.tv/bestof and you can make a note of it.
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:11.680]   I think it's almost time for the 8-bit fire to...
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:13.240]   I didn't see those toes.
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:16.080]   I think it's time for the 8-bit fire to wrap up in a moment.
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:17.760]   So maybe I better wrap this up.
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:22.320]   I just want to thank you so much for your support throughout 2012.
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:30.320]   One of the biggest joys and pleasures of doing Twit and all of our shows...
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:31.320]   You see, I've got to go now.
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:38.880]   The fireplace in it is that the community that surrounds it and the support you've given
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:46.480]   us, helping us build this beautiful studio every day in the chatroom, the emails, the
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.400]   donations.
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:52.920]   It's very gratifying personally to me and I feel like I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:58.320]   I really am so grateful to all of you for supporting what we do here at Twit.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:01.400]   I'm following my bliss and without your help I couldn't do it.
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:03.720]   So thank you very much.
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:05.800]   I hope you have a wonderful new year.
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:07.360]   Stay safe.
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:09.400]   Don't get out on the road after tippling a little bit.
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:10.840]   All right, just take care of yourself.
[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:18.120]   We want you all back next year for many more episodes of This Week in Tech to come.
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:22.120]   Happy Holidays to you all safe and same New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:24.120]   And I'll see you in 2020.
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.120]   I'm Leo LePort.
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:27.120]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:28.120]   Another Twit.
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:35.120]   Take care of yourself.
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:36.120]   Do it!
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:46.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
