[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.060]   It's been a while, but I love coming back every time. I love having you senior editor at Engadget
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.780]   Moved to from his he's no longer a Brooklyn hipster
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.860]   He's sorry. Yes. Yeah. Well
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.820]   If you're in peach, what is it peach tree gardens? What is it peach tree corners?
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.380]   Everything is peach tree in Georgia in your Atlanta
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.540]   But I'm in Georgia right outside of Atlanta in pre-street corners
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.940]   Which is a cute little suburb right below the river there? Do they have artisanal pickle makers in peach tree corners?
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.460]   There are a lot there breweries
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.860]   It's all the stuff in Brooklyn and actually a lot of great international food to you because there's it's a huge immigrant population down here
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.860]   So
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.420]   Interfeasing Korean and Chinese and everything you took Brooklyn with you. So that's good
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.180]   Yeah, it's a state of mind. It's hotter in hell there, right?
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.940]   It is but I think actually New York was hotter for a while like some nights
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.300]   I was talking to some friends. It was like near mid 90s at night. It's you know, it was setting. Yeah, I hate it
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.380]   But yeah, it's always hot here in general. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's great to have you to vindra and congratulations on the move
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.660]   I think that's great
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.740]   Larry that trip. Yeah, it was a trip
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:23.100]   Did you didn't you do like the jodes and get a pickup truck put all your furniture in the back granny sit on the rocking chair in the back
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.500]   See it's a long story the move essentially like we were packing up until the movers came
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.740]   Which is not what you want to be doing and then we have a baby and yeah, it's tough
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.060]   So we flew during covid with a baby and two cats and it was not fun
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.380]   flew with cats
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.740]   with cats
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.460]   My wife always says if we have fires right now, she says we have to evacuate you can go you and Michael go in one car
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.460]   I'll go in another car with the cats
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.500]   She said no one should have to suffer
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.940]   With the cats
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.260]   Did you sedate them a little bit a little bit?
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:07.500]   Just like freaked out kitty brandy like yeah, they they like basically went to a state of shock and anxiety and just like didn't move
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.940]   But they were right under our seats during the flights. It was all at nightmare sounds horrible sounds like a nightmare
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.540]   But you're there now and the cats are they acclimated?
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.940]   They're great. They love having a whole house to run around no longer like a cramped apartment and everything
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.220]   And you haven't let them out yet because they'll run away. They'll try to get back to Brooklyn
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.020]   Maybe they're too scared to go outside. We have a nice little deck
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.940]   Oh, good. They're too scared to go out there now. They're terrified. They're terrified. That's awesome
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.940]   Also with us Larry maggot who has also made a little bit of a move source last time you were here
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.040]   You just left CBS news radio. You are now a regular on BBC the world service as well as
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.580]   I see you on Forbes all the time and he's yeah, I'm on world news television
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.040]   Which is very interesting going from radio to television
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.460]   I I look much better on radio than I do on TV, but you know you do what you have to do
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.140]   But I see you've upgraded your wardrobe for the television. Oh absolutely
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.720]   Well, I upgraded my wardrobe for you Leo if this were BBC
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.140]   I would literally be wearing a
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.320]   Suit coat and a tie and a shirt over my shorts. Yeah, and now I'm because it's you I'm wearing a short sleeve shirt over my shorts
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.240]   And then you get the baby coming the room in the little wheelie thing and the wife kind of baby
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.240]   I would
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.840]   Great to see you Larry
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.420]   And also from WB you are in Boston where he is now the executive producer for podcast mr. Ben Brock Johnson
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:40.160]   Hey Ben hello, it's good to be back coming to you from a wicked awesome piss Duncan donuts
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.960]   I'm not you know, I don't have divindress peach
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.720]   Association, but you know I can get Baston you get the Baston
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:56.540]   That's awesome. See he's actually not from Boston directly you commute in from Western Massachusetts and it turned out
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.340]   That all three of this panel
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.720]   Has lived in your neighborhood your neck of the woods at one time or another divinder for college
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.900]   Larry when did you live there when you were? Oh, I live there from like 72 to 81
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.420]   I got my doctorate from UMass and I taught at UMass
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.580]   Oh nice a lot of time in that lovely area in fact
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.420]   I once had a job offer to to work in North Hampton and I wish I had taken it, but yeah
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:27.580]   Here I am in California Western Massachusetts heavily wooded. It's beautiful. It's where Tanglewood is
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.860]   It's my my grandma had a house in Western Massachusetts
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.140]   So we just the magic time it's magic. Oh, I bet it's beautiful. It's like fruit coming off the trees
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.580]   It's great get those tomatoes go down to the fruit stand get some tomatoes
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.980]   The corn's popping right now
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.820]   Literally and figurative. Oh, that sounds good
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:53.660]   I don't you know, I was saying before the show. I don't really care about any of the stories from this week
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.660]   So I think we should just wrap it up and I
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.260]   Don't know sometimes you get weeks just hang out for an hour. Yeah, maybe we should just talk about things because
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.180]   Maybe it's that it's also grim
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.700]   That I don't really want to talk about it now apple apple really has walked it
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.380]   this is actually we probably should talk a little bit about this because
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.980]   opinions very dramatically on it
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:23.820]   Apple and epic of course in a big battle and then apple got another kind of black mark
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:31.060]   When WordPress the founder of WordPress a good friend Matt Mullenweg
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.300]   We're we're big fans of WordPress and automatic his company
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:40.780]   Matt Mullenweg tweeted heads up on why our iOS app WordPress iOS
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:47.780]   Updates have been absent. We were locked by the app store to be able to ship updates and bug fixes again
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.620]   We had to commit to support in app purchases
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:58.720]   So the app has always been free. It's an app you use to monitor your WordPress site to post on it to check
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.460]   Comments and things like that. It's really good app. I use it. You also use the login
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.980]   WordPress as free sites, but they also offer paid sites
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.780]   And apparently now there's more this is a this story is an evolving story
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.860]   So but this is how it started with his tweet. He says I know why this is problematic
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:25.420]   Open to suggestions should I allow others in app purchases? Should we have a new name?
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:33.580]   He believed that the issue from Apple was that he had in app per he did not have in app purchases for the paid accounts on WordPress
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:42.820]   Apple then responded. No, no, no, it was a mistake on our part. It's because in the app you advertise you mention
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:48.780]   The paid accounts on WordPress calm, but you don't give users the opportunity to buy those
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.140]   You either need to you have two ways to go on this
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.900]   You either need to offer them a way to buy an app and of course Apple takes us 30%
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.900]   Or you need to take any mention of the fact that you have a paid service off of the app
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.860]   at which at which point
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.060]   WordPress did that and
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.780]   The whole thing kind of went away
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:17.020]   But it does raise these issues in this case I think Apple
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.980]   You know they made a mistake. Maybe they should have been this has been a constant complaint about the app store
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.700]   They're not very clear about why they do what they do
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:30.300]   Apple apologized and said, you know, you don't have to add
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.140]   Purchases we apologize. We believe the issue with the WordPress app has been resolved
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:41.060]   This is the quote since the developer removed the display of their service payment options from the app
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.260]   It's it's now a free standalone app and does not have to offer in app purchases
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.980]   We've informed the developer and apologize for any confusion
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.980]   So let me make the case for Apple and I'll let you guys shoot at me
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:58.860]   Since Tim's not sitting here. I might as well be the Tim Cook of the panel the case is and I understand this Apple says
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.580]   Look a user's using this and
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.100]   sees in the app
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.380]   There is a paid tier but has no way to do it
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.340]   Do we think that's a bad experience for users?
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.140]   You either should if you're gonna tell people about it offer it or not offer it at all
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.820]   What's wrong with that Larry I?
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.500]   Well, first of all
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:27.380]   This is a big issue for me because if you look at any other platform besides mobile
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.300]   At least any popular platform IE Windows and Mac
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:39.020]   Pretty much anybody can develop an app and put it out there and they're they're on their own right Apple had the brilliant idea of the app store
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.460]   They it was a great idea still a great idea. It brings them a lot of money
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.660]   but in the words of
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.460]   Steve Jobs, it's an orifice it you know jobs when he when he announced the iPhone talked about the
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:57.380]   The telephone companies being orifice is well Apple is an orifice in that it is the blockage
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.540]   It is the way in which the only effective way in which you can get an app to run on their platform
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:07.380]   And so there's a lot of issues. This is just one of them one of the monetization is one of them the other is
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:13.780]   Their decisions to that apps of course. I agree with the security aspect, but you know
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.620]   I remember Steve Jobs saying, you know, we have one too many fart apps and you know
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.140]   He's right. You don't need a lot of fart apps
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.420]   But who is it a apple to tell people you know how much choice they should have on a particular kind of app
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:32.740]   So it really brings up the broader question and a question that kind of came up when Tim Cook along with the heads of Google and Amazon
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.740]   And Facebook were up before Congress
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.460]   But they didn't give him nearly as much of a grilling on this as I think they should have
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.220]   And I'm sorry I cut you off you're about to say something
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:46.820]   I was just gonna say that I was so impressed that I heard orifice blockage and farts
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   Like yeah, but I we always go high when you go low we go high
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.780]   I think it but but I totally agree. I think well, I think I agree
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.940]   I mean I think that the the issue here
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.580]   you know is that
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.540]   Apple is trying to create a better experience for its users
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:12.940]   That's the other side of this two-sided coin, right there Apple is trying to make sure it just works
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.540]   Like when you use their devices and you use their software
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.780]   It just works and so like the WordPress issue
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.580]   I think I think you're right Leo that it's sort of it, you know, you come down on the side of Apple there
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:30.340]   They're trying to improve the user experience, but it's also interesting when that story came out, right?
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.500]   Which is after the epic story so apples, right so apples reaction
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:43.020]   Has to be it is like within this context of this conversation that's been happening for a long time about how
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:51.540]   little app makers and huge app makers get charged this big cut that goes to Apple and I think you know
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.820]   It's tough you it's kind of like you fall on one side or the other right you're either in favor of
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.420]   a great user experience or you're in favor of
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.860]   App companies not getting screwed or at least that's how it's kind of set up
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.540]   It shouldn't be that way, but it's it's tough
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.700]   I I think in the case of WordPress it makes a lot of sense that Apple
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.860]   You know wanted an app purchase stuff to be available
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.220]   But at the same time you you look at it as part of the bigger picture and at least to me
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:30.860]   it seems like in trying to create this kind of perfect ecosystem where or marketplace where people can purchase software
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.060]   Apple has now become kind of the big bad guy
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:42.740]   It's kind of funny that Larry should invoke how it happens on desktops because Apple also invokes that
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.020]   In their defense
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:53.140]   Because they compare the marketplace for software and desktops to the marketplace for software
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:15:00.180]   On iOS and they say see how chaotic it is and you have to have a distributor and the and the distributors took more than 30%
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.620]   We take a very small reasonable cut for our services including
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.140]   download bandwidth and and and
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:12.980]   Carefully vetting the apps and so forth. So that's why Apple's telling courts
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:20.700]   We're better the app store is better than the desktop marketplace not worse than the desktop marketplace
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.260]   It's certainly more restrictive and I should also point out that there's some question about
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.940]   whether Apple's response is disingenuous because
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:35.380]   And this is a later story from Sean Hollister in the Verge
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.580]   he says Matt Mullenweg of
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.260]   WordPress says that they'd already
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:49.020]   Stripped out the plans section it wasn't in the current version. There was no mention of paid plans
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.700]   Mullenweg told the Verge that he'd previously offered to strip other mentions of the paid plans out of the app
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:03.020]   Even workarounds like when a user views a preview of their own WordPress webpage and then navigates to WordPress.com and Apple rejected
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:10.700]   Those suggestions so it sounds like Apple realizing it probably wasn't the best optics
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.620]   Decided to back down even though
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:19.460]   Maybe initially they hadn't divindra do you have a sense of what happened? I think it
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.740]   Is the uproar like if Matt Mullen like then tweet about the situation and tell us what was happening
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.300]   I'm pretty sure Apple would have just stuck to its guns
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:34.660]   But yeah, the situation is confusing because it's hard for developers to tell how Apple applies its rules sometimes and seems very
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.860]   It's just like
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:42.100]   Cricious. Yeah, it's very opaque and sometimes I've heard from developers like Apple will just say this is how it is
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.820]   Deal with it and you really can't fight back
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:50.900]   And this is the one situation where you know public sentiment and certainly reporting about this is maybe pushed Apple in one direction
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:57.660]   It is weird that yeah, he didn't really have to change anything because he already took away the paid
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:05.380]   Mentions in the app Apple still rejected it which is that that to me is the confusing part like when did why was that the case?
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:10.820]   What is different now and Apple apologizing? That's certainly a new thing for them, especially to a developer
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.380]   Sean Hollister writes Apple
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.380]   Hold on a second. Hold on
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:23.220]   Sean Harris Hollister and Verge writes Apple simply seems to have decided that trying to extract its cut from a free app by
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:30.900]   Forcing in app purchases isn't a hill worth dying on to seriously. Yeah, you know like all right all right
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.980]   I go ahead Larry. Yeah, no, I just want to respond to what you had said
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:40.100]   I mean you're absolutely right that Apple what will say and does say that they're creating a less chaotic better experience
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.860]   And that's probably true, but it's what monopolists have always said if you
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:49.380]   One of their arguments is that we you know if we break up the phone company
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.260]   Everything's gonna you know gonna fall apart and when we need this you know this
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.380]   Paternalistic company to make sure that everybody's got good phone service
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.820]   So I'm not saying that that's completely untrue
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.780]   But it's sort of what I would expect a company like Apple to say and
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:08.300]   There really isn't a free marketplace when it comes to the ability to distribute
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:15.460]   And you know then the question becomes if there were a free marketplace, maybe there would be lower prices, but you know we just don't know
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.580]   Well and that's there's a court case going on
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.580]   About that the class action suit against Apple
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.340]   There are as investigation going on in the EU
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:36.560]   About that certainly it looks like the FTC in the United States is at least considering action on the app store
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.960]   So Apple is definitely facing some heat and then there's this
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.880]   suit between Apple and Epic
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:51.160]   Unfortunately epic and Tim Sweeney don't seem like the ideal poster boys for this freedom. You don't say yeah
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.280]   Yeah, what so what's the letters have rights to Leo come on?
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:19:02.440]   You know this is a very tough one I think it was it's pretty it seems to me
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.060]   I'll I'll posit this and you guys can shoot at it. It seems to me that when Apple started the app store
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:16.280]   Way back, you know a year and a half after the iPhone was introduced remember the the app store was not originally part of the iPhone in fact
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:23.780]   Steve Jobs said oh, you don't need apps. You just use web pages. It's all it's just use web pages by the way that now a day
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:29.000]   Could be true with progressive web apps except that Apple won't support them on iOS very well
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.620]   But he did after a year and a half. I think they said whether was their plan all along or not
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.800]   I don't know okay
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:41.500]   We're gonna create these app store and at the time it seemed like a pretty good deal for developers you got on a very
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:46.100]   Exciting platform you got a chance to ride the success of that platform
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:53.940]   30% was a lot less than England micro or any of the distributors charged to carry your shrink wrapped software on store shelves
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.900]   So you get to keep 70% of the revenue you don't have to pay for downloads
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.100]   You have a it's a good experience for your end user
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.180]   It's a store that works and I think for a long time that was kind of a happy thing
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:13.600]   Developers are making money Apple always points out the billions of dollars. They pay out to developers
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.740]   They don't mention the 30% they they keep but I think over time
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:23.560]   It's gotten so much more complicated that the what what seemed like a benefit in 2010
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.760]   is a little less so today that you have
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.160]   Problems like you have Netflix which charges a fee
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.780]   But Apple doesn't take a cut of the fee and doesn't require Netflix to sell but
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:44.720]   But because it's a streaming thing and then you have X cloud Microsoft's gaming platform in Google's Stadia
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:50.240]   Which are also streaming things they're streaming games, but Apple won't allow them on there because they say no
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:56.460]   That's not streaming all on Netflix. That's a game store and we can't vet the game so we don't want it on there
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:04.280]   It's very easy to look at Apple and say well your motives are purely financial you want 30% of everything
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.560]   That's rent seeking on the other hand. It's also easy to take the point of view
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.920]   Well, Apple's just trying to Apple's built something of value and they're just trying to protect customers
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.840]   I
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.760]   Just think that I think what made sense 10 years ago
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.160]   Doesn't make as much sense today and apples in a difficult
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:26.840]   I think what what did happen and we talked about this last week is Apple didn't think ahead to the
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:32.640]   What would what would happen down the road and now they've painted themselves into a little bit of a corner
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.640]   Is that sent make sense to Vindra?
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.960]   Yes, I think so like and I guess as these companies grow as any
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:45.320]   Market place grows I feel like the rules may need to change or at least the way we look at things the same with Facebook too
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:53.360]   When Facebook was you know a very small college based social network the rules were very different for them compared to now when they have what over two billion
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.160]   Users it seems like things have to evolve along with the size of the market
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.200]   Apple can always say that they're not the biggest mobile platform out there
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.400]   Which is true, but they still have a very big platform of their own and they have a complete monopoly of it
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.800]   And I don't know what we can do certainly the stadium the X-Cloud stuff to me seems like a big issue because
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.040]   People want those things and they may go to Android to get them
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.680]   Apple I'm old enough to remember when Apple was kind of an insignificant player
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.760]   I mean it was not a part of the economy and you know now it's literally a two trillion dollar company
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.480]   It is a huge huge company
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:33.600]   So I think that the rules and the expectations will change and have to change as these companies become dominant
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.280]   You know these are the robber baron well, maybe that's a pejorative term
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.760]   These are the oil companies of our modern era and when I was a kid
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.680]   Everybody hated the oil companies whether whether we should have or not and I think that tech is in for the same ride
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.680]   Well, you when you say when you were a kid
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:55.360]   That's another interesting aspect of this story to me because like I feel like that the four the people were playing Fortnite
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.520]   They a bunch of them hate Apple now, right?
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.560]   and
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.040]   Like there's a really interesting like Apple was the cool company when I was a kid
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.120]   That was like the coolest coolest company hands down the coolest company and I feel like
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:16.520]   For decades and I feel like there are kids now where like just just talking about the epic, you know
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.480]   Effect so to speak like I feel like there are tons of kids now
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.360]   Who are like?
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.920]   Thumbing their nose at Apple being like you guys suck man, you know what I mean?
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.920]   And I just think that's like an interesting
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.040]   Aspects to this as well and it's also someone tweeted
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:39.400]   When the the Fortnite thing was happening someone tweeted like no matter what you do Fortnite will always be better at the internet than you
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.080]   That's a good line. Oh, yeah, I thought it was a good line
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.840]   I think even though they're not necessarily the right poster child for this they are super powerful
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.160]   Especially when it comes to like driving
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:57.840]   Like young consumers to do things right potentially so I think that's like a problem for Apple
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.720]   They should be thinking about I think the biggest problems for Apple are reputational
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:07.320]   Because they also it also doesn't look good because they have Apple arcade. They have their own game system
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:13.720]   It feels like rent-seeking by which I mean Apple didn't create the value of these companies
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.200]   But it wants a percentage of their income anyway
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:23.080]   Just because they can and it certainly speaks to the fact that Apple may not have a monopoly of smartphones
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.920]   but among iPhone users they have an absolute monopoly of
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.100]   Applications there's no other way to put an application on the iPhone
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.960]   So they certainly own that
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.720]   Phil Schiller responds we were starting to see on Friday Apple's response to the
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.160]   Epic lawsuit and
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.320]   the you know the
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:55.000]   Smoking gun that Apple pulled out was the fact that Tim Sweeney has approached Apple at least three times via email looking for a better
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.280]   Deal than others get a sweetheart deal
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.200]   Schiller wrote on June 30th 2020
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:09.840]   Sweeney wrote my colleagues in me in an email asking for a side letter from Apple that would create a special deal for only epic
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.160]   That fundamentally would change the way in which Epic offers apps on the iOS
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.480]   Platform they were asking permission to bypass in-app purchases
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:25.760]   Effectively what you know everybody would like as well as permission to launch a third party store app store
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:33.680]   For iPhones and this is I think one of the undercurrents here everybody thinks that epic wants its own
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:40.000]   Steam-like store and they want to put it on iOS and that's a clear violation of what Apple will allow
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.600]   Schiller said Sweeney
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:48.160]   Said it will know you know said look we're not going to do it. We're not going to adhere to the payment processing
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:55.040]   Uh Sweeney wrote in the email because of restrictions imposed by apple epic is unable to provide consumers with certain features
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.640]   In our iOS apps so you need to give us
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:06.960]   A side letter or alter your contracts and standards documents to restrict remove those restrictions that prevent us from having a competing app store
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.560]   And competing payment processing options to iOS. We hope that apple will also make these options
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.440]   Equally available to all iOS developers
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.960]   Uh, and that's what Sweeney said is we're not fighting this fight for ourselves. We're not asking for damages
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.080]   We're not asking for money from apple. We're trying to get an opener a more open ecosystem
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.720]   Sure, which is almost sure. Yeah
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:36.960]   Uh, it'll be really it'd be really interesting a hearing coming monday
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.600]   In the north of the district of california because epic has requested a restraining order
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.240]   That would put a fortnight back on the app store and we uh the hearing for that is monday
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.040]   So this may uh happen very quickly
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.160]   I'm what do you think you think the court will be receptive to the things remember the court
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.920]   Doesn't have the same dog in this hunt that we do that gamers do that fortnight players do
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:06.880]   I don't know if that's an advantage or disadvantage for apple at this point. I don't know exactly where the court will come down on this
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.560]   Yeah, it seems like a difficult thing to explain right it's very um
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.720]   Well, we should say that this is the northern district their technocle- they're technically savvy
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:25.200]   I think it's judge lucy co who has a lot of experience in tech issues. She did apple and samson. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, so she she's been here before and so
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.360]   You know, you can't say well a card doesn't know anything about this stuff. They do
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.080]   Uh, i'm not sure about epic's push for another app store
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.280]   But certainly the way apple carves out deals with other companies like we know amazon has a sweetheart deal
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.520]   You know for the amazon app
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.160]   And amazon also does the thing where the kindall app you can't buy books on ios right?
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.880]   You have to do that on the web or some way
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.200]   But apple deal give amazon a sweetheart deal on amazon prime
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.160]   Yep, one of three companies only
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.600]   That has that deal and this was apple and you know what?
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:05.280]   Companies are allowed to make side deals that benefit them. They said all right. We'll let you
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:12.400]   Offer amazon prime without in app purchases, but we want amazon prime on apple tv. That's the tit for tat
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   Uh, i don't took forever by the way, but it was a tough negotiation. Yeah
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:25.840]   So apple does allow exceptions at least in three cases. I think alcatel and france is another
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.160]   exception
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.520]   There are there are three cases where apple doesn't charge in app purchases
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.000]   Um
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.160]   And apple could certainly make i think apple i think what's going to happen here whether it happens
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:43.760]   Uh at the order of the court or just because the times have changed apple does need to rethink how it does this
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:50.880]   It's also, I mean the anti-trust conversation happening in dc right like there's there's
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:58.400]   Not that that would necessarily sway a judge, but it's kind of in the ether right now, right?
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:04.880]   Yeah, oh, yeah, but uh, well actually let me correct myself first. It was it's not uh lucy co. I thought it was
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.880]   It's a judge gunzallis
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.880]   Uh yvonne konszallis roger's i'm sorry
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.520]   Um, so but again the north this northern district knows tech they that they deal with
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.840]   a lot of yeah, um, I think
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.560]   Here's the problem. We're also in an election year. We're only
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.520]   Two or three months away from an election. We have a fairly chaotic
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:31.200]   Uh federal government right now that is dealing with a lot of other things besides anti-trust
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.480]   I I don't think at this point
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.920]   Anybody could put their finger to the wind and know what the federal government is going to do about anything
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.360]   Apple must buy tick-tock now
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.120]   The only way
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.880]   Yeah, so it's not even i'm not even making a political statement about
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.200]   I just saying that if you're trying as a business leader trying to figure out what where the winds blow
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.400]   You might want to wait till january
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.520]   Absolutely
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.000]   I don't know if it'll be more favorable for you. It depends what happens
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.280]   Uh, if trump wins again, he's going to have a much stronger mandate and he's going to be able to do
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   more of what he wants to do
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.800]   Uh, which is unpredictable. Unfortunately if uh, biden wins, uh, it's also unpredictable
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.360]   He's come out against things like section 230
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.240]   So it's it's not known where he stands on this stuff
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:32.160]   And he's also appropriating a lot of warren's platform and there's a lot of like fighting against the trust for her
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.280]   So warren said apple should be broken up. Yep. Yep
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.000]   So you could actually go to a much more hostile environment
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.200]   Uh in january, no all new justice department all new uh white house or
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:51.760]   And uh, you know, I have to I feel for tech executives over the last couple of years because
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.800]   A lot of it has to do with hobnobbing. They all have had to go to white house and and
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.000]   Talk to the president and and and argue their case
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.840]   sometimes
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:07.920]   And it really doesn't even it's not clear what what the criteria, you know, it's shift me over a day
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.360]   For better or worse. I don't think biden is going to be that tough on tech or any other part of quote
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.800]   That's the other thing. I mean right now tech is our savior
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.200]   Right, right
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.040]   Is this some extent
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.240]   Is it? Uh
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.520]   2016 has a few words to say I feel like tech completely failed us for that election
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.040]   Okay
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.840]   Okay, but here i'll make my case and you can make the countercase
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.640]   My case is in the year of covid if we didn't have technology we'd be right rude
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.160]   a
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   All the educations happening through zoom
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.440]   Uh much of the work from home if you were lucky enough to be working is technology and by the way
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:53.040]   If there is an economic engine left running this country, it's tech you you know, we I was talking about the s&p 500
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:59.760]   Which had a record setting week. It actually the s&p 500 is above its february benchmark
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:06.320]   It's the highest it's ever been and you go. Oh my god. The stock market's going crazy until you realize that if you take out
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.680]   five companies facebook amazon apple
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.680]   um
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   google google and
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.160]   microsoft
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.200]   If you take those out the s&p 500 lost 6 percent over the last six months
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:28.880]   The all of the growth is happening with the five biggest tech companies that's apple two trillion dollar company all of that
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.240]   so
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.560]   I mean i'm not saying that the stock market is by any means a bellwether of the american economy
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:40.240]   But if there is a bright spot, it's there if there is if there are companies that are making money if there are companies that are hiring people
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.480]   If there are there are benefits
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.920]   They're benefiting from the fact that we're all stuck at home or many people are stuck at home and we're seeing like yeah
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.880]   white collar
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:54.400]   Workers are doing really well in this like during this whole situation their stocks are going up. Uh, they're working from home
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.440]   um
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   There are issues. Certainly
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.760]   I just I feel like we can't just say tech is our savior
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.360]   They're they're gaining from the weird situation we're in right now
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.440]   But at the end of the day, what are what are zoom calls except, you know
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:15.440]   These Skype stuff and the google hangouts. We've been doing forever. I don't think zoom is fundamentally better as a platform
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:23.040]   The difference is you and I we've been doing it forever, but uh, you know now it's it's us and everybody's grandmother
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.840]   That's doing it forever every school kid is doing it. I mean the the covid really has
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.120]   Fundamentally changed our relationship to technology to the point where it is truly integrated
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.320]   Into the lives of the average american including older americans not just kids today, you know, we're on their phones
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.200]   It's everybody is dependent on tech even to order your food or your groceries
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.000]   I mean, uh, I essentially don't go to a store
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.280]   So virtually everything that comes into my house comes via the internet and in a delivery truck from amazon
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.880]   Or or somewhere else. So if the president wants to celebrate a v-shaped recovery
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.160]   Uh, he's he's gonna have to acknowledge that tech is
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:05.920]   Is if not all a huge portion of that and that for him is important to his election
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.320]   Prospects and the future
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.600]   Uh, so I you know, I it's weird because we are going after tech
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:18.240]   Or not we they congress is going after tech and I would say we because I think it's justified in some cases
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.960]   Uh google and facebook particularly wield enormous power
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:29.520]   In the well beyond what they probably should but it's also difficult to know how to go after tech
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.240]   If that's the things driving your economy forward. I mean, yeah, I don't think it's fair
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.120]   It's unfair to just say hey guys. What are you doing? Let's look at some of this antitrust behavior
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:45.680]   What it the way facebook handles misinformation? I think is something we've been focusing on they're finally starting to do something about it
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.480]   But man, I sure would have liked to see this four or five years ago
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.760]   Um before it potentially ruined an election in america and kind of led us down a very weird path
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.600]   Really you said the f-word so let's take a break and when we come back we uh, I think that there is something
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.920]   There's a lot to be said about facebook and the problems it presents
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:11.760]   In particular, uh, the power that mark succerberg has not because he has 60 percent voting power over facebook
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.080]   As a result the power that he has
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.000]   Over not just our politics, but the politics of the world
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.520]   And I think this is a very troubling prospect
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.280]   So I do think there's ways to there are things to criticize about technology right now
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.160]   Uh as much as I love it
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.720]   As much as none of us would have jobs if it weren't for technology
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   We don't want to bite the hand that feeds us. Well in amazon is another good example
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:46.240]   Uh, all of this is really done is just solidify amazon's dominance of e-commerce, right?
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.680]   Half the half the vehicles in front of my house or are these new prime delivery family? I mean they are everywhere everywhere
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.040]   Yeah, uh, so we're going to come out of this
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.640]   With a newly emboldened and a newly powerful and it's newly economically successful
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.840]   Group of tech companies microsoft amazon apple
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.480]   Facebook and google
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.640]   And you know they might be it might be to the point where they can thumb their nose at congress to say yeah, right
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.320]   Come get us, baby
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.000]   Let's take a break. We got we got more to talk about great crew here larry man all old friends
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.440]   Which is nice larry maggot from uh now from the bbc
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:32.640]   Whoo, so they're spec. Yeah, you have to be respectful. Yes. I have to yes. Well, notice I'm wearing a black suit today
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.720]   So it's pro-pant all right at all
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.280]   Uh the vendor hard of war
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.160]   Uh from n gadget. It's great to have you and of course spend brock johnson from wb
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.400]   You are in boston where he's now in charge of all podcasts. How many podcasts is that?
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.200]   three, oh
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:37:00.960]   You're getting big, you know where where we've we've um ended a few we've sun sun set a few and then we've got a couple more comments in so
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.640]   You know, I hear I hear up to five. I hear podcasting is uh is this the next big thing I hear
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.200]   Probably public radio. It's it's that's the conversation actually podcasting plus public radio is a very very
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:21.520]   Of beneficial a pair partnership all the best podcasts all the most successful podcasts are public radio aren't they?
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.760]   I think they are well so someone would claim such things but you're og and you've been doing it since 2005
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:34.960]   I have I think and actually I want I want the uh the fact checkers in the chat room to work on this but I think
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.000]   Twig qualifies as the longest running tech podcast of all
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.200]   We started april 28 2005. I don't think there's anything before that that's still going
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.840]   You're the simpsons of tech podcasts
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.080]   Definitely
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.080]   I showed a name brought to you by

[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:26.320]   Why zip recruiter? Well for a lot of reasons first of all of course when you post on zip recruiter

[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.360]   Gave us two weeks notice. My wife is a you know as a financial person so she could do it
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.680]   But she didn't want to do it. She said now what I'm gonna have to do her job. I don't know what I'm gonna do
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.720]   Well, she posted on zip recruiter. This was breakfast
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.800]   Before lunch within an hour or two. She said, oh
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.960]   Look, I got a great. Oh, here's another great candidate. They're rolling in
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.160]   And that's not unusual
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.000]   zip recruiter
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.800]   Is so effective four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter will get quality candidates within the first
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.000]   Day
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   That's that matching process
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.760]   The other thing I like about it makes that entire hiring process efficient
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.800]   Because first of all those applicants don't go into your voice mail or into your email
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.520]   They go in the zipper recruiter interface
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:52.240]   They reformat all the resumes so it's easy to scan them and you have screening questions
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.320]   So you can filter people out multiple choice true false essays, whatever you want
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.120]   The dashboard makes it very easy to screen out the bad candidates
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   Rank the rest pick the best
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:09.680]   It is a very very effective tool. Just go to the website and look at the testimonials
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:15.520]   You'll see all the people and I add our name to the bunch because we've hired many people from zip recruiter
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.200]   It's really our go to

[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.880]   slash twit
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   Should I spell it out for you zip?
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:34.240]   Rec r ui t er.com/twit zip recruiter
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.640]   It's the smartest way to hire and we recommend it and we use it ourselves
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.720]   I read an article. I wish I could find it
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:48.320]   I don't know where it is that posited that really the most powerful person in the world right now is mark zuckerberg
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:54.240]   He's if mark zuckerberg given his absolute control of facebook the board of directors can't say boo
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.640]   Nobody else could say boo. I doubt sharell samberg and say mark you got to knock it off
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.800]   Uh, so with his 60 percent voting shares, he's completely dominant
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:08.960]   And if he decided you know, I don't like this candidate or I don't like this policy
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.680]   It would not be hard for him
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.200]   To modify to to tweak the algorithm in such a way
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   That he could get somebody elected. Do you not agree? Do you not think that's possible?
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.680]   Is there any check on his power at all?
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.440]   There is none right
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.240]   No, that's a ultimate question and what's funny is that
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:34.720]   I don't know you posit this question leo even though we keep learning things like uh facebook's algorithm keeps
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.760]   Bising towards conservatives even though they're the ones complaining that tech is erasing them
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:47.360]   So I don't know who mark zuckerberg is really answering to it seems like the people who shout loudest to me is the people he'll try to appease
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:51.520]   We can speculate that mark's gonna do what'll make him the most money
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.560]   And that right now he's got his finger to the win and he says you know what I better make sure conservatives get an oh outsized voice
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.280]   On facebook because I don't want the white house shutting us down. Look what he's doing at ticktock
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.680]   So you might speculate that but we don't know and we literally
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.840]   The ftc congress no one can stop this guy at this point. Do you think
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.200]   And he just is
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.520]   Go ahead
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.720]   All right. Well, I mean, I just think it's ironic that here we are silicon valley a very very blue area
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:32.080]   I suspect I don't know what mark's politics are but I suspect they're liberal and I I know sharles are
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.760]   I know sharle work with the democratic party yet. They are playing very much into the hand of the conservatives
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.320]   Well look who they hired for their news operation campbell brown who is absolutely conservative
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.960]   Right
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.600]   Yeah, at the same time the conservatives are beating up on them constantly and claiming that they're
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:55.680]   Bringing the election against the conservatives. So it's a weird, you know, I feel like allis and wonderland try to understand this stuff
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:01.440]   Yeah, I will say, I mean, I think our idea is that tech is is kind of liberal and very democratic
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.480]   But honestly for my experience, it's more like more
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:11.120]   Libertarian like more the people who are in the middle who are trying to say oh, we just want fairness
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.280]   You know, we we want the market to be fair. We want we want certain things to be fair
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:22.240]   So they're not necessarily the ones fighting for things like human rights or diversity or equality or equal pay or gender
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.560]   Anything like that. I'm not I'm not even asserting that mark's doing anything wrong
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.960]   I'm just saying there is nothing to stop him from doing so we don't know what he's doing
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.040]   And there is literally nothing that can stop him
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.160]   And i'll give you his own employees his own employee
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:44.000]   Yes, it's basically the only thing I think and and he it seems like some of the reporting at least from the times has suggested that he's getting it from
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.080]   Those employees quite a bit but
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:52.880]   In the stand-ups or whatever the full company meetings or whatever they're doing but but even that I mean you got to have
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:58.160]   Real guts to do that right to stand up to him and give him a hard time
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.000]   So that's pretty unlikely that he'd be stopped by his own
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:10.400]   So that every silicon valley company is somewhat at the mercy of its engineers because engineering talent is unique
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.760]   It's hard to get you spend a lot of energy finding these people
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.000]   It's not an infinite supply, especially with h1b visas being cut back
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.840]   And so it you know, I know google for sure listens to
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.440]   Activists within google because they can't afford to piss them off
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.960]   I don't know if it's the case in facebook. We certainly have heard about
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:35.040]   People I'm and so I just want to be clear. I'm not saying marks liberal or conservative or marks leaning away to the other
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.560]   I'm just saying
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.760]   We don't know and there's no way of I don't know of a good way to stop and maybe it is just the employees
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.840]   That's a very thin blue line
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.400]   Yeah, it's a light blue
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.480]   To me it's sort of like a zuckerberg has always styled himself after bill gates
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.560]   You know and especially in 90s bill gates the bill gates that would go out there the cut
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.760]   Story small company. Yeah, the cut through up bill gates the guy from
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.720]   What was it pirates? This will come valley that movie, uh, which I love it's a fun movie
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.920]   Um, but yeah, the guy who would blow away small competitors copy everybody just be ruthless
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:14.560]   Do what it is he's still doing it with tiktok and being hilariously bad at bringing tiktok features into instagram
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:20.320]   but I'm still waiting for the mark zuckerberg who kind of evolves the way bill gates did as a
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.480]   As a humanitarian as somebody who actually reads books and thinks deeply about
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:33.680]   Um, how to help people in societies issues as a whole and I I think that would be something that would help for zuckerberg
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.880]   But yeah, there's nobody to tell him no at this point. It's terrible
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:43.440]   And one of the problems with facebook is how the algorithms really encourage people to remain in their little cocoon
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:50.160]   So yeah, I'm quite sure that my facebook feed looks dramatically different than a trump supporters facebook feed
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   I mean they were going to see over and over and again trump trump trump trump positive positive
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.240]   My feed looks like a you know democratic coalition meeting
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.800]   Or or even further
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.200]   Information bias
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.560]   It's confirmation bias embodied by the algorithm
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.040]   Say hey, you're gonna be happier if you see stuff you agree with so let's feed right right
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:17.040]   And the scariest thing is this is being weaponized now in the case of like qAnon stuff, right?
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:22.320]   Like that's some of the stuff that's been really wild to see is now facebook's pulling down cute
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.400]   They say they're pulling down qAnon
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.640]   Sure groups and they're blocking qAnon posts
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:32.640]   But it's a little like the what have I don't know it feels like a little bit too little too late, right?
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:37.440]   Like so many I think you could easily make the argument the qAnon look you
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:42.960]   Americans probably humans have loved conspiracy theories for as long as we've been around sure
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:48.000]   Then they've spread like wildfire wherever possible, but facebook made it possible
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.880]   In a in a dramatically more effective way with a much larger potential audience
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:00.000]   And I think you could clearly make the case the qAnon wouldn't be the the conspiracy theory it is today without that without facebook
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.160]   Absolutely and they like all of these in the scary thing
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:09.600]   I think is that the way that so many of these groups function as they're being weaponized by
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.600]   advertising organizations and and you know
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.280]   People who want to fund some of the stuff that's kind of
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:23.360]   Scared at least to me scary and terrifying when it comes to things like anti-vaccine groups and things like that is
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.200]   They really they they've figured out how to do it
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.280]   They've really figured out how to game the system how to bring people in and you know
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.400]   It's people to other groups that are similar. It wasn't that hard
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.720]   You know
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.760]   It's true. It's true. It almost does it by itself
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.720]   Yeah, and in fact, I think you could probably make the case that mark has done nothing
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:51.760]   He's an engineer very smart guy. He's probably done nothing than optimize for engagement and profit. That's all it took
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.920]   Yep
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.320]   But that that is that and that by the way was the startup philosophy for the past 10 years
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.280]   You know for the time I've been covering startups and hyper growth and everybody who wants to you
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.120]   You know build it all costs and move fast and break things which was their
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:13.680]   Uh, you know, zucks philosophy for well. He moved he moved so fast. He broke democracy
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.920]   You know and you're dealing with that right now
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:22.480]   And I think you could argue that that facebook's the best at it because mark so smart and he's hired very smart people and they did a great job
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:29.360]   They did a better job than anybody else's Silicon Valley. Well done. This is the article. It was on one zero
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.680]   Which is a medium
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:38.400]   A blog from jumana abou gazela the unelected monarch and an elected monarch is shaping our public life
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.000]   His name is mark zuckerberg the most important election this year
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:49.040]   Has only this is the other the subheads even more important the most important election this year has only one voter
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:54.160]   And then it's this guy. This is of course the about the most unflattering picture i've ever seen
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:59.920]   Red rimmed robotic eyes with where the flat where the flattering one
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:07.680]   I've never seen this. He's got the soulless gaze of a great white shark bearing down on you
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.520]   Uh, yeah, I know this is his test pretty good in a t-shirt
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.480]   Maybe it's a tie you think
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.760]   Um side of hell
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.840]   If if in jumana starts
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:24.240]   She's the founder of pivot for humanity a nonprofit on a mission to professionalize silicon valley. I don't I don't know who here
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.760]   She is but
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.800]   Start but the elite is pretty if it's if it's not the single most powerful individual position in the world
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:37.520]   It only has a few rivals think general secretary of the chinese communist party or the pope or chair of the us federal reserve
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:44.800]   Maybe the crown prince of souti arabia. It's a position that's been embroiled in a contentious conversation for years now about the scope
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.080]   And possibly criminal misuse of the current incumbents power
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:55.280]   The ability to encourage wars between nuclear powers to rally or slow down global markets to end or initiate
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.560]   horrifying human rights crises around the world, but i'm not talking about a presidency
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:06.640]   We get to elect the president. I'm talking about the ceo of facebook mark zuckerberg and I I
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.120]   I have to say I agree
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.440]   100 and we don't really address this you know
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:18.000]   We're talking about trump banning tiktok and is the chinese government a threat is tiktok a tool of the chinese government is
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.880]   It's spying on us. Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.040]   That's I think
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:30.720]   Diminimus compared to the threat the facebook right in our own backyard poses the calls coming from inside the house
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.240]   I love it
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:41.920]   Yeah, and then that's a fundamental change right from 2016 right that's a fundamental change as we understand how these platforms are
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.620]   impacting some of the biggest
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:50.400]   At least electoral decisions right like i think you can all story was outside influence
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:58.160]   Well, but I think you could say that one of the true success stories of the trump campaign in 2016 was its use of facebook
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.880]   It's brilliant use of facebook
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:06.240]   Facebook ads and facebook actively courted them to buy ads facebook had embedded
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:12.640]   Embedded people in the trump campaign to help them do a better job buying ads of course that's in their business interest
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:18.560]   uh, I it'll be interesting to see what happens at 26 2020 I
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:24.640]   You know, I'm somebody asked me on twig. We were talking about this if you were at a dinner party with zuck
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.600]   What would you if you would tell him to do one thing and he would do it?
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.240]   What would you do? And I'd say we'll not have any political ads, but that's not a perfect solution either
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   That's a small piece of it. Yeah at the risk of of defending king mark
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:40.640]   It is a double edged sword because there's also a lot of progressive activism
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:46.800]   Like the women's marches and the anti gun activities and a lot of positive things that are also happening on facebook
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:51.280]   So again, if you look at my feed, you're gonna see a lot of positivity at least
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.000]   In terms of how I look at the world
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.240]   And that's true with a lot of people and then certainly there have been some good things that have come out of facebook
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.600]   So the question is how did you throw away the baby with the bath?
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.520]   How can you clean this up?
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.120]   And at the same time not take away a tool that progressives are able to use
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.840]   To from where I sit make the world a better
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.640]   Absolutely
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.000]   And you make the same uh case with twitter that it's been used
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.400]   By black lives matter and the arab spring and many activists to finally get a voice
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:23.600]   Uh if it weren't for facebook, we may never have seen the video of george floyd being murdered
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:28.000]   That started on facebook. So no, you can absolutely make that case. I just worry
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.800]   That we are giving
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.920]   Well, we we don't have a choice that mark has been given such power
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.440]   And we don't we don't control him in any way
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:42.640]   And I do think this is the beginning of see you've read this since you've read science fiction
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:48.400]   You know that in in a hundred years corporations will run the world. That's obvious
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.120]   Very exciting in a hundred years
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:59.840]   Everything facebook is building in all all the major tech platforms. It's it's freaking brave new world
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.240]   It is the you know the dump of information that people want
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.320]   But is also controlling them like that is that it's not 1984
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.480]   Right, it's the thing where people are controlled by the things they're addicted to
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.120]   And but they keep wanting it. It's not like it's a
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:22.720]   Over it's it's actually brave new world. It's soma. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's the drug that we know is making us stupid
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.600]   But we're doing it anyway because it's it feels pretty good
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:28.240]   It's pretty good pretty good stuff
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.640]   And you know as the world gets more dystopian
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:34.160]   What do you do when the world gets more dystopian you take more soma
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:41.600]   The only the only piece of optimism i've had about this the facebook influence on the election is the
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.800]   It sounds like they're focusing
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:51.680]   I mean the war game stuff that they've reportedly been doing and in figuring out what like they're actually thinking now
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.920]   The company is apparently thinking and now about what happens if trump
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.960]   If if biden gets elected and trump
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.920]   Refuses to leave
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.640]   Yeah because of the results and facebook is trying to solve for that now
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.600]   Which I think is terrifying
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.160]   But also learning
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.080]   Even the right direction right like they're like starting to anticipate
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.200]   Saying terrible things that might happen, right?
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:28.080]   So it could be yes, they should be thinking about this although it doesn't i mean in a way this tells you how much power they have that they
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.680]   That it
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.360]   If if a president, United States loses an election and decides not to leave the white house
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:38.480]   Who do we turn to the military the secret service congress the courts no facebook
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.000]   Facebook right yeah, we don't have to kick him out of the white house
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.520]   All we do is have to cancel his twitter and facebook account and he goes away
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.160]   He's gone. He can so he can live there
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.680]   I guess this is a really a bad conversation because I don't normally like to
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:56.480]   Pick up topics where there's no answer, but lately there've been a lot of those and this is another one
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:00.560]   I don't you know i'm against for instance a federal ban on tick tock
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:06.160]   I think it's completely reasonable for the department of defense to say that can't be on your phone
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:11.280]   I think it's completely reasonable for wells farga say can't be on your phone and I think I took it off my phone after last week
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:17.280]   I think any individual could quite reasonably say i'm not gonna have tick tock on my phone. I'm not gonna have facebook on my phone
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.720]   I don't have either
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:23.200]   Uh, but that I don't think the government should step in and ban it tick tock or facebook
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:29.120]   I don't I think that that's not the right answer either or put it some on the scale of who acquires it or or get a
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:33.520]   Get some kind of a kickback from the acquisition. That's the other thing that makes no sense to me
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.000]   I mean the treasury supposed to get a the highest bidder is going to write a check to the treasury to
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.160]   You know for the permission to acquire tick tock. That's it's it's so
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:48.960]   Contrary to our american values that it's did you can't it's almost hard to know what to say
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   It's it's it's like what it's uh, honestly
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.320]   That whole situation kind of broke my heart too because i've been
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:02.800]   A fan of what microsoft has been doing for the past couple of years, especially post nadella and the way he's reshaping me too, but
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.600]   Yeah, the it I certainly
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:10.320]   Don't think much of the fact that they were able to work with the trump administration to do this
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:15.920]   So just basically take away this company or steal this company away from its own or I don't feel good about that
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   There's an old ad if you if you sleep with dogs, you'll wake up with fleas
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.120]   Uh, and this is what's really corrupting
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:31.520]   About a corrupt government is that everybody who operates within that government becomes corrupted as well because it's the only way
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.080]   You can survive
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:39.760]   And I it breaks my heart to see tim cook go to the white house and sit there grimacing
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:45.840]   Uh next to donald trump, but it's his job. He has to do it and he's going to wake up with fleas
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:49.040]   And microsoft too, and it does it it tarze
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:54.320]   Every single company in this country because they understand his power is so great
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.760]   And this is why you don't want an autocratic government. It's why authoritarian governments necessarily fail
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.440]   Why innovation doesn't work? Why the american experiment is so important because we
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:12.320]   Very intentionally from the very beginning of this country said we don't want an autocrat
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.320]   We don't want a king
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.960]   Because that corrupts the whole operation the rule of law
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.360]   Has to be paramount
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:28.480]   And i've seen in every you know one of the things I always gather from my travels as I wander around is when I I remember going to kyrow
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.560]   And you and i'm talking to people and you really get the sense that
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.280]   There's a complete loss of faith in government because they know if you can if you're a
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.520]   Family member of somebody of a minister or you can bribe them
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:49.120]   You're going to get your way otherwise you're not and that to completely demoralizes everybody
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:54.000]   Everybody just goes well screw it throws up their hand and it's you get a failed country
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.760]   And that's exactly what happened in egypt
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.320]   You get a failed country and I don't want us to go down that path that is a very bad path
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:07.680]   And uh, so yeah, yeah, you're seeing that's when you said right there with microsoft is exactly the consequence
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:11.440]   Right. I was shocked when I read microsoft's press release or blog post
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.320]   About the conversations with trump and they specifically said that they're going to make a deal
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:22.320]   That's good for the us treasury which basically means they're essentially reinforcing trunks ridiculous fact sheesh
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.200]   Yeah, it's bribery
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:31.520]   Yes, exactly. Mm-hmm. You know, I mean the deal should be based on what's good for the country perhaps
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.760]   But not what's good for the treasury
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.280]   And I think and it's kind of this is the other problems and muddies everything you can I mean you could make it's it's reasonable to have this
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:44.640]   Policy debate over should a chinese company be allowed to have a social network in the united states
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:50.560]   Or is that risky? You know, I think if if facebook were if mark succuburg were chinese
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:56.000]   There'd be a very different conversation. We would be probably actively everybody would say take down facebook
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.680]   We got I would understand that but uh, I would i'm just making the point that I think he's as bad as anybody
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.240]   And he's american
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.000]   You know, I wonder though
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.800]   The fact that tick-tock is a playground for millions and millions of young people and not just teenagers
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:16.960]   20 something voting age young people whether or not that's going to backfire on trump if he actually does
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:22.560]   Take it down or or somehow muzzle it between now and the election it seems to me people will be really angry
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.960]   If you took away their tick-tock
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   Well, and this is what breaks my heart because I see such good creativity
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.720]   And you see people like sarah cooper who is a comedian who couldn't work
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:37.920]   Because of co-phitch. There's no clubs she can perform in came up with a new way of performing
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.680]   Yes, she could have probably done it on instagram or twitter in fact, you know
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.280]   She has a presence on both
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.920]   But tick-tock was just somehow magically suited to her and she became very famous because of
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:54.080]   Tick-tock or little naz-x and old town road, which became the number one hit of 2019
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:59.520]   Thanks to tick-tock. There's a it's a place for creativity and I hate to I hate to lose that
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:05.520]   I'm sure we find an alternative, but I just that seems like a mean thing to do
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.680]   I don't know. Do you think it's gonna happen though?
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.160]   It seems so unlikely to me that it's actually gonna
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.080]   Any of the tick-tock stuff is gonna happen. Yeah
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.760]   I can't imagine there would actually be a shutdown. It seems like
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.400]   The possibility is that either microsoft or somebody will end up buying those assets, which
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.120]   Again is a wild thing and I'm sure the parent company
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:33.520]   Was it by dance? I'm sure they're gonna be out for blood. Well, they're going to sue. In fact, Larry
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.520]   You had a decent Forbes
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.520]   They announced that next week of course they've been saying this all along we're gonna sue
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:47.360]   Um, that means it now is no longer in the hands of the executive. It's in hands of the judicial branch the courts will decide
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:53.360]   Right, uh, and I guess there is a question about the legality of the executive order
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.760]   Can right can the chief executive?
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.080]   Unilaterally say yeah, we're gonna there's some evident there's some
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:07.920]   Evidence that he can ocefias the committee on foreign investment in the united states seems to have that ability they can
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.240]   Turn down mergers. They can say and we kind of did it with wahweh, right? So there's precedent for this
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:19.920]   So be very interesting what the court would say what does tick-tocks?
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.040]   Claim what are they what's their defense?
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.080]   Well, the defense is that they've been trying to negotiate with the trump administration for over a year
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.520]   And they're not getting anywhere and that they don't feel that trump is actually trying to resolve this problem
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.080]   And the other defense is that trump is interfering. I mean even as they attempt
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:44.240]   To sell themselves to a us company, you know, they're basically doing what trump asked him to do and he's still interfering
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.800]   Apparently he wants to give it to larry ellison to give it to oracle
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.880]   Yeah, that's the new one because larry ellison have a fundraiser for him
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.880]   Exactly. I mean that's just that's insane that we would make
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.480]   Such important policy decisions based on who wants to you know greece to skids for donald trump
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:05.520]   I don't think they're not the ones who need to defend themselves really because
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.800]   Nothing trump has said has been proven like these them being a chinese-owned company
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.960]   That's a security risk. They still need to prove that before they can start enacting this and the trump administration has not
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.280]   Do they need to prove it?
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.800]   I mean it does. Yeah, I guess executive orders he doesn't have to but i'm sure bite dance could come back and be like well
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.480]   We didn't do anything like you're saying we're doing these things but we're not it's kind of the same with wall way. It's
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.360]   it's yeah, uh the presumption that if uh president she of china
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.080]   Said to bite dance or wall way
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:41.920]   Uh said to bite dance. Hey, I want every bit of information
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.960]   You know bite bite dance says no no we keep all the tick tock american tick tock content in america
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.000]   We back it up at singapore never hits the chinese shores
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.120]   But we know that it's a chinese company and the chinese government can go to them
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:01.920]   By the way same as american company can go to facebook american government go to facebook and say we want to see uh all that data
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.440]   And by the way, don't don't mention anything about this. This is just between us too
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.280]   So where do we draw the line? I mean iphones are manufactured in china
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.280]   Yeah, they're they're designed in kuperkino
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.080]   But almost every piece of electronics that we have in our home comes from china
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:22.240]   And so do we do we extend this to start extending this? Yeah, well, i'm trying to think about how what's the reasonable
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:29.360]   We can look at a piece of hardware and know what it does. We can know if it's dangerous. Can't we?
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.000]   Well, you don't know what's inside your phone. You don't know what's inside the right. I know we can we can take it apart
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.400]   Look at everything. I'm taking it apart. Yeah, I can
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:41.360]   Uh the problem with wahweh as I understand it is that it's software driven in many cases
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.480]   And so you can't say with any
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:51.200]   Predictiveness out whether a piece of wahweh gear will always do because the software can be changed and we'll have some other behavior
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.880]   So you can't vet a wahweh 5g switch
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:01.680]   But you could look at a phone and vet it you could say no this phone does not have that as long as apple controls the software
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.920]   This phone will not have the ability to do anything right nefarious. I think that's the case
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.560]   Yeah, and I think that there was some concern about wahweh's
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.600]   You know the the
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:22.000]   I'm gonna sound very stupid now, which is probably accurate but like what the way that wahweh was leveraging
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.920]   Algorithms in its software for the 5g kits, right?
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.200]   Like that that's the idea right like they could they could basically change. Yeah
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.200]   Some software the software work. It's a software defined switch
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:43.360]   So the the software that you load on that switch completely defines the behavior whether it routes through china for instance
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.440]   So that's the problem
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:52.080]   You can't vet a piece of wahweh gear and say that will never misbehave because the chinese a chinese company controls it
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.400]   100%
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.880]   And so that's a reasonable thing to say yeah, we're not going to use wahweh switches now wahweh also makes phones
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:06.320]   And I don't I think you could probably say well, how is a wahweh phone worse than an apple phone? I guess because wahweh does the software
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:14.640]   Um, I don't know. I think I think that's the point is that in theory anyway hardware can be vetted
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.160]   software
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:25.600]   It can be vetted in the country where it's being right built right you can't prevent you cannot prevent a wahweh switch
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:32.800]   From loading malicious software. You just can't I also I think there is there could be arguments made for like essential core
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.440]   Pieces of hardware and technology and switches
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.400]   There's a lot of stuff happening there. There's a lot of data going through a lot of personal data
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.440]   That's different than just like a single phone tiktok
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.880]   Seeing my location which it can't by the way on the iphone
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.760]   Um, but if it could is not nearly the
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.240]   dangerous
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:06:00.640]   Thing that a guy who controls the 5g switches in the in a major american city that guy controls infrastructure that is vital
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:06.880]   Yeah, yeah, that's very different. So I I don't have a problem with a wahweh ban. I know I think it was
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.680]   capriciously
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:15.360]   implemented and hurts wahweh in ways probably shouldn't and it's gonna backfire but
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:22.720]   I think it was a reasonable thing and most by the way most western governments did decide not to use wahweh gear in their 5g switches
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:30.320]   Uh 5g networks, but I don't know about the tiktok ban. I think I don't think a government should ban a social network
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:35.120]   Well, I don't know. Well, I'll just see the government ban facebook the chinese do they ban
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.480]   The and author they do but wait, that's for the whole point. We shouldn't be like the chinese
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.080]   Tim will wrote a
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.120]   Opinion piece in the and I normally respect the guy in the new york times saying hey china does it to us
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.760]   We should do it back. No, we should stand up for a free and open internet because that's what we do
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.560]   That's how you promote our values
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.520]   You don't and the question is do you take that you take tiktok?
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.680]   It is worried that their servers are based in the u.s
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:04.720]   In singapore and not in mainland china that their policies are determined by their policy shops here in the united states
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.760]   And not in mainland china. I mean if you listen to them and i've i've spoken extensively with their executives
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.720]   They will argue that they are operating
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:20.320]   Not at the us company but certainly not with chinese domination in terms of how they make decisions about how they operate their us
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.520]   subsidiary, but they never address the issue
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:30.720]   Uh that the china that is the law of the land in china and they're a chinese company that the chinese government can
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.040]   Demand information from them which they could then take off the us servers and send to them
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.520]   They never really address that
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:42.400]   That was the most convincing sort of like theoretical example, right like you have a
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.720]   You essentially have a government official either in the us or china and somehow
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.120]   um, the chinese government takes their tiktok data
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:58.160]   And uses it against them to bend them to its will yeah, right
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:04.080]   And you can we say we say those unsaved drafts of the wap dance that you've done
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.640]   We're gonna
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:17.600]   And we know that the united states thanks to the patreon act and fyse courts and national security letters. We have similar
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:23.360]   Rules if i were chinese for instance if i was a chinese government i would i could see why they would say well
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:26.080]   We don't want any of our citizens using facebook
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:32.560]   That's not by the way the reason they they don't want the citizens using facebook because the reason they don't want
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.760]   People using facebook in china's because they might learn about the weegers
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:41.280]   Internment camps or they might learn about tenemans square or just hear about it
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:45.360]   They might think president she looks like winnie the poo and that would be the end of the world
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:50.240]   So that's the real reason and actually it may be the the only real reason to ban tiktok
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:56.560]   On my iphone tiktok doesn't get a lot of my personal information. I don't post pick videos. I just watch videos
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:01.280]   Uh the real threat of tiktok might be the propaganda threat when they think else
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.960]   Sure, actually it might be for donald trump the prop again is threat because tiktok is used by a lot of young people
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:12.240]   Who are also playing all sorts of tricks on donald trump. Yeah, we already know we already know that happened in tosa
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.920]   It helped it helped rec is how tosa rally so maybe you know when you describe how china why china doesn't want facebook
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.360]   Maybe that's why donald trump doesn't want tiktok. Well, i'm sure it is
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.080]   Actually come to think of it
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:28.000]   And uh leo i'm glad you brought up the the china and the weeger muslim like
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:33.040]   Situation that whole deal. I feel like that's something we should be pressing american companies on harder
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   When they decide to collaborate with the chinese government and work in china and offer their products in china too
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:44.880]   That to me seems like a more useful way of us questioning a lot of this of what's happening in china
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.600]   Well, and that's another
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.600]   issue with facebook as well
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.320]   Yeah, facebook has consistently benefited
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:56.400]   Dictators in number and me and mar and other countries
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.120]   uh
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:05.680]   Here's a journal. I'm sorry washington post article from 2018 why dictators love facebook
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.480]   uh, and and this is
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.320]   You know
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.440]   This is the problem with facebook and any social network they they can weaponize information in
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.920]   Ways that we have never seen before
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.240]   You know somebody asked me well, isn't this how is this any different from william randal first
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.880]   creating the spanish american war
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.560]   uh
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.760]   In what it was at 19 8 19 15
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:35.120]   Uh, and he did you know he lobbied for war he actually made the war happen
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.440]   Um, and so in a way, this is like that except he's even more powerful
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.480]   Yeah, and everything happens very quickly like one post can can be a war declaration
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.960]   It wouldn't just be several articles or a big push
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:52.480]   Um leo when we started talking about this you said you didn't you didn't want to leave this in a place where we didn't know
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.720]   We don't have any answers. We kind of don't know what to say
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:00.640]   I do I think we can start to think about what we want from our social networks moving forward facebook
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:07.200]   Did announce an oversight board which unfortunately will not actually be up and running the lack through the election
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.720]   Thanks a lot guys
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:14.320]   Um, but there is certainly more we can start pushing for these companies like I wish facebook was run more like
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:21.360]   Maybe like an actual newspaper or even like you know with people who are who are used to dealing with facts and information
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.600]   Frickin librarians like facebook needs to be someplace. It's actually
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.320]   Managed by people who understand the importance of information the flow of accurate information
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:37.600]   And I should I should point out historians do not agree that the the press war between houston paulitzer
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.480]   In the 1890s created the spanish-american war
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:46.720]   uh, the remember certainly remember the main and and that slogan created a lot of war
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.800]   hysteria, but
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:56.320]   Joseph Campbell professor of communication american university the great joseph Campbell said no serious historian of the spanish-american war
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.880]   Period embraces the notion that they foam at it or brought on the war in 1890
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.000]   But at least william randoff got us her castle. I mean I
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.760]   Wail you go to hoy and see the zuckerberg
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:17.680]   Plantation and kawai can approach that you can't get anywhere near I imagine it rivals her castle and its size and
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.400]   and opulence
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.360]   Park someday. Yeah, it's a lot more like a zanadu if you ask me
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:29.840]   But that is the big difference right like larry when you were talking about the the sort of your filter bubble being
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.160]   um, the women's march and black lives matter and some of this stuff and then
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.640]   The filter bubbles that we're talking about when it comes to q and on and and you know
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:46.960]   Vaccine hesitant groups or vaccine resistant groups and and this stuff to me the real difference there and in what divindra is talking about too
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.000]   like the real difference there is facts, right? Right like right the
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.240]   You know you can you can be whatever you can argue politics all you want but there is not a
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.960]   An elite conspiracy to steal and eat babies that is run out of a pizza shop
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:10.240]   That is a fact. Okay, like that's not you don't we don't need to argue about that
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.080]   That's be it. I believe that we're true
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:16.320]   I would be is that I would be up an arm if I honestly believe the democrats were eating babies
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.360]   I would be up an arms, but it happens to not be true
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.800]   Right and so like there's the difference I think in terms of what we ask our social networks for right
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.520]   We don't ask them to stop allowing people to
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.800]   to
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:36.240]   Advocate for the things that they believe in necessarily but if put if the thing is clearly a complete
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:44.720]   Pipe dream well something we're obvious down on right but here's a study from a vase, which is a non-profit public interest group
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:51.520]   Facebook is funneling readers towards covid misinformation and this is killing people
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:59.760]   Uh false medical information can be deadly researchers led by bang ladesha's international center for diarrheal disease research
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.440]   There's a place I never want to work at but uh, thank god somebody
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:10.560]   Thanks somebody god somebody does writing in the american journal of tropical medicine and hygiene have suggested a single piece of coronavirus
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.840]   information led to as many as 800 deaths deaths
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.360]   uh
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.200]   Facebook
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.880]   apparently
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   Because of the algorithm i'm guessing
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:29.040]   Over promotes misinformation and under promotes truthful information
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:35.680]   So um, you know and i'm sure they i'm sure they don't want it to be that way
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.400]   as the algorithm out of control
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.560]   And they even claim that they don't do that they actually are blocking
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.600]   Uh dangerous information at the same time saying we don't want to be an arbiter of truth
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.920]   So they're giving us mixed messages as to what their goal really is around this dangerous information
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.560]   A vase analyzes 200 pieces of health misinformation shared on facebook
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.880]   After being identified as problematic fewer than one in five had facebook's warning label
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:08.320]   84 slip through controls after they were translated into other languages or
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.720]   Republished and whole iron parts so facebook does have controls they don't work
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:18.800]   They don't work and uh, it's a big problem post the rate is boring
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.520]   Pardon me. Yeah, the truth is boring. The truth is boring a lot of the time
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.960]   Unfortunately, not lately but the truth is but you know a lot of the time the truth is boring and facebook doesn't
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.200]   That doesn't make facebook any money. That doesn't keep people on facebook, right?
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.280]   A vase identified 42 super spreader sites
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.080]   That had 28 million followers
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:46.720]   Generating an estimated 800 million views all of them have false information a single article
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:53.040]   Which claimed falsely that the a ma was encouraging doctors and hospitals to overestimate deaths
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.160]   In fact, i've seen that on the news
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.040]   Yep, fox picked up on that one. Yep, not true
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.120]   It was seen 160 million times on facebook it becomes true
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.240]   Because the news picks it up and you see it and nobody really thinks about the source
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:12.640]   It goes from facebook to fox to trump and then back out again. Yeah
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.760]   Global networks those super spreader networks
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:19.280]   Had 3.8 billion views last year
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.480]   The audience peaked in april
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.600]   With 460 million views in a single month
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:31.840]   I think that's because we're all desperate looking for information anywhere. We can find it and problem is facebook is not effective and
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.440]   in
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   blocking misinformation
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.920]   So, I know it's scary. I have I have a friend who's actually a fairly famous
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.560]   Person. I won't even mention her name
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.760]   Who's a trump supporter and I've known her for years and years and years and I went to her page yesterday and there she was
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:56.400]   Standing at some conservative event that trump spoke at holding arm you know arm to arm with her fellow conservative women
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.600]   Without a mask without any social distancing
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.080]   And I don't notice she really believed that that's the safe thing to do. She's not a stupid person
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:09.760]   She's not a bad person, but she's publicly demonstrating this incredibly irresponsible behavior
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:16.000]   I guess based on the you know what her worldview is and it it makes no sense to me. I mean the world I live in
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.560]   People would never do that
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.040]   It's a strange
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:24.480]   World we live in in 2020. There's no question about it
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.280]   All right, that's this is depressing
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.560]   Just divindra come on. What's the answer? You said there was an answer. What's the answer?
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.760]   I do think the answer is we we have to push these companies to
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.880]   I think the past couple years facts truth that we have let it erode so much so
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:48.000]   It would be nice for us to push for that more from facebook and I think that's it and every social network twitter everything
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.440]   They're starting to do that and I think it's great the oversight board sounds good
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:56.080]   But we need more people and we need that to be the thing that the algorithm is tuned for
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:05.840]   And not the most like yeah, you know fun sexy misinformation or viral posts like virality is the danger really and that's what we've built towards for the past
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.360]   Several years. I also think that we don't have very good defenses against chaotic evil
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.440]   Nope, and uh and we as human beings assume the best
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.040]   And we don't understand chaotic evil and when it exists it can
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.960]   ride
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.520]   Over us like the four horsemen of the apocalypse because we have no defenses. It's like
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:34.320]   It's like you're not following the rules. Well, they're like whatever man. Whatever man. There are no rules man
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.880]   Where we're going we don't need
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.120]   All right, let's take a little break
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.800]   executive producer for podcast wb r you are

[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.480]   I spent okay long gonna take a break hold hold that thought I got to take a break
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.920]   Hold that thought because I want somebody to say because I already bought one
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   And I want somebody to reaffirm I need a little confirmation bias if you don't mind
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:53.440]   Or should I brought to you by mint mobile? I tell you I got the best phone I ever got best deal
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:56.400]   I ever got when I got my iphone se from mint mobile
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:01.040]   What a deal that was mint mobile is that gives you the same premium network coverage
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:06.480]   That you would get from t mobile because it is t mobile writing on the t mobile network
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.800]   but for a lot less
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.760]   I you know, I'm when I I pay like $90 a month per line for my t mobile
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:18.160]   my mint mobile 25 bucks a month because I got the I got the
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:20.560]   12 gigabyte a month unlimited
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:25.200]   nationwide talk and text plan the biggest plan they have is 300 bucks for a year
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:32.160]   25 bucks a month you can go down to the 15 dollars a month with their three-month introductory plan. That's amazing
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.320]   unlimited text
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   unlimited talk
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:40.800]   High quality all plans include this is new 5g for free what?
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:45.040]   Go ask go ask Verizon how much that will cost
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.240]   It's unbelievable. I don't know why people pay more and so when I got the iphone se
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.680]   I got a deal they offer you can either buy phones or take your existing phones when I get the se
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:59.680]   $15 a month for the se $15 a month for the service that's $30 a month for 24 months
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.920]   $30 a month
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.120]   For one third what I'm paying t mobile. I got a phone and the service
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:11.840]   Oh my god by going online eliminating the cost of a retail store mint mobile can save you a lot of money
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.000]   And I think ryan Reynolds is putting a little cash in there too
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.560]   every plan with mint mobile is
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.440]   Is
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:23.200]   Gives you unlimited nationwide talk and text and then you choose how much data you're going to use
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.520]   So I went all the way I got the 12 gigabyte plan, but there are plans for every use
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:32.800]   Every budget if you're not 100 percent satisfied. They've got a seven day money back guarantee
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:37.040]   There's no risk. They will send you the sim for free if you're going to use your existing phone
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:41.760]   You could port your number over either with the existing phone or buying a new phone
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.680]   So you save your number you save your contacts
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.840]   There couldn't be a better way to switch to the fox the fox looks surprisingly like
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:53.200]   Ryan Reynolds by the way, I don't want to say anything. He's got he's got right still ryan's glasses

[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.880]   This is uh an android phone
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:38.240]   We talked about a couple of weeks ago when m microsoft announced it panels pannas videos now available
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:42.320]   You can watch it on youtube but the originally journalist you probably went to that right?
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:48.720]   Yeah, yeah, that's a private briefing before yeah, yeah, I don't understand why they did that and then the next day released it publicly
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.600]   it's like
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.600]   You gotta prep those stories
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:23:00.080]   It does take a while to write these things into kind of distill this information into something so you're not just watching a microsoft ad
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.760]   I vastly prefer this rather than them than just I agree
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:10.240]   For us. I agree. This is one thing covid has brought us that I hope will continue which is no more conferences
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:14.000]   I even thought that democratic convention was much more enjoyable
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.440]   The apple announced better the apple the apple ww to see was better
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:27.760]   Uh much better. Yeah, um I state the state by state thing in the den wasn't that awesome?
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:32.240]   It was the most ridiculous awkward best you hated that
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:37.600]   I thought it was amazing. I thought it was amazing. So when I was a kid on our industry
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.040]   Yeah, I know i'm worried got a big plug when I was a kid
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:45.200]   I was I still am obviously if you you know if you watch our shows i'm a political junkie
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:50.400]   I love this stuff. I eat it up when I was a kid I would get a pan of paper and I would write down the votes
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.880]   This was back when a convention was often contested hum free is pulling a whole no
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.480]   They and you'd watch them confabbing and you know in the smoke field rooms and trying to the next vote
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.280]   He got it on 10 more votes and I loved that stuff
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:09.680]   I really the state by state vote was so much fun because this time instead of staring down a dan rather with a backpack
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.400]   And uh talking in the in the convention
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:17.280]   Uh floor you got to see every state in a little something of every state and they went from one away
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:21.200]   I thought it went surprising. Well, there was a great. Oh no, I've got to find this
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:25.760]   There was a great facebook post of the producer
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.560]   Uh of the oh, I don't know
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.840]   Right. Oh the guy. Yeah. Yeah, the guy who did it. Yeah
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.720]   Yeah, we're not wearing shoes and socks sitting in shorts in his in his house
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.760]   Right in his living room. Look like yeah, set up
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.680]   Yeah, it was there. Here's the picture is uh
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:49.360]   Yeah, Emmy award winning director. I think right? Yeah, he's got three Emmys on the shelf right there
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.640]   Uh, he did it barefoot from his living room
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:58.000]   And I love his it looks a little bit like the twit studios. He's got big screens with 16
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.640]   screens on on each of them
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:06.480]   He's this is multitasking. Yeah. Now. He's not he's not directing what's in front of him is a comms switch
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.920]   So he's talking to the various sources and saying get ready. We're gonna go to you blah blah blah
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:17.760]   Uh, it's kind of this is another covid winner. Right? Right. Yeah
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.400]   Card tables don't know a card table in shorts without shoes on
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.840]   14 Emmy awards six director guilds of america awards as director and producer
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:31.920]   Uh, nice job glenn wise
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.600]   You know
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:42.240]   I've covered conventions and what you see on the floor of the convention is totally different than what you typically see on television
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.200]   Except this year when it was only on television
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.280]   And so we actually all got we saw the same. Yeah, that's right
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.040]   um, so
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.200]   Back to the duo
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.520]   Was do over
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.520]   Um, this is it so I was all excited. I thought well, not excited
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:07.600]   But I was going to buy the flip the new samsung galaxy z flip to just because I feel like folding phones or something
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.000]   There are no z fold to z fold whatever now the flip swan is the other way. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.080]   conflating everything
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.320]   Um, but I think folding screens. I don't know if they're ready yet vindry. You've had them right
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.880]   Yeah, well, I've I've played around with some I haven't reviewed any of the folding phones
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:30.320]   But I've definitely touched them and you know use them for a little bit and actually last year when microsoft first announced the surface duo and the neo
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.400]   Which is going to be the you know the windows?
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.120]   Uh snapdragon, you know powered one
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:41.520]   I I was just more sold on this idea of two separate hinges or two separate screens with a hinge
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:48.320]   Yes with a hinge because this is dirt like that is far more durable than trying to fold a single screen
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.680]   You know over and over and over you could flip it around use just one screen
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.000]   You can use both screens you'll have to deal with the hinge
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.960]   You'll always have something down the middle of the screen. That's unfortunate
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.720]   But I think in terms of mobile multi- I'd rather have that than a crease
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.560]   Yes
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:08.000]   And microsoft says something kind of interesting which sounds on the face of it just making lemon at a lemonade out of a lemon
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.360]   But I think it actually is sort of true. They said there's penthouse penne
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:16.720]   You know how he is there's something so sexy and magical about the having that guy talks, man
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.120]   What's like an hour long walk through microsoft with him
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.080]   um just like briefing on something and
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:29.920]   He is just so into it. He's so into all the microsoft stuff and you gotta love it. He's so he's like wow
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.640]   He's a true believer. Yeah, so
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.600]   he says
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.880]   And you know what I think there's some merit in it even though it's a little self-serving that there's some sort of context switching
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.000]   That that that having the bezel and two separate screens has had one unfolded big screen
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.520]   Somehow is more productive and it is true that one screen can have one app another screen and another app
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.320]   They've created software that watches for this
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.880]   And even if the apps are not dual screen aware even though that's built into and right now
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.040]   The the phone will be smart enough to say well that's gonna be in that one. That's gonna be in that one
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:08.000]   I think I can't wait to get my hands on one because I think it it's been
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.480]   Since 2007 that we've seen a new phone for factor that that worked
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:21.440]   Yeah, yeah, I I am excited and I'll say I felt a little I felt a little afraid to say I have been excited for this because everyone's just
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.320]   You and me everybody's so critical of it. Oh, it's too expensive. No NFC
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:31.600]   It does the wireless charging. Where's the wireless charge? It's not waterproof water. Why is water?
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.640]   What did when did that become the most important factor in a phone?
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.600]   Were you guys dropping it into the toilets? What are you doing?
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:41.920]   I do see that in every device just because things happened my wife once left one of her phones
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:46.800]   I think it was the original pixel out in the rain like we didn't know it was on the deck and get the next day
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:49.120]   You know, so don't leave your phone in the rain
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:54.160]   Don't leave your phone with the rain, but water spills things happen and these things are getting worse and that's okay
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.520]   Yeah, I'm excited about it and even despite the price sure it's 1400 bucks to start
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:06.240]   But man our high-end phones have gotten to that point the iPhone 11 pro the note like it's not over
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:10.640]   $2,000. It's not $2,500, which is what the galaxy fold launched at
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.600]   We don't know what the new fold will be but it's definitely a bit more than 1500 bucks
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.440]   Yeah, and this is basically slightly more than the galaxy z flip
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.880]   Which is the slightly smaller folding one that folds into like the little square
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:27.760]   I am not too fond of that phone. So you know, this seems more in line with things
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:33.280]   But yeah, we it's launching September 10th the surface duo is so hopefully we'll be getting review
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:37.600]   Let's see and I I really want to play with it because it just seems so exciting
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.440]   This is kind of I want to do more I always want to do more when I'm on mobile
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:44.720]   And this is kind of the thing we've been waiting for for so long
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.280]   That's it's funny because
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:52.960]   The palm that is that's my favorite. Oh shut up. You could tell I haven't I can out of the box yet
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.520]   Is that is that a new poem?
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:01.520]   No, no, does it exist anymore? Yeah, they just shipped a new one. Oh god. Well, I haven't even unwrapped the old one so
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:08.000]   Somebody it's not palm itself. Somebody else is making a palm somebody else made a palm phone
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.080]   But if you go to palm.com
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:17.600]   You can get a I don't know what this is. It looks like a phone. It's a phone. That's that's why I'm bored. I don't want another glass slab
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:25.040]   I do you guys remember snap bracelets. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the technology. I am waiting
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.360]   I
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.480]   Want that kind of situation where I can just be like
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:34.800]   And it's like nothing you want to find that you wear on your wrist
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:39.680]   You open it up and it's there and then you go snap and it goes back in your wrists. Is that what you want?
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.520]   Yes, well, maybe not on your wrist
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:45.680]   I don't know or maybe just something that like I want something as flexible as that
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.600]   You know what I mean?
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:54.320]   That like I could like sit up on a wall or I can just like make it. Oh, I agree with you hard and then I agree make it roll up and like
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:31:01.600]   Anyway, I get there eventually and here is my very own. I'm freeze McGee
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:08.160]   Snaps he wouldn't wouldn't that be cool. So imagine if that was a phone and imagine hanging up
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.160]   It would be so satisfying Ben Brock Johnson. You're a knitwit
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:18.800]   And then I just you hang up it's a bracelet
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:28.640]   Thank you, john, so jamby ran out of here to get his freeze McGee death by stereo
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:33.760]   Snap bracelet there see I needed to practice before I could really get it
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:40.400]   So, um, okay good divinric because I read so many negative reviews after I bait I got up at 6am
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:45.840]   I said it's available and I ordered it and then and then I felt kind of bad like everybody said you're an idiot
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:51.040]   What'd you buy that for? That's a terrible phone. I you know, we don't know how well it's gonna be
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:56.720]   But I think like based on what we know so far the folding phones have so many issues. I don't trust them
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:02.160]   I would much more trust this thing. Yeah separate screens. It's not a technology. It's technology
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.880]   We understand it's OLED screens. Yeah, it's a hinge. Yeah
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.520]   In the hinge separate screens a hinge
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:12.240]   And the hinge shoes like I feel like it's an undersung hero of the last decade
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:19.920]   But Microsoft has spent so much time and energy perfecting gets hinge technology with the surface and kind of everybody has had to start doing that now too
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:23.120]   So that's been the thing powering all the convertible PCs
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:27.280]   All the folding devices for the past, you know, all the laptops for the past couple years too
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:32.560]   So, uh, I don't know the the kind of like geek in me just loves seeing hinge tech get to such a weird
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.840]   intricate point to well even Samsung spent time
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.960]   On the elaborate hinge that they learned from a dice and vacuum cleaner
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.560]   The hinge cleaner that's the hinge cleaner
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:52.480]   Roller inside against the dust out when they said that that's when I decided I thought I'm not buying that phone that's stupid
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:33:00.160]   So I don't have a hinge phone. I or any kind of folding phone. So I remain unhinged. Oh very good. You're unhinged
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:05.040]   I'm unhinged but someday I just I just want phones to be exciting again
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:07.840]   And uh, I agree, you know, I you know
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:13.120]   I'm constantly getting these in for review and you know, I I got the pixel for a which is nice and by the way
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:19.280]   My wife had dropped it in the toilet and it didn't break that's good. Nice, but you know, nothing exciting about it. It just it works
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:24.240]   350 bucks. That's super. Yeah, we're like the you know, the phone you talk about the iPhone sc
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:28.080]   These are you know, you can now get a good phone. That's a great phone. You're $4. Yeah
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:34.880]   It's all the same guts as the uh current iPhone 11. It's not, you know, it's a good phone. It's just smaller
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.320]   Yeah, which in some ways is good. Yeah
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:41.760]   Uh, it's you know, I never really
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.680]   Uh
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:47.680]   Used to be because I was the tech guy and the gadget guy back in the early days
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:53.520]   Uh, people would always ask me about phones. This is when they were like, you know, the no key of flip phone. It's like
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.000]   I don't do phones man
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:56.800]   And then
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:01.440]   And then not cool. Not cool man. I don't talk about phones. That's I talk about computers man
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.000]   And then the iPhone yeah, exactly there it is
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.480]   It's one of my newer ones
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.280]   Well, I read what is with you and old phones. He's got one of those old giant battery
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:15.520]   Things in the the microphone flips that goes with that typewriter behind you
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.840]   I think I showed you this one here the camera on this is really hard to block. Yeah
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:25.040]   No, I don't get it. He had a dial. I asked my yeah, look at that
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:29.040]   So isn't it funny how these tropes from devices that
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:34.880]   Anybody under 25 has never seen before like dial the phone and I asked my daughter
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.160]   She's 20. I said you lose it do people in your generation
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.040]   do this do the call me thing because
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:45.360]   Their phones have never had an earpiece and a microphone piece
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:52.400]   She said nobody does that it's old people do that. You know, it's call me. Yeah, call me. Yeah, put a flat
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:59.520]   Put a flat. It's not the hang loose. Nobody does that anymore. That's also very few people are actually holding the phones up to
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:02.640]   them. Yeah, it's all well that was the other thing video video. Yeah
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:05.920]   What is that all about? That's the most annoying thing in the world
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.720]   You put the person on speaker and then you hold the phone to your mouth and you talk like that in the whole world
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:14.480]   Here's every bit of your conversation. That was basically
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:21.040]   That's the thing I've seen the older generation do once they got to these phones. Oh, it's old folks. Okay
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.760]   It's easier to hear dad
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.400]   And it's easier to hear and I and actually it disappoints me
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.400]   I mean, it's ridiculous that he does it all the time and there are people who I'm always like
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.720]   Do they know that they're on speakerphone right now?
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.640]   Like they can hear you know what I mean?
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.600]   And I'm like
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:42.320]   I I guess most of them probably know but I but that is like a huge failure. I feel like of
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:48.240]   Modern tech companies in in terms of dealing with folks who want a smartphone but
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:56.960]   Can't hear it through the tiny little I also think nobody wants to press the square glass against their cheese flat. Yeah, that is not a comfortable
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:02.160]   If I have to talk on the phone like this for any length of time, I'm very unhappy. Yeah
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:08.800]   So partially probably part of the rise of like wireless earbuds and everything too like it is the easier way
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:14.400]   I've always had headphones plugged in like I can't remember the last time I've had a long conversation with my phone held up
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.000]   You know normally and how about wired is that gone? Is that dead?
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.800]   Wired I think for most people wired headphones. Yeah for most people probably
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.640]   So that's when I saw the duo one of the things that microsoft showed and I was kind of surprised
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.240]   Is a woman clicking a phone first of all they keep saying it's not a phone
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.720]   But one of the big things was this woman holding it to her face and it's big
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:40.960]   It looks like a piece of lumber wide so wide. Yeah, and I thought no one is going to use it that way
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.040]   They're all going to have earbuds in
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:46.160]   And you know what it's going to look great because it's going to look like a little laptop
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.760]   It's going to have be slightly open and you'll have the keyboard there
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:55.200]   You might have the person's face on one screen and an app on another. It's going to be a very nice phone
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.960]   I think covid 19 has been a great advertising for apple air pods almost everybody you see
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.520]   Everybody on CNN on msnbc
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:09.760]   They're all where except for the fox people they've all got phones with dials hold on to their head
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:13.280]   Probably they're probably using using the one i am going to fan up on
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.680]   I should be on fox
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:21.600]   Actually
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.600]   The the truth is old people
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.640]   What you do is you pair your phone to your hearing aids
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.960]   And that's oh
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.880]   It works great. I've the first time every sign but you do it. I saw steve martin
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.840]   Talking like this to his phone
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:39.840]   I'm saying steve you if you put it to your ear you could hear it. He said no
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.600]   No, no, it's I hear it my hearing aids
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.080]   And his phone is like down at his waist and he's talking to it. I said, oh, that's cool
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.600]   I actually bought hearing aids just so I can do it
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.840]   Well, I mean, that's when all the earbud stuff is moving towards that's what they're going
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.440]   New samsung galaxy buds like yeah, that's what we it is what we want
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.760]   It is both great and kind of terrifying
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:03.360]   It's very much that black mirror episode where everybody just has earbuds on all the time and can't actually hear each other
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.200]   We're all walking around
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.120]   I just wish my pixel buds wouldn't keep popping out of my ear. I yet to figure out
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.040]   Do you have the new ones because every new ones they pop out everybody's hating the new ones
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.400]   Do they drop out on you?
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.200]   Yeah, they drop out on the ground as i'm walking and then I have to worry about you know
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.120]   Do they get covid when they hit the ground so
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.040]   Apparently, I don't know if you get covid through your ear. Yeah, huh?
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:27.760]   That's interesting. This is why the necklace earbuds were always better and
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:33.280]   We should stick with those like or at least keep those around you know annoying to have something around your neck
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.600]   I like so the thing I especially when I started reviewing where else here
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.880]   But it's where do you put them when you need to talk to somebody? Do you have to carry the case around?
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:45.680]   In your front pocket
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:52.400]   Any data on how many people have lost you early? Well, I have data on me. I've lost three sets of earpods
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:39:00.960]   Before I stopped. Yeah before I stopped by half of three sets. You can't buy. I didn't know this apple sells individual hairpods. Yes
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:08.080]   Did they do did they do the research on that and figure out how much money they were gonna make?
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.400]   No kidding
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.240]   Probably probably part of it and here's the thing like wearing something around your neck isn't great
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.120]   But when I was wearing those I would they never fall on the floor
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.960]   I put them down around like the beat sex, which is the other the undersung and unloved apple
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:27.600]   You know earbuds uh hang those around and nothing happens to them. They're perfectly fine
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:34.320]   I do I like these I got them on amazon scott wilkinson recommended them from a company called one more
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.920]   And they have actually this may not be the ones but they have a they have a necklace
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:42.640]   They have a little and the microphones in the necklace
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.160]   Which is really great. Yeah, these aren't them. Let me see if I can find them the microphones in the necklace
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.480]   So the microphones closer to your mouth
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:55.840]   It just makes sense, but it just it feels kind of it looks like i'm wearing a weird collar. It feels
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.200]   Sure. It's a it's a it's a these these right here
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.600]   So she's wearing them and they go around your neck like you got a little dog collar
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.040]   I don't like the collars, but the beat sex there there are a whole bunch like the ones actually to the left of what you were looking at
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:15.680]   The ones without the collar with just like a clean wire all the way around. Oh, so it like the original pixel buds where they're attached
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:19.200]   Yeah, oh then when you let go they just hang around your neck
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.000]   Okay
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.040]   And then of course you can get one of these guys which would allow you to plug in a regular old-fashioned headphone
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:30.160]   No, if that's what you want to do
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.280]   No, no
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:36.640]   We actually with the removal of the headphone jack apple has really created a problem. I think
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:43.520]   I don't know what the good solution is. I do wear those astraschox. They were an advertising for a while
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:47.200]   They're over a year. They don't go in your ear because they're bone conductance
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:52.240]   And so you can wear them all the time and then you just you hear things and everything's normal
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:55.440]   But you can also hear a phone call our music or voice
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:01.360]   I wonder if that's leave can tell fun you you're not allowed to wear earphones when you're driving
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:04.720]   But see these aren't in your ear. So I don't I think they would be legal. Yeah, yeah
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:12.400]   They're they're specifically for runners. Basically, there's anybody who I wear them because then my wife could talk to me while i'm listening to something
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:17.520]   They're not great for music, but they're fine for voice and they're actually really good for phone calls
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.680]   I don't know. I just I feel like
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:26.400]   We took away the headphone jack without a really good replacement. I don't know what don't worry the apple ear implants are coming
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.800]   So that's what we need baby. Like it right in
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:31.200]   John we have a promo right
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:36.640]   We have a promo let's take a break and watch a little video that we made of some of the fun things that happened this week
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:41.120]   Previously on twit a stunning star wars shirt. I might add
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:46.560]   Uh rebel alliance symbols. It's got all three and air when transports. It doesn't pick sides
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:52.240]   Only a sith believes in absolute. Yes. This is my permanent star wars. So I think I got
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:03.440]   Tech news weekly. I just got the samson galaxy note 20 ultra that is a mouthful and is also a handful. Yeah
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:10.720]   You got it windows weekly so clear at this point that trump is completely puppet mastering
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:16.000]   This tech talk right because now you've got oracle in the mix
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.120]   It will slot in right between their database products and what the hell does this company even make?
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.840]   Java mac break weekly
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:29.840]   I think both apple and epic forget in this that they are responsible for a huge dependency for any other system
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:33.600]   Yeah, and if either apple or epic does anything to jeopardize the unreal engine
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:38.560]   It's not just them who suffer hands on android today. I want to talk you through
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.960]   sideloading of apps
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:47.760]   There are times when you might want an app outside of the play store take fortnight for example. Oh twit
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.400]   some assembly required
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:54.480]   Fortnite. Hey, I hear that's a pretty good game. I'm gonna try that
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:58.480]   Thank you

[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.360]   service
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.040]   It's vishing
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:09.120]   Vishing is the new threat vishing
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:13.280]   Watch out the fbi and sissa the cyber security and
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:21.520]   Infrastructure security agency who i've never heard from before but apparently they exist on thursday issue to join alert
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:28.160]   To warn about vishing attacks you've heard of fishing with a ph you heard a spear fishing
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.520]   Now vishing with a v it's voice
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.800]   Fishing and we're seeing more and more of this in particular with work at home
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:40.640]   As a way to get vpn credentials
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:47.360]   Of course once you got the vpn and the credentials you can log into the company network and it's yours, baby. It's all yours
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.080]   Um, what they're doing is they're setting up
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:56.560]   Fishing sites traditional fishing sites that have the target companies named dash
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:02.400]   Service or support or dad ticket like twit dash service dot com
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.520]   And then they do social engineering they actually make voice calls
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:12.240]   Especially new hires at the targeted company and they say things like
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:17.680]   Uh, yeah, we were I know you're on our vpn platform right now. We're about to move platforms
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.760]   We want to of course bring your account over so this is seamless for you
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.920]   So I need uh your login and I need your password
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:31.040]   So we can move you over and apparently it's very effective
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.680]   Uh, they're using unattributed voiceover ip address phone numbers
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:38.800]   They call employees on their personal cell phone
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.720]   Um
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:47.360]   And then once they once they succeed they can expand the tech to incorporate spoofed numbers of other offices and employees
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:50.880]   So it looks like it's coming from dan and accounting
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.680]   Um, they they will pose as uh the it help desk
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:02.960]   Um, they'll use what they already know about the employees personally identifiable information name position duration a company
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:07.440]   Hey, uh, this is uh, this is joe right you just joined you've been here at six weeks, right?
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.720]   Um, I think you're working from home is your are you living still living on klaxford street?
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:20.080]   Yeah, so we've moved the vpn. We need your account login. Okay. And by the way, I'm getting um, the
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:25.920]   The uh, two factor is it is the digit are you getting the six digits six four three nine one one?
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:32.000]   You're not what are you getting? Oh, i'm sorry. All right, I better reset that. Okay. Well, thanks dan
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.800]   We're got you set up. You'll be on the new vpn soon. Thank you and of course you'd be very good at this
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.800]   i'm good at it, aren't i?
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:41.440]   You're good
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.440]   Right, that's believable
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:49.840]   Yeah, uh, they get through the two factor they get through and uh, I mean this is awesome
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:52.320]   It's very effective and apparently
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:56.560]   It's becoming a big problem and of course once they're in they can put ransomware on the network
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.720]   They can they can put rats on the network. They can keep an eye on everything going on brian crabs has a good article on this
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:08.800]   I mentioned it probably because it's a good idea for you who listen to our show you're too smart to fall for this
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:13.360]   But maybe it's time to mention this to your company or your uh co-workers
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:20.000]   Be suspicious of unsolicited phone calls or email messages or texts or even visits
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.560]   Sometimes they come to your door
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.120]   Uh, and and whatever you do
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:30.080]   Do not give them the walk into your vpn
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:33.840]   Yep
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:37.200]   It's also a problem because people post stuff on social networking
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:41.520]   Kind of blithely and that's you know a great resource
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:47.040]   Um, so there was our that's our security warning for the week vishing
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:53.840]   I wish you do not have yeah, what is it? It's uh, I don't know what the accent is but it's
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.640]   I wish to suck your blood
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.600]   I wish yeah, you see I come to vish you
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:06.640]   Bd Bd Bd Bg Bishing. Yeah, that's right. That's a Caesar. I think it was Caesar said that. Yeah, I came I saw
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:09.440]   Bish
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:12.960]   Uh, I'm a little
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.080]   As long as I'm on crabs on security. I'm a little miffed about this when we talked a little bit about on security now
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.040]   as well. Microsoft has known about a zero day
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.000]   for two years
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.360]   Poop-poot it for two years
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:33.760]   Even though it was being exploited they only fixed it on august 11th on their patch tuesday
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.200]   It was one of the record number
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:40.000]   120 security holes fixed
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.640]   last tuesday
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:45.360]   And this is a bad vulnerability
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.480]   Which was discovered a long time ago
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:50.640]   Um
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.160]   And I think I know why it happened. I think I finally figured out why it happened
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:51:01.680]   So the way you would exploit this is you would take an msi file. Those are the installer files microsoft uses on windows
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:04.480]   And those are authenticated
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.080]   Uh, they use authenticate as on code certificates
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:15.840]   To validate it so it won't run if if the certificate doesn't match but microsoft left a little loophole in that
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:21.120]   And I think it's for localization. So you've got the installer file
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:27.040]   It's all written in english, but maybe you uh want to make it available in china as well or japan
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:31.920]   So you there's a capability to add at the end of a file
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:35.440]   the localization strings for different languages
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:39.120]   And that's always been part of msi. Here's the problem
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:44.240]   You're now modifying it. You'd have to get a new certificate. So microsoft said no, no, no
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:50.080]   We'll do the authentic code on the main thing. We'll assume that the side car with localization strings that's harmless
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.320]   We'll just we won't bother including that
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:54.800]   in the certificate
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:52:00.640]   Well, it didn't take long before people realized two things first of all you could put anything at the end of one of these msi files
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:06.880]   And microsoft wouldn't need to say yeah, it's fine. It's not modified in any way. We think it's significant
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:12.560]   But then the second big realization was it turns out java. I didn't know this but java
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:20.400]   Looks at jar files starts at the back because that's where the symbols are and then looks for the the code to jump to main
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:24.400]   It looks at the back. It doesn't start at the front most programs run from the front to the back
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.560]   It runs from the back to the front
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:30.720]   So some wise guy a couple of years ago said oh look if we do a simple copy
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:37.600]   Literally a copy you copy an msi file to a jar file a malicious java file
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.760]   It'll join them two together
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:41.760]   The authentic code signature will still work
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.400]   Somebody who runs that file
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:49.520]   Will think they're running a microsoft installer file in fact they're running a jar file
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:52.480]   And java will jump in and execute the end
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:56.240]   And you're in
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:59.920]   This literally was discovered two years ago
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:07.760]   By a bernardo quintero from virus total he's the manager over there. It's a google service that scans
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:11.760]   Submitted files. He wrote a blog post January 15th 2019
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:14.960]   Explaining how it works
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:18.160]   According to quintero
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.320]   Microsoft security team said yeah, that's right
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:24.080]   But that's intended behaviors, so we're not going to address it
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:29.200]   Almost sounds like it was a backdoor meant for somebody
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:34.000]   Well, that's the other the other theories. Maybe the nsa said yeah, it'd be nice if you left that
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:39.200]   Yeah, we really need it because you know you couldn't you could easily fix this
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:41.760]   You just say no no you can't
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:44.800]   You can't just add anything arbitrarily to the back of an msi file
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:47.360]   And they have fixed it
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:51.040]   Apparently they fixed it because it was being used
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:54.720]   regularly
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:56.720]   by bad guys
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:58.720]   uh
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:04.160]   Not great bob not great Bob great. No Bob reminds me of uh
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:09.040]   I don't know if this is the same thing, but you guys see the story about the secret government ipod
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:11.360]   Yes, yeah, I heard about that
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:16.960]   I wonder like how many of these weird, you know agreements and things happen between these companies and the government
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:18.960]   I have said I hadn't really thought about that
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:22.160]   But of course if the nsa is using that to actively exploit somebody
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:27.040]   And microsoft says we'll be better fix this they might say it would be nice if you left
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.680]   flying around a little bit longer. Yeah
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:35.680]   Nevertheless, I think that's not a good policy because of course a lot of people are going to get bit by that
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:42.000]   It's not a surprise. We have a massive ransomware problem right now. Mm-hmm. Garmon and the latest cannon
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.600]   Lost photos lots of people's photos because they got bit by ransomware
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:50.320]   Oh speaking of losing photos. Here's another one
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.440]   This is so annoying
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:55:00.400]   Uh, it didn't bite me, but just by the luck and the grace of god it didn't bite me if if you use lightroom on iOS
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:02.400]   Yes
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:04.960]   An update wiped out all your photos and presets
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:09.360]   And adobe said yeah, and they're not you can't recover that
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:15.200]   Yeah, oops. We're sorry. What was that Bob?
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:19.280]   Uh
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:25.440]   I don't know how many people were bit by this, but if a lot of people I think use lightroom now in iOS
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:28.000]   It's a nice. It's a really good way to do your photos
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:33.360]   If you did what adobe wants you to do which is use adobe cloud and sync your photos and presets
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.440]   You're okay. It would have been safe, but if you didn't because you didn't want to spend the money
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:42.240]   Um then this photo this update just clobbered it all
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:46.640]   This would be a shame that happened again. Yeah
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:55.280]   I don't know if this is directly related or not, but the like I my brother was visiting me recently and he
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:02.080]   He said he was he has a laptop that's ancient an apple laptop that's ancient and I was like
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.080]   Why don't you get a new one? And he said
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:10.160]   I'm worried about all my iTunes music and how I won't be able to like put it anywhere for me to listen to
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:15.760]   And I feel like there's this thing that's that's happening. I mean
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:22.480]   Where you you upload all of your stuff into the cloud and and and whatever and you could potentially
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:28.240]   Lose all of it. It just seems like you should be able to have like a hardened backup for that
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:32.080]   Yeah, right? I worry about the company should build it for you and yeah
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:38.000]   Well, actually and and so if you used adobe's backup you'd be okay, but the problem is it's expensive
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.920]   And and the problem also is I don't you know, I wonder if you backed up your iPad would you still
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:46.720]   Have it? I don't know
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:48.720]   I mean if you I would think you would
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:51.680]   Um
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.560]   I don't know I worry about like, you know, I'm not so much worried about somebody hacking into my bank yet and stealing my money
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:00.000]   I just have this fear that one day my bank is gonna lose all records
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.800]   Of how much money I have and and how do I prove to them that I really do have it actually?
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:09.360]   Yeah, actively terrifies me larry because you and I are getting to an age where we've we're you know
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:14.400]   Our savings are what we're gonna live on right pretty soon. Right our retirement savings and
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:20.160]   I actually do keep printouts of my you know, I went to know I'll go and print out so I can say no look I got this much money
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:26.560]   But yeah, I mean I I don't know if I maybe I should move it like split it up into 10 parts
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:32.000]   I guess that's what some people do. Yeah, that's inconvenient. Yeah
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.960]   I don't know what I'm gonna do my whole I've got this investment portfolio and follows one company and if they ever lost
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:41.280]   Yes, me exactly
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:45.120]   My whole my whole is in that my whole net worth. Yeah
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.080]   All $15 than
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:52.880]   So this secret iPod is an interesting story that kind of came out
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:54.800]   um
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:56.800]   from a former iPod engineer
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:02.000]   David Shayer he was the second software engineer hired in 2001
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.320]   And uh, he no longer works for apple, but he
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:14.000]   He posted on tidbits a post saying you know a funny a funny thing happened to me back in 2005
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.880]   Uh the director of iPod software my boss's boss
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.000]   Without knocking walked in closed the door behind me. He said I have a special assignment for you
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.800]   Your boss doesn't know about it
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:34.000]   You're going to help two engineers from the department of engine and energy build a special iPod
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.720]   report only to me
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:40.960]   The next day these two guys paul and matthew show up
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:48.640]   Uh that he said I would like to say they wore dark glasses and trench coats, but they were perfectly normal 30 something engineers
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:54.000]   They went to the conference room. They actually didn't work for doe. They worked for a contractor Bechtel
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.760]   They wanted to add some custom hardware to an iPod
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:05.280]   To record data from this custom high a hardware to the ipods disk in a way that would be invisible
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:11.600]   So the ipad had to look and work like a normal ipod. You wouldn't be able to see the data if you mounted the ipod
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:17.680]   They would do all the work. I was just there to help to consult so he never did learn what it was for
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.400]   But
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:24.000]   What could it be for and you can think of actually the spy uses for this right?
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:29.200]   Nope, you know, you're going into a top secret nuclear installation. You're gonna get a tour
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:34.640]   Or no, maybe it's not a nuclear installation. Maybe it's just a medical facility or something
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:40.720]   Inocuous, you're gonna get a tour and they're gonna look at you. They're gonna search you're gonna say what is this? Oh his ipod
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:44.080]   I love ipod, but it needs spears america
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:50.240]   Great country and you put it back in your pocket say yeah, maybe they're really careful and they plug it in and play something
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:58.320]   Let me listen. Oh, I love britney spears. No problem put it back in and it turns out it's uh, he suspected maybe a geiger counter
[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:01.040]   Yeah
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:06.480]   Well, never know because there is no there's no record of this. It's all been wiped out
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:10.720]   It just it happened and no one knows so you're right
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:16.960]   Conspiracy series. Yeah, it probably has a lot. Yeah. Yeah, you don't have to be a right winger to have a conspiracy theory
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:22.480]   It was the fifth generation ipod the ipod with video
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:27.280]   Fairly easy to open the case and close it without leaving obvious marks
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:31.680]   plus 60 gig drive lots of room to record extra data
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:40.320]   Mm-hmm and the hackable one the one they didn't sign. I think that was the last. Oh, that was key right. They didn't have to sign it
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:46.480]   Mm-hmm. Yeah, so the software could be modified without any issue nowadays. You can't do that
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:49.360]   You have to get apple to sign it would be much more complicated
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:53.600]   I don't know
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:58.960]   Cool story the custom i that never existed only four people at apple knew about it
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:05.280]   Uh, me the director of ipod software the vice president of the ipod division and the senior vice president of hardware
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:08.400]   None of us still work at apple. There was no per paper trail
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:12.720]   All communication was in person. In fact, he could be making this up completely
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:20.480]   It does your mission. Yeah, this ipod will self-destruct in 10 minutes
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:24.320]   Shh
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:27.920]   Um
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:31.600]   All right, let's one take one more break and then we'll talk about lift and uber because
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:37.120]   And also can we talk about air quality at some point during after the break? Yeah, I want to show this site you found
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:41.760]   This is really cool. Yeah, it really only applies to us in northern california because we can't know I know it
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:46.400]   The air quality has been the air is going east and
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:52.080]   Getting the smoke from our fires some some people are yeah, eastern. I don't know. Sorry. Sorry about that
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:02:00.400]   We are literally here as we sit in the twit studio surrounded by active wildfires that are for the most part not under control in any way
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.360]   So if I suddenly jump out and run out of the studio
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:08.560]   You'll know why there was a there's a
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:13.600]   Charum knows this link to this. There's a webcam somewhere that was on the fire line
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:19.600]   And it's it's it's it's a pretty dramatic picture of just a flame wall of fire and then it went offline
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:25.920]   If you why yeah, you can see why i shoulda they brought to you by monday.com a team
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:29.120]   management platform that is awesome
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:34.400]   If you're working in a distributed team these days in fact, that's probably the way it's going to be forever right now
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:41.920]   Uh, your team can plan manage and track work in one centralised place know exactly what's going on who's doing what how they're doing
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:48.080]   Easily automatically you can collaborate with teammates. You could track everything your teams working
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:53.600]   On wherever you are and they have templates for every industry. There's a podcast template ben
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:58.720]   You should take a look at this. So if you work with a team of five people or five thousand
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.400]   monday.com is the easiest way to keep everybody connected and on track
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:11.440]   It's a project management platform that makes effective teamwork possible anywhere even from home
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:16.720]   You keep all and nowadays. I honestly think even after covid. This is just going to be the way people do stuff
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:21.520]   So many companies are using and we're using it now. It's really cool. Keep your teams working one place
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:27.840]   Uh, no matter where the team is they'll all have one single source of truth they can look at
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:36.400]   That it's easy to track and manage work. So you know, always know who's doing what and when it's do and and what what their progress is
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:41.600]   It's also you can eliminate check-in meetings because you don't you just go to the dashboard you say up
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:46.960]   I see exactly where we stand. It's a great way to onboard new team members and get up to speed instantly
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:51.680]   You'll get up to speed with the remote ready templates. They're already built in and you can even get
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:58.160]   Uh, uh, uh, an onboarding specialist to work with you. We got eddy to work with us. It was really cool
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:04.080]   And incorporate it. He'll he'll help you set it up or she'll help you set it up so that it works for you
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:07.920]   It works with everything you're already using you don't get rid of anything
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:14.320]   We use zoom. We use slack. We use email calendars. We're big on google docs. All of that just integrates automatically
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:18.960]   In fact, they have no code automations so that your workflow is completely uh automated
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:20.640]   You don't even have to do anything
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:24.960]   But you've got this single dashboard you got all these places you're working with you got this single dashboard
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:30.240]   This is exactly where you stand and if you are using data to decide if you're planning
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:37.680]   If you if you can make data driven decisions easily because you don't have to guess you've got all the data right in front of you progress
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:41.840]   timelines budgets in any form you like I know some people like gantt charts
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:45.200]   They've got that but they've got timelines. They've got can ban boards
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:50.160]   Uh, if you like using kind of tables like spreadsheets. They've got that too any form you want
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.760]   That's what's beautiful about this is very customizable
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:56.240]   Makes it very easy to use
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:03.680]   You can you can make it work the way you work you can use the tools you already use but now you've got a dashboard that tells you exactly where you stand
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:09.760]   No wonder 100,000 teams are already getting things done with monday.com. You could try it free for two weeks

[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:42.560]   It's what we used to call web 2.0. What is it web 3 now with 4 5 what version of the
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:46.560]   Yeah, what the version of the web are we at right now? I don't know
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:53.360]   0.1 at this point going backwards. This is one of the first times in weeks. We haven't had a
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:56.320]   somebody works for cnet or
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:06:01.680]   Do you work in gadgets? No, you're part of oath no
[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:07.680]   Uh no longer oath it's for rise in media. Okay. Yeah, I'm so confused
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:13.600]   Apparently via comm cbs the old cbs interactive is I think about selling cnet
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.880]   uh
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:18.880]   Can you believe it's worth half a billion dollars?
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:24.560]   According to the wall street journal they're talking to red venture
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:28.400]   A digital focused holding company is always a holding company
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:31.280]   I don't know why
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:37.840]   Uh, it's not the first thing uh via comm cbs has sold off since the merger and they sold off simon and she's sold me off a few
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:40.320]   Weeks ago. They sold off larry maggot
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:45.200]   Uh by the way didn't uh cbs paid over a
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:49.680]   You have two billion dollars per cent. So that's yeah, that's a bad thing. Let's not mention that
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:55.760]   That's bad. This is bad for that. They will be losing about a billion and half dollars on the deal. Okay
[02:06:55.760 --> 02:07:00.400]   Yakes, that's so good. Yikes. That's so good
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:03.920]   All of these big mergers seem to pan out poorly, don't they?
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:08.560]   Yeah, the via comm cbs merger did not pan out well for a lot of employees
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:13.920]   Well, yes initially for employees, but ultimately I think the companies also don't fare that well
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:18.160]   I think you know the hp compact deal or the time Warner
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:24.480]   Uh aol do you know guys? I don't know what you're talking about. I think the fries. Oh, it's such a good
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:27.760]   Such a good deal
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:29.760]   Oh, it worked great
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:36.240]   Of course it did look at and gadgets actually you know where it does work. Well where they give you autonomy
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:40.800]   With where they don't try to shoehorn you into a larger corporate structure
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:44.560]   And I think that's what's happened with a gadget, right? They've kept the personality
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:48.640]   I don't know how the the stuff works up top, but generally
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:51.680]   Yeah, with the nobody's causing problems with us, which is nice
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:54.800]   I'm just gonna wait
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:08:00.160]   Eventually, uh, this holding company will want to sell it and I might be able to buy seen it which would be a great
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:05.440]   We'll do a kickstarter. It would be just a great full circle kind of a thing
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:14.400]   Okay, let's talk about uber and lift it's on and it's off. It's on again. I think they got an injunction appeals court has
[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:20.160]   For a while lift said we're we're leaving uber said we're leaving california. The appeals court has now
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:24.000]   Put on hold the cut requirement that the company
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:31.040]   Uh lift and uber treat their employee drivers as employees and not contracting employees all this comes from ab5
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:33.680]   Uh a very controversial
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:36.480]   Bill from the california state legislature
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:41.920]   Which bill it's cost me a lot of money. Yeah, not an employer as an employee as a contractor
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:44.400]   I've actually had to create an llc
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:49.760]   So I could continue writing a weekly column for the mercury news because they couldn't pay me as a freelancer anymore
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:56.240]   So now I have to pay hundreds of dollars a year in x xter fees that I wouldn't have had to pay otherwise to the state
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:00.720]   Avengers you have do you have contractors in california? Do you have employees?
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:03.280]   I don't I don't know how it works for us, but I have a lot of friends
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:07.280]   I have a lot of freelancer friends who are based in california and working in entertainment in hollywood
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:13.360]   And it's been a nightmare and I honestly have no idea how california keeps pushing through this even though everyone's saying
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:17.760]   You're killing freelancers by doing this. I have no idea what's going on. Yeah
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:21.440]   Um
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:23.840]   Yeah, I mean I think the initial
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.040]   Instinct here was to protect employees who are treated as contractors
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:33.920]   When they're really employees so that the company can avoid paying benefits
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:38.720]   Uh, and then I think it was particularly aimed at uber and lift
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:46.480]   But it had plus yeah, yeah, but it had really unintended consequences against a lot of people in our business who want to be freelancers
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.240]   right
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:51.360]   And facebook and my son's a musician and he hires musicians
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:57.360]   So that's causing a real problem in in that world as well, you know, because you know you hire a guy to do you know
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:00.800]   One session you have to make an employee. I mean that's kind of a nutty
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:03.280]   And I they may have they may have made some exceptions
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:07.280]   They made one exception with journalism if you can write up to 35 times a year
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:12.560]   But again, if you're writing a weekly column, then you've got to be either become an employee or set up an LLC
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:17.440]   Those of us in california see pretty much constant advertising from
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:23.840]   uber lift insta carton door dash because they have a ballot measure that's good. We're going to vote on november third
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:26.320]   prop 22
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:29.040]   That would create a third category of employment
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:35.840]   Which would include some benefits. There'd be a minimum wage auto insurance vehicle maintenance costs a health care stipend
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:42.560]   Uh, this is basically uber and lifts response. Well, we want to keep these guys, but we want to create this category
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:44.800]   And we'll kick in a little bit
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:50.480]   The uh, they've spent now more than $110 million on the yes on 22 campaign and I've seen those ads
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:52.400]   You know, the ads are heart tugging
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:55.120]   I'm a single mom and the only way I can keep my kids
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:57.840]   I want to be home for them when they're at school in school
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:03.280]   But the only way I can keep our family afloat is to work on my schedule and that's what door dash lets me do
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:07.440]   I see these ads all the time. I will be shocked if 22 does not pass
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:10.400]   We'll see
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:14.480]   So uber and lift get a little reprieve until this this vote can happen
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:19.120]   You know, but one thing I do want to say though is that one of the reasons why this bill got through
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:22.640]   Is because big companies like facebook and google and I think apple
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:28.480]   Employee people who work for contractors and pay them less give them fewer benefits
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:33.680]   And they do exactly the same kind of work as regular employees you so yeah, it's not if there isn't a problem
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:37.600]   I don't want to you know, that's exactly right. Yeah, well motivated. Yeah
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:42.080]   I was going to say a lot there's a lot of this in in public radio land
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:49.200]   Of people, you know, and they're all these sort of strange rules that whatever a thousand hours when I worked in in new york
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:51.520]   At WNYC there was a thousand hours rule
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:53.840]   um
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:57.360]   But there's a lot of you know folks who are essentially contractors
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:01.120]   But they're doing the same jobs as the folks who are not contractors and
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:08.800]   The company just doesn't you know doesn't seal the deal with them and make them true employees and gets away with it
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:10.160]   um
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:11.520]   It's a problem
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:17.840]   It would have put john cdvorek at a work because he he wrote I think when I was working with him on the radio
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:22.400]   He was very famously wrote a column a day for one journal or another. I mean he wrote
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:25.360]   Literally a column every I don't think he wrote a whole lot of them
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:30.000]   But a column a day and he wasn't employee of any of these places
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.800]   But he made a very nice living doing that and I don't see why somebody shouldn't be allowed to do that but
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:37.600]   With some protections, I guess
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:41.040]   Another factor is if you're a private contractor
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:45.120]   You have certain tax advantages like off it at office at home the right you're right
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:48.080]   Are those go away when you become an employee?
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:53.200]   So again, I'm not saying that there wasn't a reason but you really have to think of the unintended consequences sure
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:56.480]   Obviously john's like this. Well not to mention you have to start paying
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:02.320]   Uh, well the company pays half your uh, social security. So that's the good news. That's the good news. Yeah
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:06.640]   But your tax benefit is part of the problem exists honestly
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:11.040]   Really, this is a band-aid to cover the real big problem here
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:14.720]   Which is that most people in the United States get their health care through in a job. Yes
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:16.240]   as an employee
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:18.400]   And so if you're a contractor, you don't have health care
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:24.640]   And that's a big problem. We could solve this as Canada has as Britain has as every major
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:29.120]   Development nation in the world. Hey, oh, we cannot get this country to wear masks
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:33.760]   How hard is it gonna be to get actual my friend rene rich?
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:39.520]   Is it's awesome. He lives in kebec and he said, you know, I want to stop working as employee for i'm more
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.520]   I'd like to do my own thing on youtube
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:47.680]   And one of the key factors in his decision is I don't have to pay for health care because i'm in kebec. I have nationalized health care
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:53.440]   So I honestly think this is part of the really this is a symptom of a larger problem
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.640]   Which is that in america your health care comes in most cases comes from your employer
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:02.640]   And if you don't have an employer, you have to do it yourself and that can be
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:05.440]   Outrageously expensive
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:09.680]   It's also a problem in with, you know, historic unemployment that we're going through right now
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:12.480]   I think of all of the millions of people who fruit no fault of their own
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:16.640]   Lost a job and they are also going to lose their health care as well to that right
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:21.040]   Fresh air quality
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:25.760]   Is not something easily found here in the bay area right now
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:34.960]   Um, Larry has a great piece and forms about a website that this is a federal website fire.airnow.gov or is it state
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.520]   No, it's the general. Yeah, it's a tpa. Yeah. So by the way, you can access this
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:41.680]   This column through larry's world.com
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.840]   So you don't have to hunt it hunt it down at forbs
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:47.520]   But yeah, what so there's air now.gov
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:52.720]   Which is what i've been using up until now and when i where i live in paulo out to if i click on air now
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:58.880]   It tells me my air quality, but it turns out that the sensor is in redwood city, which is about 11 miles from here
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:00.880]   Yeah, you know, it's funny because i'm my apple
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:05.280]   Different world on my apple phone i got the air quality because i really want to know i know it's bad
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:08.960]   I can smell the smoke and it's got me the air quality for healdsburg
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:14.800]   Which is 20 or 30 miles away that's not and it's right in the middle of the fire. So of course it's going to be worse
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:19.760]   Right, so so with it with this fire.airnow.gov if i get that right
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:25.360]   You actually go to they actually have micro sensors as they say much less expensive and smaller
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:28.960]   They're i don't know if they're as accurate as the official epa ones
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:34.720]   But the epa has backed this as a beta project pilot project and it will tell you in my case
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:38.080]   There's a sensor i think on my block because when i go there on the map
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:40.880]   It's right next to my house i see
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:48.480]   You know what the conditions are so i'm getting much more local one. There are others too. I think purple air is a is a crowd sourced
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:52.560]   I've used purple air in fact last time we had the fires. I went to purple air all the time
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:59.120]   Yeah, but there are links to all these and oh, this is interesting. So this is actually the nearest one us is a purple air sensor
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:03.280]   And it says our air quality is 152, which is not good
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:06.240]   You do not want to be breathing that
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:11.360]   Oh, then I didn't realize that purple air was part of the so they're part of the epa network. That's very interesting. Yeah
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:17.440]   Yeah, that's the one nearest us here's another one that's not so far away. Let's see if that's also
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:20.080]   Purple air. Yeah, it's another purple air
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:22.800]   151 yeah, it's not good
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:29.280]   And by the way, you can buy these purple air sensors for they started about $197 if you want to i wouldn't i'd have your own
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:31.520]   Yeah, wouldn't mind
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:36.880]   So I have a dyson air purifier, which will give me the air quality in my home. I'm not sure how accurate it is
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:39.600]   But apparently it's okay in my house. Yeah
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:46.400]   This this map is also useful because it has also little flames where the fires are
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:52.720]   And this is one of the problems we have there's fires to the east of us fires to the west of us fires to the north of us fires
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:57.760]   To the south of us. There's not really anywhere we can go stuck in the middle with you stuck in the middle
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:00.480]   with flames
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:07.040]   But I think because of where a twit is we're probably all right john we're surrounded by paved part
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:08.960]   You know, we're not office park
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:13.440]   So there are some trees at home might be a little different john. You're all right. You're in downtown
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:15.440]   I don't think you're gonna be I think you're gonna be okay
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:21.360]   Um, my house however is surrounded by acres of dry grass
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:24.480]   That's not flammable. Is it?
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:29.040]   The only good news about this air pollution is that we all have masks now and so
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:33.280]   Too stupid to wear a mask for covid wear one for air
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:38.080]   The funny thing is I had masks at the beginning of this covid because I still had left over
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:44.560]   Last time we had fires me too was the wrong find it was the one without bound valves
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:48.560]   Yeah, well what I do is I wear a cloth mask over my n95
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:51.200]   That doesn't look weird at all
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:54.720]   Doesn't I don't care the way it looks. I don't want to give it john and I
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:18:00.000]   Did you buy the uh uv mask john and I bought a hundred dollar kickstarter mask
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.160]   And I think that they made their uh, I know I got charged just the other day
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:06.880]   Yeah, I think they made their goal
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:12.960]   It is a mask. It is an active mask. Let me see if I can find it. Well, actually I should be able to just click
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:15.520]   Yeah, all day active
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:18.000]   Uvc filtering
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.760]   This thing it has a battery and it's probably gonna weigh eight pounds
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:25.040]   And it's got a little vortex
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:29.200]   That uh, it passes all the air you're breathing through the vortex
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:34.480]   And then uvc filter not filter light so it's purifying it
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:37.120]   So it will be no good against smoke john
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:41.760]   It's not gonna do anything for smoke, but we won't get uh, but then we won't get covid
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:44.640]   Let's hope by the way
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:50.000]   Yeah, this is kuku. I don't know what way both ordered it just for fun. I think
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.160]   See up until recently I wouldn't have ordered this because I would have thought that covid is gonna go away
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:58.640]   But now I'm not convinced it's gonna go away. It is gonna go away like like magic like magic
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:02.080]   It may not be until next year, but it's gonna it makes you know, absolutely
[02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:05.520]   You know what uh the spanish flu misnamed because it came
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:14.800]   For I think they think it came from kansas the kansas flu in 1918 not 1917. Sorry. That's a movie in 1918
[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:17.520]   It's still with us
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:19.520]   That's h1n1
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:21.680]   That's our flu
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:23.680]   but it just uh, uh
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:27.680]   as you know one of the problems with these fluses is they they uh
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:29.600]   They
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:34.000]   Matesticize no what is the word? I'm trying to remember they evolve mutate they evolve
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:37.600]   And mutate. Yeah, so it evolved to a less deadly form
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:42.320]   The h1n1 bug, but it's still endemic. It's still all over the place
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:48.880]   It's still kill people still kills people still don't take the vaccines. We have the vaccines and people still don't take it
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:50.480]   So we may uh, we may have
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:55.440]   Coven it whatever. What scares they're not perfect. It's for covid if they're like the flu vaccine
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:59.520]   Yeah, we're gonna protect about maybe half 70 percent of us. I'll still take it
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:05.120]   You know once it's effective and safe, but right it's not it's no it's no panacea as gallam and says in the chat room
[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:10.000]   The good thing is that the uh pandemic at least it stopped world war two
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:13.680]   World war no it didn't
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:16.240]   World war three
[02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:20.000]   Maybe covid will prevent world war three. I told my wife I said, you know
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.960]   Save the mask because I bet this isn't the last time we have a pandemic
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:29.760]   Uh, I know that's the that's the thing you don't that's the thought you don't want to utter
[02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:31.520]   There's
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:37.680]   I've been thinking about that with my kids like i'm my kids. There are three and three years and three months
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:43.280]   And so i'm thinking if this if we get a vaccine in the next year
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:46.960]   They'll never remember this
[02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:53.120]   That's true that i'm worried that that's not what it's going to be i'm worried that it's going to be and
[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:55.840]   And I mean, I guess I suppose there's another
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:59.200]   You know, it's not a good way to look at it
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:05.040]   But there is another way to look at it which is if it happens over and over then this is just their reality for the rest of their lives
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:10.640]   And they'll never know that it was actually better. Right, but remember we've had sars. We had murs
[02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:15.280]   We've already had uh in the last 20 years a number of these
[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:22.560]   It just happened that they didn't escape. They didn't paint go pandemic just by virtue of you know, they're their morphology
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:25.280]   I think there's no reason to believe that we'll
[02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:28.240]   The places those viruses hit by the way
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:32.880]   dealt with them properly, right? That's why singapore and law the south east Asian countries
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:38.800]   They were able to deal with covid quickly because they had gone through this whole process. Um, yeah
[02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:44.400]   Well, I think this is where people won't wear a mask now if they're sick. Yes. Yes, right
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:48.400]   If we if we don't start if we don't use this as a lesson to start learning listening to scientists
[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:54.000]   Climate change is going to get us anyway or get your kids anyway. Oh no. Really? Hey, here's I just found out some good news
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:58.960]   We don't have to worry about any of this because we're going to be clobbered by an asteroid the day before election day
[02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:02.800]   Baby for the day before waiting to get out of it
[02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:05.360]   NASA says hey here it comes
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:08.880]   November 2nd
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:14.720]   celestial object 2018 vp1 which is a six and a half foot asteroid
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:17.440]   um
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:19.280]   NASA said look
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:25.440]   That's fine. It's only a point four one percent chance of it hitting us. I think the democrats are doing that of the way to
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:27.600]   trick the election
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:29.600]   Um, we just have to tell you
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:32.720]   You have to tell you chances are pretty good
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:36.960]   It's not that big six and a half feet if it were to enter our plant's atmosphere
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:40.640]   It just disintegrates. So really it's just a big-ass shooting star
[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:45.360]   So it's just a very another major symbol of the hellscape of this year. Yeah, right?
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:49.680]   If it weren't the year 2020, I would I would not tell you this story
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:52.240]   But just our luck
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:54.480]   This is the one that's going to get us
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:57.200]   The day before election day
[02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:01.120]   Uh, anyway, that's a nasty way to end this show and I apologize it's not
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:05.840]   It's it's it's gonna. It's gonna burn up. You're gonna be fine. This is why you should vote early
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:08.480]   Yeah, good point
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:10.480]   Oh
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:14.800]   Vote early. That's a good point. Yeah, you might not get a chance
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:20.800]   Uh on on monday to vote on tuesday. So vote on sunday. That's a good there you go
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:24.640]   Yeah, vote weeks before please come on. Okay. Yeah, bye wait
[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:27.680]   Better message stand on that's good
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:30.480]   Don't early
[02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:38.160]   Uh, let's see Ben Brock Johnson's at WBUR radio where he is executive producer of podcasts and a great guy
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:40.400]   He's at the Brock Johnson

[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:53.280]   That's pretty yes prestigious
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:55.600]   You're going from the tiffany network
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:57.600]   to the beeb
[02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:02.080]   That's pretty good, but not as much fun as being on twit. That's that's that's a lot of fun
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:07.040]   Well, I don't know now you're prepared if they ask you about that asteroid. You'll know exactly exactly
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:09.520]   What are you talking about tech right?
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:14.480]   Yeah, I do tech business. Yeah, like tech and it's you know, it's it's kind of a fill-in position
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:16.320]   I don't know how long I'm in it either
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:21.440]   But it made me feel good when I you know because what how you post it on facebook about the cbs thing
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:27.040]   And somebody from the bbc had read that and said hey join us. Oh, I say you'd be but jolly good on our show
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.720]   Do they do the questions to ask are they different than the kinds of things you get asked in american media?
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:37.200]   Yeah, because I I actually work out mostly out of the Singapore bureau. They asked me a lot about Asia
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:41.440]   They're very interested interesting and how this is going to affect china how this is going to affect or not china
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:46.160]   But you know that really interested in tiktok and in china a lot of a lot of asian orientation
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:49.840]   So I've had a lot more about tech in asia than I ever knew before
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:54.960]   Well, I think that you can make a case this might be the chinese century. Uh, we shall see
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:59.520]   Yeah, we shall see thank you larry great to have you on connect safely.org

[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:33.440]   So right getting used to not being an apartment and yeah house maintenance all that fun stuff
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:40.640]   But hey, this is good and I kind of wanted a safe zone to be prepared for this pandemic or future pandemic
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:43.120]   So hey, we have a we have a little zone which I don't want to say anything
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:48.080]   But but the city named key street corners does sound kind of like we're the stepford wives might have
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:51.120]   I'm just thinking every suburb is like that
