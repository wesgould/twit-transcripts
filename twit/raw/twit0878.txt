[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.560]   Traditional audio conferencing systems
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.800]   can entail lots of components.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.760]   Installation could take days.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.400]   And you might not get the mic coverage you need.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.320]   That's complex-pensive.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.760]   But Nureva audio is easy to install and manage.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.400]   No technicians required.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.360]   You get through full room coverage.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.160]   Now that's easy-canonical.

[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.240]   It's time for Twit this week in tech,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.520]   kind of a different show today because of something
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.840]   in the studio that went wrong.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.640]   I am going to be hosting it from my house.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.760]   And that's OK because we're still
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.240]   going to have a great Twit because we have a better
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.400]   than great panel.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.240]   First of all, I haven't seen Jill in so long.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.040]   Jill Duffy, Deputy Managing Editor at PCMag.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.120]   It is great to see you.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.600]   Welcome back.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.440]   Thank you.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.720]   It's a pleasure to be back.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.960]   How are things going to PCMag?
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.560]   Good.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   We are chugging along.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.200]   We just had our 40th anniversary of PCMagazine.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.440]   So a new editor in chief this year,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.040]   the first female editor in chief we've ever had,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.320]   and lots of big milestones.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.240]   And in my personal life, I just had a book come out early.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.400]   I remember this year.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.920]   Nice.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.560]   Appropriately enough as you're working from home today
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.680]   is the Everything Guide to Remote Work.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.920]   So everything you need to know from where to find remote jobs,
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.760]   how to interview, how to handle your--
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.600]   How to find things from home.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.800]   How to handle your A/B issues, the whole shebang in one book.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.120]   Did you think when you came out in January, oh shoot,
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.520]   I missed the pandemic.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.320]   I wish I'd written this faster.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.680]   No.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.560]   I had been covering remote work for a long time,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.760]   just here and there.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.520]   And then suddenly with the pandemic,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.280]   there was just such a need for more information.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.800]   So I felt really lucky to have been following the trends
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.400]   prior to that to know what are remote first companies do.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.200]   How do they do it?
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.880]   How do they do it?
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.200]   Well, what have they learned in the last 15 years
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.240]   they've been doing it?
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.640]   So it's been really great to be able to share some of that
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.600]   with people who genuinely need it right now.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   And continue to get it.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.400]   Well, as it turned out, yeah.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.280]   In fact, nobody wants to go back to work.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.720]   That's kind of the story we've been covering
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.280]   for the last few weeks and months.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.000]   Everybody says, yeah, let's not go back to work.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.800]   Let's work from home.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.840]   So perfect, perfect timing.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.160]   Who publishes that and where can we get it?
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.480]   It's Adam's Media and Simon and Schuster.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.840]   And you can buy it both in a physical print book
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.120]   or as an e-book.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.160]   Anywhere you buy your books, I like
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   to turn people on to indiebound.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.400]   Hooks you up with a local independent bookstore
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.560]   based on your postal code.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.360]   God knows.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.800]   Let's support the independence.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   Thank you, Joe.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.040]   Also here, Alex Wilhelm.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   It's great to see you, Deputy.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.560]   Oh, senior editor.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.800]   You're not a deputy.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.440]   You're a senior at TechCrunch.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.240]   Actually, I'm neither.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.440]   I've gotten promoted.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.520]   Let me edit that.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.720]   Who are you now?
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.280]   I'm the editor in chief of TechCrunch Plus,
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.880]   which is our stuff behind the paintball.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.720]   Oh, nice.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.400]   Is that with a plus sign or PLUS?
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   How do we spell it?
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.560]   Oh, it's with a plus sign or if you're on Twitter,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.640]   it's PLUS because that's how usernames work.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.200]   Great to see you.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.360]   Good to see you, Alex.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.880]   Also with us, thrilled to have Dan Gilmore back
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.640]   on our microphones such as they are today.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.240]   Dan is a co-founder of the Arizona State University News
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.880]   CoLab at the Walter Cronkite Journalism School
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.120]   and a journalism expert and a great fellow
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.120]   and a great fellow.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   Thank you, Dan.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.120]   Good to see you again.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.760]   Great to be back.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.920]   So I thought when we were preparing the show that
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.640]   WWDC be the big story, well then Cheryl Sandberg decided to quit.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.360]   And that has to be the big story.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.520]   Let me start with you, Jill, because Cheryl became almost a feminist icon some years
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.240]   ago when she published Lean In.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.760]   She survived, you know, the death of her husband and a lot of adversity and became
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.160]   more and really more and more important at Met.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.560]   I don't think she had the role when she first started.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.000]   She had the name, chief operating officer, but I think she really became more and more
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.200]   important as Mark Zuckerberg's partner over the years.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.840]   Yeah, I mean, she was always kind of known as the grownup in the room, right?
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.840]   She was the one who brought a little bit of an air of professionalism, kind of held things
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.520]   together.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.240]   And it's hard to judge anybody for stepping down when they've been in a position for a
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.480]   long time in a company that's had taken a lot of heat and rightfully so.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.360]   It sounds like there may be some issues related to burnout for her.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.680]   So, you know, I don't fault her for stepping down.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.840]   Absolutely not.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:10.000]   Although, Meta had just been kind of reorganized with the enunciation of Nick Clegg to do global
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   affairs.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.400]   I think they had a triumph for a while.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.880]   So, they had Mark Zuckerberg handling the software and the technologies and then Shell
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.920]   Samberg running the business and then Nick Clegg, the government attacks.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.360]   Alex, what is this due to the structure?
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.800]   She won't be leaving till this fall.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.240]   But does this change how Netflix, how Meta runs?
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240]   I think so.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.480]   I think it's indicative of the change in the company's focus.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.240]   I mean, Cheryl Samberg is synonymous with the company's advertising business because she
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.160]   was really brought on to build that.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.920]   And now as the company moves more towards the Metaverse, which I think is one of the squishiest
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.960]   concepts in all of the history of technology, I think she makes less sense as the obvious
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   number two.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.440]   And honestly, just speaking as a human, who wants to be one of two and then suddenly told
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   you to be one of three.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440]   Well, that's true.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.800]   It feels like a demotion by delusion.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.200]   Although, I would think she would want the shield that Nick Clegg, I mean, the biggest
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.760]   headwind for Meta are the East Asia's government inquiries, right?
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.760]   And let Nick handle.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.080]   That's what I felt like Mark was saying.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.480]   We don't have to do this, Cheryl.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's just like Nick came all that.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   He's like Mikey, he'll do anything.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.840]   Just let him do it.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.000]   I just, you know, if I was her and I had had this one particular job that I had run for
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.080]   so long and in the company that I had essentially built, the financial side of at least said,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.640]   hey, we're going to pivot and do something else entirely different.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   Right.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.000]   I would be like, cool, have fun.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I've already made my money.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.480]   I'm going to go sit on a boat and you would never personally, you would never hear it from
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   me again.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.200]   You'd be busy enjoying the sun and an endless supply of, I don't know, margaritas or whatever.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.760]   She in an interview after she announced her resignation, she said, this shouldn't be taken
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.720]   as a sign that Meta is moving away from the advertising business, which is probably right
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.480]   since it's 98% of their revenue.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.800]   Javier Olivan will succeed her.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.280]   He is head of product engineering and he'll take over ad sales as well.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.320]   But I wonder, Dan, if this isn't really, as Alex says, kind of a sign of the times for
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.080]   Meta that they are moving to the Metaverse.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.720]   Hard for me to know, I should make a disclosure before I say anything.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.440]   And that is that the Facebook journals and projects funded one of our projects.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.520]   As it did, Jeff Jarvis's as well.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.920]   They've been very good actually doing that.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:40.640]   So I'm saying that there's a sort of this triumph that was forming.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.680]   It's hard to be part of a triumph where one person controls everything.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.120]   That's all that shares.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:57.320]   I think the best description of the structure of Facebook is that it's an empire with an
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   emperor.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.960]   And it isn't her and it isn't the, it isn't Clegg.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.480]   It's Zuckerberg.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:13.400]   So it's hard to suggest to me anyway that much is going to change.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.720]   She says she wants to focus on her philanthropic efforts.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.160]   And I, you know, she intimated that for a woman with a high profile, this is an important
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.560]   time to become an activist, probably referring to Roe v. Wade and other women's issues.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.440]   But there's also been some, you know, nattering about maybe political ambitions.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   Dianne Feinstein's 88.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.640]   She's up for a reelection in two years.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.240]   Our senator from California.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.520]   I could see you think Jill, that's part of the equation.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.200]   You know, it's not something that I follow very closely.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.000]   I think, you know, the larger issue that I see here is that we put so much pressure and
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.680]   spotlight on people who are executives.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.280]   What are you going to do next?
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.280]   What are you going to do next?
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   What are you going to do next?
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.280]   I don't know.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.520]   I don't follow any of her political ambitions.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.840]   So I don't know.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.600]   But, you know, I don't know.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.480]   I'd be just as happy to see people, you know, fade out and do what they want to do.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.160]   The thing I'd throw in there, Jill, is that I mean, if you keep going to Don, you know,
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.880]   Don, you know, you're going to be a fan of those and you keep sitting on stage.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.960]   You put yourself into the conversation to a degree.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.560]   Now, that doesn't mean that she has to do anything next.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.440]   I mean, again, I would be on a boat.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.680]   But you know, Dianne Feinstein was my senator when I lived in California for a while and
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.600]   it's probably time for a fresh face.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.880]   And we have seen, I think, business people, generally speaking, presume that they can translate
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.360]   their experience into the political sphere.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.840]   Don't forget how our Schultz Starbucks man himself tried to run for president.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.840]   I believe it was before Biden ran and--
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.280]   Didn't get very far either, did he?
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.280]   No.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.440]   Turns out money and business acumen do not always translate into electoral politics.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.720]   And so to me, I doubt that just because I don't think it would go that well.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.680]   I kind of-- I Jill, I agree, burnout is probably a big part of it.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.240]   She's estimated that her net worth is $1.6 billion.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.240]   She doesn't probably have to do anything.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.240]   She's got kids.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.600]   She remarried and-- or is about to remarry actually next month.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.600]   That might be the other reason.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.000]   And she's got a new family.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.040]   She might want to spend time with them.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.040]   And you know what?
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   God bless her.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.960]   That's not an issue really for us to worry about.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.600]   More interest is what it means to meta.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.440]   Mark's spending $10 billion a year.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.920]   He's got 18,000 engineers working on whatever this next thing is.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.280]   Metaverse is clearly.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.360]   That's Mark's focus.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.520]   And by the way, people have said that Javier, her successor, is not going to be the same
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.080]   powerhouse that Sandberg was.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.360]   So maybe this is kind of-- is it kind of the beginning of the deceleration for Facebook,
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.560]   the social network?
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.680]   You know what's funny about this.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.360]   If you think about the end of the Google era with the founders, they kind of stepped
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.360]   away.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.120]   So did Eric Schmidt, who was their adult in the room, back to Jill's earlier point about
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.800]   what Cheryl's done for Facebook, Meta, received the opposite.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.680]   We're almost going to double him down from Zuck, if you will, because if the replacement
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.320]   for Cheryl's going to have less power internally, and as Dan pointed out, it certainly soft
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.520]   power, because it's not based on voting control of the company.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.520]   He seems to concentrate more power back in the hands of the monarch or the emperor, depending
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.200]   on which phrase he preferred.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.480]   Well, he doesn't have the power, regardless.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.960]   He's making a big bet.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.040]   I mean, if all your money comes from advertising, and that will probably continue for some time,
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:44.280]   still to focus so much of your energies and the 18,000 engineers and all that money on
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.960]   the metaverse is a big, is a big bet.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   It's a big gamble.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.600]   18,000 engineers doing what is my question?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   Good question.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   Maybe I got that number wrong.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.760]   I think that's what that's what I remember.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.000]   I might have that wrong.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.960]   I mean, Jill, Dan, do you guys play games?
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.960]   Are you interested in the metaverse?
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.480]   Because to me, like I'm a gamer and a person who has a PC that can run the stuff, and I
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.440]   keep waiting to care interest.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.680]   Just I don't know.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.240]   No, you know what?
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.000]   Many, many years ago, I was, I worked for a game developer magazine.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.240]   I was the managing editor of Game Developer Magazine.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.120]   This is the early 2000s.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.400]   There was so much talk even then about what's going to happen with mobile games, because
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.480]   that was still like pre-iPhone days.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.880]   What are mobile games going to do?
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:33.200]   How they're going to, you know, is in custom advertising to you based on your location,
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.520]   and there was this whole immersive technology idea, which I guess we're now sort of calling
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.240]   the metaverse.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.880]   It comes up in conversation.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.240]   But it's a matter of what do people actually want?
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.440]   What do people want to engage with?
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.000]   And I think you'll always get a slim number of people who are willing to go all in and
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.440]   try it out and be on second life and have their classroom there and whatever else.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.280]   But like, will it catch on with everybody?
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   My answer is no.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.440]   I don't think it's going to be a big explosion.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.240]   It's a hard thing when you're, you know, a tech company, we always talk about the innovators
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.240]   dilemma.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:15.960]   And we have Apple's in the same boat where 52% of their revenue now comes from one product.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:21.360]   It's always a challenge to say, well, you know, this engine isn't going to go forever.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.240]   What's the next lily pad we're going to leap to?
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   And I don't, I think it makes sense for Facebook to be looking for another lily pad.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.560]   But I agree with both of you.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.240]   I don't feel like the metaverse is going to be the next big thing.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.240]   That's what I think.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.360]   You think that if you read a lot of science fiction.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:42.480]   They've done a good job of sort of using acquisitions to spread out what their business
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.880]   does a little bit, right?
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.000]   Like, if you look at WhatsApp and Instagram and Facebook, those are sort of the three big
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   pillars, right?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.360]   But they own a whole lot more than that.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.960]   And I think that may have been strategically in a business sense, their best move to date
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.560]   is sort of diversified through, through acquisitions.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.560]   But how do they monetize WhatsApp?
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.520]   They haven't, I mean, they don't, they're not putting ads.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.840]   I haven't used WhatsApp in a long time.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.840]   They don't put ads in it, right?
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.560]   I don't know if they can even monetize that.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.480]   That's really more of a service than a, than a profit center.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.960]   Instagram, I do use and it's worse and worse all the time.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.120]   Isn't it?
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120]   It's terrible.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.600]   I see photographers now saying, where do we go?
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   What do we use?
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.280]   This is not a good place to show off your photography.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.960]   It's now, it's looking like Facebook.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.400]   It's so algorithmic that you don't know what you're going to see.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.400]   I have what I see.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.160]   I don't even know who these people are.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.360]   Maybe some of these issues are, this is, you know, my fond wish that never has come true
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:47.200]   yet, that we're going to go back to a truly decentralized creator economy.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:54.040]   Not, not a web three, by the way, as it's developing, but we're, we're, we're logging
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:00.560]   the way it was, makes a comeback where a number of things happen to give people their own platforms
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:07.640]   where they don't live or die at the, uh, whim of a couple of very large companies.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:15.280]   So if, if I had a wish, it would be that all of these moves in the end become irrelevant.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   Okay.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.280]   Don Quixote.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.400]   No, I mean, shout out to Dan for saying that.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.240]   I mean, the, the, the, I agree with you.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.240]   100%.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.000]   Look at the popularity of, or email newsletters.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.360]   Well, that's true.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.480]   There is this kind of new writer as a tour thing.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.120]   Maybe that, maybe that's some of it.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.880]   Uh, podcasting is consolidating.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.600]   It's going to be a few big companies and that's, it's noteworthy on newsletters that a venture
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.160]   or funded company is trying to basically create a monopoly there.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.320]   So, uh, on a platform basis.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.120]   So, uh, be careful.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.120]   We get what we wish for.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.840]   Isn't that what Tim Wu says happens though?
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.040]   It's inevitable is this kind of consolidation.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   Nation.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.040]   Yes.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:05.200]   He was talking about telecom in, and, and media in a different way, I think, but his, yes,
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.600]   Tim's book is must read for everybody on this topic.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.240]   Can we go back to the Leo's point about Instagram becoming Facebook because there seems to be
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.280]   a parallel here between what we observe in the world of FinTech and what we see in the
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.480]   world of social networks and FinTech.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.120]   All companies end up looking like one another.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.520]   Like Square started off with a little credit card reader.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   Now it does, you know, a zillion million things that are very similar to what SoFi does, which
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.400]   are often kind of becomes the same thing over time.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.960]   I wonder if there's like a crappification end point for all social networks when they
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:41.800]   essentially become so, uh, over optimized for near term ad incomes that the user experience
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.560]   must be essentially whacked with a stick repeatedly.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.040]   I think there's a lot of examples that, you know, it's interesting is that Twitter, you
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.880]   would expect Twitter to become like that.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.240]   And it seems to be resilient to that somewhat.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.400]   They're killing tweet deck, Leo.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.720]   They're killing my, my, okay.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.680]   They're killing the Mac app, which is just an electron interface to the web.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.920]   The web is still going to be there.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.560]   You can use a browser.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   No.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.680]   Well, I love to take it's the only way is use Twitter because you can control it and
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.680]   there's no ads.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:18.880]   I go to great lengths to not put apps on devices and use web interfaces wherever possible.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.320]   I wrote an article recently about how I got myself off of Instagram the same way.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.680]   So I don't use the Instagram app.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.520]   I still look at it, but I use it on a mobile web browser and it is so pared down.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.880]   It looks nothing like TikTok when you use it that way.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.840]   You don't get as many videos pushed in your face and you only see content from people
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.840]   you follow.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.440]   It's adding a little bit of friction can help.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   That's brilliant.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   I'm going to have to start doing that.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:48.320]   I don't want Instagram is the only Facebook property, meta property that I have an account
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   with.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.960]   It's just so that because they set it up, you can't show Instagram pictures and I like
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.920]   to show people's images and stuff without an account.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.240]   Actually the same thing with Facebook, but I don't care.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:04.000]   When I pulled up Cheryl Sandberg's message, there's a one third of the screen is you're
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.320]   not a member.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.320]   Join login.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   No.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   No.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.840]   You know, you mentioned that you don't use WhatsApp and Leo, as you know, I've kind of
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.440]   lived in a couple of different places around the world and it's really hard to impress
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.160]   upon people in the United States, how much WhatsApp is used outside of the US.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.800]   So it's not just for person to person communication, but it's also businesses.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.120]   So you know, my friends in Columbia, when they order takeout food, they WhatsApp the
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.040]   restaurant and send a direct payment.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.440]   And that's how their food comes.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:43.720]   Like WhatsApp really fills in a lot of gaps in mobile offerings outside of the US in ways
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.400]   that people don't seem to understand.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.200]   And the other kicker to this is that a lot of phone companies outside of the US will
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.160]   offer WhatsApp messages or Facebook messenger messages for free so that doesn't deplete
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.160]   people's data usage.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.640]   And that's really how they've gotten their claws in.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.280]   I'd like to hear more scare quotes when you said free.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:09.400]   But remember internet.org, that was Facebook's attempt to become the internet for a whole
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.320]   bunch of developing nations.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.200]   India said, no, we have a good experience with colonialism.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.400]   We have a history.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   Not this time.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.440]   Not this time.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   Not again.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.560]   We're having this is kind of a different kind of twit.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.720]   It's a little more I think it's a twit kind of fireside chat after hours sitting around
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.160]   talking with smart people.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.880]   Jill Duffy is here for PC magazine from ASU's Walter Cronkite school.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.880]   Great to see Dan Gilmore.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.880]   And of course, my good friend Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch Plus.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.680]   Or as we say it in France, TechCrunch.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   TechCrunch.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   I'm here for that.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.400]   If someone is in turn that sense, we can just keep this going because why not?
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.920]   We're going to take a little break, come back.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.000]   Lots more on this weekend tech.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.960]   Hey, our show today brought to you by something I've been telling my kids for years.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.960]   Wealthfront.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   I know it's so much fun to buy NFTs and fantasize about how much money you're going to make
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.120]   off your doge coin investments.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:15.440]   But honestly, playing the stock market, buying individual stocks, buying cryptocurrency,
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.960]   that's fun.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   But it's a little risky.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.400]   I would say it should be enjoyed in moderation, something like casino gambling or questionable
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   street food.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.520]   When it comes to building your wealth for the future, day trading stocks is not the secret
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   to success.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.960]   Wealthfront in fact has a ton of data show that time in the market almost always beats
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.480]   timing the market.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.800]   Wealthfront is going to build based on questions to ask you, things like your risk tolerance,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.440]   your goals, your planning.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:50.400]   What are you planning for retirement, college fund, buying that first house?
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.720]   So you're going to tell them what your plans are, your time frame is, and then they will
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.840]   build a globally diversified portfolio.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.400]   Three important words, globally diversified portfolio, that will automatically optimize
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.840]   over time to hit the goals you set and the risk level you choose.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.720]   You also get things that only wealth front could do.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.920]   They invented something called tax loss harvesting.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.920]   They actually invented the software.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:20.320]   It basically lets you, when the stock market is down, reap tax benefits so that when the
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.720]   stock goes up, you have something to offset your gains.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.440]   It's actually a brilliant way to balance your investment.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   That's what Wealthfront's all about.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.440]   You can personalize your portfolio.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.040]   They have a selection of funds.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.800]   Again, portfolio, handpicked by Wealthfront's financial experts.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.880]   Categories include social responsibility, clean energy.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:47.160]   Yes, you can do cryptocurrency, but by creating that basket of funds, it's a much less risky
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   investment.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   They've got cannabis.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.880]   They've got all kinds of stuff because they know people like to have a little bit of say
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.680]   in what the investments are.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.240]   When we started talking about Wealthfront some years ago, they were just getting started.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.320]   They are now 27 billion in assets.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.400]   Half a million people use it.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.120]   And good news, Investopedia just named Wealthfront, the best RoboAdvisor for 2022.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.400]   And we're just halfway through the year to start building your wealth and get your first
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.760]   $5,000 managed free for life.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.160]   Go to wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:28.200]   W-E-A-L-T-H WealthfrontFRONT.com/twit to start building your wealth.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.040]   And start it today, wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.600]   And now back to our panel.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:43.360]   Back again with our panel, I guess if we're talking about meta's ambitions and the metaverse,
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.920]   we can't leave out Apple's supposed metaverse ambitions.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:55.760]   Tomorrow, WWDC, the worldwide developers conference, Apple seems to have already gone, I think,
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.920]   to, you know, Apple, I'm convinced.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.320]   Maybe you can, maybe you can, Dan, give me some insight into this.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:07.560]   We used to be the Wall Street Journal, but there are various journalists or gossip monitors
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:14.640]   or whatever that Apple can go, sub-rosa go to and say, "Hey, don't say I said this,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.160]   but we're not going to announce anything on Monday."
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.240]   And then you'll see this kind of bubbling up.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   Sometimes it'll say, "Well, I've heard from my sources, but more often it's just I have
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.720]   a feeling."
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.520]   And that's what I'm starting to see from Mark Gurman, Ming Chicoi, and others, some of
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.840]   the rumor mills, Renee Ritchie on Macbreak Weekly kind of echo this, "Don't get your
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.320]   hopes up tomorrow for hardware.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:43.040]   We're thinking maybe tomorrow Apple would announce or at least talk about its first,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.480]   we know that, or we've heard that they plan to release this year, headset."
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.480]   Dan, is that how Apple works?
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.520]   So they kind of do this little subtle.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.800]   I can only speak to how Apple used to work.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.760]   And also for context that I was never the one they leaked to.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.320]   We never there.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:13.200]   But they selected their journalists and made sure they were well cared for.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:20.680]   Well, Monstrik, Steve Jobs was basically groomed Wall Monstrik to use a monitor.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:27.600]   And Stephen Levy and a few others, there was a group that Steve Jobs favored and that
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.680]   was that.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:37.480]   But I don't know about this idea of spreading a "don't say that because it's not going
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.760]   to happen" thing, though smart companies do that.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.760]   Sure.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.920]   Well, they want to lower expectations, right?
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.960]   They don't want the story from tomorrow to be Apple didn't announce it.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   What's wrong?
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.720]   That's unexpected Apple didn't do.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   That's a weird...
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.520]   I'm even hearing they might have announced any hardware.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.240]   About half of WWDCs, it's a developers' conference.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.000]   They don't announce any hardware.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.840]   Well, they often announce something that developers want to see like a high-powered desktop or
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.840]   laptop.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:18.200]   But it wouldn't surprise me to see some hardware announcements in the processor category like
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:28.280]   the M2 and some indication of where they're going with the headset, which the more I read
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.720]   about the less I understand.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.280]   Can we just push back against the Apple PR strategy here and just get outraged that they're
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.920]   not going to show off the headset tomorrow?
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   Like, screw this pre-work.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.920]   I'm not looking for it now.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   I'm not looking for it.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.920]   How dare they?
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.920]   What a disappointment.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.040]   I'm only being half facetious because I am excited about what Apple is going to build in
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:50.640]   the headset department because, like I said, waiting for this technology to grab me and
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.920]   Apple has a history of making me buy new stuff.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.320]   I didn't have a top $1,000.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   I didn't have a top $1,000.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.640]   14 cameras.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:03.320]   Some of them pointing out, but some of them pointing in, these are all rumors, so that...
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.680]   We have this vision of googly eyes in the front so that you can...
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.960]   Because you're wearing this headset, you know, I don't know.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.920]   I'll have to simulate it with this.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.520]   I'm wearing the headset.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.640]   No one can see what I'm thinking or looking, but if you put googly eyes in the front...
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.400]   So these are all rumors.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.560]   For some reason, more than two screens, you only need one per eye.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.200]   Don't know what the other screens would be, but maybe that would make sense.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.440]   Then there's two in the back and one in the front.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.600]   These are all rumors.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   Here's the thing.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   It is a developers conference.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.720]   If you want developers to line up, you get one chance a year to pitch them on what the
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.080]   thing that they should be working on.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:47.160]   If you've got something called RealityOS, which that's the trademark, you better tell
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.080]   them about it tomorrow, right?
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   I don't know.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.720]   I'm going to challenge that idea that Apple gets one chance to persuade people of anything,
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:05.440]   because the obsession of tech journalism with Apple means that they could drop an announcement
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:12.960]   at 4 AM Saturday morning and it would be worldwide news by 11.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.560]   May I call it?
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.160]   We'd be talking about it for days.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   You're right.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160]   You're right.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   They don't need this tomorrow.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160]   But you're right, though, Leo.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.400]   They do act like congregate developers provide...
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.760]   This is when you say to developers, here's our priorities.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.760]   I think you're both right.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.760]   I think Dan's right.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.040]   You could make ripples, but I do think getting the actual developers together into one room,
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.080]   quote, quote, is relatively infrequent.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.920]   And it's why big companies that have platforms host developer-focused events.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.800]   I've been going to these since I was 22.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.280]   Are you going tomorrow?
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.520]   No, I have been assigned to do the stock market reaction post, which is usually me just talking
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.520]   about the stock market.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   The stock market down.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.520]   It's a philosophical perspective.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.520]   Does it always go down?
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.040]   You buy on the rumor selling the news?
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.040]   Is that old hat?
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.360]   Leo, I'll tell you this.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.320]   Brian Heater at TechCrunch, every time there's an Apple event, asks me to cover the stock market
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.120]   changes and every time I start off with him, and once again, nothing happened.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.720]   And I run a whole post about this, and it's an absolute blast.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.960]   It's become like an art project.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   Well, yeah.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   And now you have boilerplate.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.360]   You can just stick in and you can take the day off.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.360]   Right.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.160]   Then again, you've already written the story.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.040]   Oh, you're going to get a little red check from the professor over here if you keep that
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   up.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:24.440]   Well, I'm trying to think of an example of when Apple has announced or previewed some
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.040]   kind of hardware before they were really ready.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.040]   Oh, yes.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   I feel like that's not.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.040]   I'll give you some.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.600]   Well, both Mac Pros, they've announced seven months ahead of time.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.520]   The first iPhone they announced in January, didn't ship till June.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.560]   So here's the, I think the rule of thumb.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.600]   If it's something they're selling and it's the new version, they don't want to Osborne
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   it.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.720]   They don't want to kill the sales or the thing they're selling right now.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.800]   But when it's a new technology, they do want to get developers in line.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:01.000]   And so this would, I think they could announce, you know, they have to have enough, right?
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.400]   They have to have enough of a, of an assurance of what they're telling developers is going
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.680]   to allow the developers to then start thinking and working and prototyping, whatever.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.680]   Right.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.720]   Like it needs to be far enough along.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.480]   That's, that's my only, my only thought about it with hardware is, you know, that's
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   the real difference.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.640]   You know, I'm, I'm somebody who covers software and the issue with software is you can write
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.920]   a review of somebody's software and then they can come back to you two days later and say,
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.480]   well, we fixed it and we changed it.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.920]   Update your review, please.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.800]   And that doesn't happen with hardware.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.400]   The most you'll get is maybe a firmware update a few months later addressing some issue, but
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:42.840]   like hardware really has to be locked down before you can start selling it to people at
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.360]   any level.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.040]   And software, you have a lot more flexibility.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:53.000]   So if you had a bingo card for tomorrow, you would, would you maybe say we've got a reality,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.480]   OS, we want you to start, because Apple does have VR technologies for the iPad and the
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   iPhone.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.840]   They have a format called USDZ.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.200]   And so they could say, Hey, here's a new toolkit.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   They do have trademarked the reality OS.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.120]   They could say, uh, we're going to ship a beta of reality OS.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.680]   So you can start playing with it next week.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.400]   I mean, it is, it's, it's less meaningful without hardware, of course, but, uh, yeah.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.080]   And do you really want to ruin that surprise of here's the new hardware?
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.320]   Here's the thing that we want you to get excited about and buy, buy, buy.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.320]   Right.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.520]   I mean, I think WWDC for me is, is always so much about the OS update.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:39.240]   And we know years we've seen this, this trend of like Mac OS is going to be more in sync
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.600]   with iPad OS and, and iOS or whatever it's called at this point, like kind of getting
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.040]   that convergence together.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.440]   Like I think that's been the long journey.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.640]   And I'm expecting to see a whole lot more of that.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:32:04.400]   That raises a really interesting question too about the Mac OS and the iOS merging, uh, which
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.440]   way it's going to go in the control sense.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.880]   And I've been saying for a long time, uh, hoping I'm wrong that I think Apple is planning to
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:22.400]   lock down the Mac OS the way it has locked down the portable device OS.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.160]   And I continue to hope I'm wrong, but you know, a control free company with something
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:31.080]   that's open is kind of a contradiction.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:39.160]   And if the more they make one like the other, let's see which subsumes the other and I know
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.240]   where my bet is.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:47.320]   Mark Gurman in Bloomberg on the second three days ago said Apple will not significant changes
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:56.040]   to the iPads software this week, making it more actually Dan like Mac OS, a redesigned
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:01.400]   multitasking interface, windows that can actually overlap other windows, which is something
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.760]   historically the Mac OS never, I mean iPad, I always never want to do that.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.160]   So Mac OS does.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.640]   So it may actually become, we'll see.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   Well, that's you.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.160]   I'm always afraid of what they're locked down.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:20.200]   But what that what you've described there is a user interface issue rather than a question
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.760]   of whether they can do that.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:32.960]   And if they still don't let you load a Mac OS piece of software, then then in fact it's
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.320]   still the iOS just changed.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.320]   Right.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.960]   I think the decision though to make the iPad a bit more like a laptop computer or more
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.920]   like a desktop environment makes a lot of sense because I recently bought an iPad Pro
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.600]   and I'm amazed at how I can't do much with it.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.640]   And it's essentially the same hardware as an M1 MacBook Air.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.640]   Right.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.640]   And yet it's the software makes it appear to be a very large stupid iPhone and like it's
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.720]   a bubble because it's a piece of hardware.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.120]   It's actually one of the sleekest investments ever purchased.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.240]   I've said this again and again.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.640]   This thing is amazing.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.840]   But it but the software just doesn't support it.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.840]   It's good for chess.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.840]   I've discovered.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.360]   I play a lot of chess and I always a lot of chess on that.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.000]   It's so funny you should say that because I just bought a chest.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.120]   You can see all the chess crap I have.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.200]   I just bought an electronic chess board that plugs into it.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:31.120]   And then you play the you load up a game here and it lights up on the chess board.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.800]   So you'd have to look at this anymore.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   And the I know it's a good thing.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.720]   This is a safe space for nerds because otherwise you would take on speeding right now.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.760]   You may be right Dan.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.960]   This actually isn't incompatible with your notion that Apple might be locking down Mac OS
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:54.440]   because if they make iPad OS more like Mac OS and iPad is really locked down.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.240]   Why not make Mac OS more locked down?
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.960]   I'm arguing against that is that people like you and me who want the Mac to be an open operating
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.520]   system will be very move to Linux or something.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:12.280]   Tim Cook has been getting more and more shrill about the dangers of letting people load software
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.440]   that they actually would prefer to use.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:22.520]   I mean he's been yelling and screaming and Apple leads the leads all industry in fighting
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:27.040]   against right to repair legislation where you could actually you know why he talks about
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:31.480]   saying you purchased because he doesn't want the app store to be unlocked.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.640]   Well it's money.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.920]   This is money money and control but they ought to be at least a little more straightforward
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   about it.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.920]   I agree.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.880]   That's why you and I are never going to Apple campus again.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:51.200]   You know I have a bunch of Windows and Mac machines in my little home office here and it's
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.360]   funny the PC that I install apps on has exploded into flames several times because I picked
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.440]   up apps that I wanted to pick up that Steve Jobs or sorry Tim Cook didn't approve for me.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.440]   It's a BS argument.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.880]   I mean like we the Windows has been open for so long as has Android.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.880]   Yeah thank you.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.240]   Yeah and so to me it's I find it sad that it's self-serving.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:14.720]   Yeah I'm probably the only one here who uses Linux as my day to day operating system but
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:24.800]   I'm Microsoft is so envious of Apple you can see this and you can also see as they make
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   it harder and harder to do things with Windows 11 like you cannot set up Windows 11 unless
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.360]   you sign into a Microsoft account cannot be done.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.760]   That's a very Apple like kind of thing.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.640]   Yeah even Apple doesn't make you do that.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.880]   You can have a local account on a Mac.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.920]   That's true you still can do that.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.480]   Just try and do anything after that.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.200]   I just got a Dell XPS 15 brand new one with I wanted to take a look at Intel's 12th gen
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:01.400]   processors because they're trying to compete with the M1 series and it's Windows 11 and
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:09.200]   Jill you may want to weigh in since you're at PC Magazine but Windows is a little dis...
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.040]   You know my biggest problem with Windows is it's unpredictable and maybe it's because
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:17.960]   I don't use it as much as I use Mac and Linux but I just things disappear.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.720]   Things close.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.320]   Things don't happen that you expect to have happen.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.960]   I've been editing a lot of stories about Windows 11 and one of our biggest reads has
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.680]   been 10 things I hate about Windows 11.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.600]   Everybody wants to hate on it.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.760]   Yeah you're right though.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.240]   I mean there's a lot of things that are just unpredictable.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   They change.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.240]   Why did they change it?
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.440]   There doesn't seem to be a reason.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.320]   My other big pet peeve with Microsoft is they changed the name of something.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.120]   So just as all the journalists have written the help articles about how to find this feature
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.200]   how to use it.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.120]   They changed the name and now you don't know what you're looking for anymore when you go
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.400]   to find help for it.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.200]   You have to tune into Windows weekly because Paul Thorett and Mary Jofoli are tearing their
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:07.200]   hair out all the time about this or then they use one name for 20 things like Outlook.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.640]   Outlook is a bunch of different things and when somebody says Outlook you have to say
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.280]   well do you mean the application that comes with Office?
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.080]   Do you mean Outlook.com?
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.200]   Do you mean it's all these different possibilities?
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:25.600]   Yeah and I give Apple a lot of credit with Mac OS.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:31.840]   It's not Windows is a little bit like having someone show up at your house while you're
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:38.200]   out at dinner and rearrange the living room and say you must now keep it in our arrangement.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   I don't think Apple does that quite as much as Microsoft does.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.520]   On Windows 11 I still can't move the taskbar over to the left where I want the taskbar to
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.520]   be.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.520]   It's setting.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.520]   No it's buried.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.520]   It's in there.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.520]   Can't be done.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.520]   I'm right the only.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.200]   Okay fine I'll do it.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.720]   I'll defend Windows.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:02.160]   I like it and I think Mac OS is annoying and Mac OS is the one when I have stuff disappear
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.520]   and I can't find my files and also I have to constantly updated to new versions and
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.760]   they never changes anything.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.160]   Like Mac OS in my user experience has not changed in like 10 years and also Windows 10
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   is great.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   There you go.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.160]   Oh right there you go.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   There you go.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.720]   But what about Windows 11 are you using that?
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   Hell no.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.480]   When does it sound a group of commonality here?
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.720]   I believe you have until 2025 before you're going to be forced to upgrade.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.960]   I'll go in the 12th all the way to the end.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.520]   I don't I'm going to my litany of complaints.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.840]   No operating system is perfect although Dan I'm with you I think Linux is as close as
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:45.280]   you can get at least no one's telling you what to do when you use it.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.040]   Let's see WWDC tomorrow we'll see iOS 16 previews.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.480]   We'll see Mac OS 13 watch OS 9.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.600]   It is possible they'll announce new air MacBook Airs.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:02.800]   I think some of the problem is supply chain when I ordered the Dell in April they said
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.280]   well I we think you'll get it in June.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:11.240]   Then they made it it was manufactured they said but because of the lockdown in Shanghai
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.600]   well we're not going to give you a tracking number until it gets to the United States.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:20.880]   They literally had no idea what was going to happen to it and I'm sure Apple as as much
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.240]   as they've been somewhat impervious to the supply chain issues.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:31.960]   I mean I just took a look at ordering a custom built a studio and that's 10 to 12 weeks
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.560]   off.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:38.160]   So there's still a big supply chain issue going on.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.880]   Well are you excited about iOS 16 Mac OS 13 watch OS 9.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.320]   Who would be who could be.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:51.160]   I recently got Chrome 100 I think and I went whoa let's have a party.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:56.640]   The days of remember windows when windows 95 came out and they had events all over the
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   country and then what was it windows 7 where they had have your own party they sent you
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:12.200]   could order balloons playing cards and invite your friends over for the new windows 7.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.120]   And the whole industry has lost that.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.560]   I think so is there anywhere in the industry where people are going oh my god this is the
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.440]   going to change everything.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:27.520]   Well games are still exciting to people who are in into games and there's a lot of people
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.360]   who are into games as their revenues would show.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:36.800]   There aren't I mean you Alex there aren't I mean it's not like there's a new genre.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.080]   It's like well you're going to shoot a gun what's a gun going to look like who's the person
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.840]   going to shoot look like otherwise it's the same game right Alex no wrong.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.600]   So you are correct that first person shooters remain very popular in different iterations.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.840]   I think games like apex legends have actually pushed the ball forward in terms of what that
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:59.640]   means but if you play games on a PC yes you are in the golden era of indie game development
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:04.200]   and also in the golden era of very complex management games and so if you don't.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.480]   Oh you love those I forgot you love those ridiculous games that are more like work than
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.800]   they are like play on a journalist and therefore I'm already a masochist so like bring it on.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.840]   No but games like ano 1800 which is all about supply chain management and so forth.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.480]   We live for a living.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.240]   That makes me just excited.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.720]   Whoa supply chain management.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:35.520]   Actually you know what I am 600 hours into Valheim which is an indie game that is really
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.480]   quite fun and has a lot of building and stuff so I'm with you.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.480]   There's some really interesting stuff being done.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:47.480]   But we are at peak technology in almost every area frankly.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   Let's face it.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.600]   Let's take another quick break.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.640]   We've got court action coming up next on Twitter.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.280]   Really great to have Alex Wilhelm here tech crunch plu that's a mccaller from now on.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.480]   Of you don't mind.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.120]   Would it matter if I did.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:09.000]   I think we stopped I stopped getting people from Bloomberg business week because I insisted
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.920]   on calling it Bloomberg business week.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:16.520]   So I won't I'll be nice I'll be nice because I want you to keep coming back.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.680]   Jill Duffy it's great to have you back it's been way way too long PC magazine.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.560]   So nice to see you and of course from the Walter Cronkite school.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.600]   Okay it's Dan Gilmore.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   That's the way it is.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.520]   We are going to take a little break come back with lots more of our ex.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.720]   You sounded like Nixon.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   Sorry.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.200]   I did I'm sorry my Cronkite turns into Nixon I'm working on it.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.640]   It was all the smoking back then I think.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.920]   I'll be back in just a second I showed today brought to you by podium.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.560]   I love podium.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:57.160]   In fact a lot of our small businesses around town have started to use podium.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.320]   You know if you own a small business the last few years have been I believe me I know
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.880]   tough really tough supply chain issues.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:08.040]   You can't get the stuff and then all of a sudden the demand is up and if you could get
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.680]   it you could sell it but you can't get it and on top of anything everything else you're
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:17.080]   trying to manage the businesses that are thriving right now are the ones who are a little more
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:23.480]   forward thinking and that means using text messaging using podium.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.440]   Potium helps your small business stay ahead of the curve with modern messaging tools that
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.720]   your customers actually want.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:36.360]   It makes it easier for them to connect with your business and a lot of people these days
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.960]   for instance don't like to call.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.960]   I mean are you one of those I don't want to call but what the pandemic taught us is
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:50.800]   hey we can text businesses they can text us back say your order is on the way.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.800]   If you want to get a bid I did this the other day it was incredible a window broke at our
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:00.080]   house I texted instead of calling because I want to call 20 different window repair
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.960]   people glaziers they call themselves so I text them and you know who got the job the
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:08.240]   first one texted back probably using podium right.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.960]   A hundred thousand businesses from health care providers to plumbers are texting with
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.720]   customers through podium.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.280]   Customers love the convenience businesses love the results podiums giving businesses
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:25.560]   the tools they need to compete with the convenience offered by Amazon how do you compete as a
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:33.000]   small business with Amazon personal service podium it's really that simple Dennis to send
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.960]   out payment requests he was you know he was you know I said so often happens a lot of
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:42.200]   people forgot to pay they hadn't paid he decided to send it out texts 70% of the outstanding
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.880]   collections got collected in two weeks just like that because you know people open texts
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.200]   they respond to texts it's more personal it's more direct it's faster.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:57.600]   You can ask people to leave a review for you you can sell things a truck dealer sold a
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:03.760]   $50,000 truck and four text messages the negotiations are faster easy customers happy
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.640]   you're happy with podiums all in one inbox you can do a lot more than just chat with
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:13.920]   people you can ask for reviews if somebody leaves the store you say how was your experience
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.040]   leave us a review on Yelp or Google wherever you like your reviews and I have to tell you
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.640]   when a customer gets that and you're fresh in their mind they respond more quickly they
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:28.000]   leave you a more accurate review you can collect payments fast from anywhere you can do marketing
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.200]   campaigns the ice cream parlor downtown I went there a couple of times gave my phone
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.160]   number now every three three four weeks I get a text saying hey we miss you we got a
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.640]   special ice cream right now that's the last thing I need but it really works it really
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:50.240]   does and it's all in a text message it's quick it's fast it's better for you your employees

[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:15.160]   now let's get back to the show back we are with our esteemed panel as we take a look
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.440]   at the week's news you might notice there's a slight difference up in the way this show
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:27.040]   looks and sounds that's because we had a calamity at the at the factory I think the entire supply
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:33.360]   chain collapsed Alex maybe we can bring you in you can solve our supply chain walls we
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:39.840]   had a power outage overnight and not everything came back as it should have even though with
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.280]   all the people in the world I'm least qualified to help with your IT setup no one is I got
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:48.440]   all the engineers going I don't know is that we rebooted everything everything lights are
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:53.480]   coming on but nothing's happening so I'm doing this from home we're using a zoom thank thank
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:58.920]   God zoom has guns when I first started to it we use Skype with four people and I would
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:06.800]   spend hours after the show fixing audio and this is I think actually pretty good and everybody's
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   used to zooming now right Jill's written a book about it actually what is it called
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:18.560]   I gotta say before the everything guide to remote work wherever you buy physical books
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.920]   and ebooks I gotta say you know I am really really proud of this book and it it is truly
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.040]   a guide where you can pick it up and flip to the chapter that you need so if you're like
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.520]   I'm having a bad day and I need to shake up my work from home routine like what can I
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.440]   do differently in my environment what can I do differently with how I communicate and
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:41.480]   collaborate with people or I'm a manager and I need to figure out what are some tricks
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:47.400]   to like get my team to be cohesive again pick it up flip to what you want I have these really
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:53.600]   fun little tabs that are birds if you can see those that's cool yeah yeah little little
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.800]   page tags that doesn't come with the book right that's a purchase now you've got to go get
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:03.320]   those from a fancy Japanese paper store very I love that I'm always looking for good book
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:08.760]   marks that's pretty retro isn't it but three out of four panelists today have bookshelves
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:14.440]   behind them so I guess I guess we are a retro bunch maybe I should have purchased your book
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:20.360]   before this calamity I would I'm still trying to figure out how zoom works yeah so back to
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:25.240]   zoom I wrote about zoom you know it was really like this darling of the tech industry and
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:30.560]   a lot of remote companies before anybody else had really heard of it and picked it up and
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.280]   I came to PC Mag and I was like you guys we really need a review of zoom it's gonna be
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:42.840]   a big thing this was probably 2017 2018 and I had I knew a little bit about the company
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.920]   and that the real point of differentiation was from the very beginning they said let's
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:52.880]   not think too much about features and bells and whistles let's focus on getting the back
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:57.840]   and technology good so it's stable because at that point in time there were so many
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:03.760]   video conferencing solutions and the problem with all of them was they were so glitchy and
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:10.560]   so I think if you compare it then at that point in time 2015 2016 to everything else
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.520]   that was available it was just so much more stable and I think that's what really sold
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:21.600]   it when people realized we need to have meetings online a lot more we can't have something
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.240]   that's just gonna crap out all the time that really answers a question I don't know if
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:34.360]   we ever got an answer to why during the pandemic zoom took off and FaceTime and duo and Skype
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:40.800]   and all and Microsoft teams why did they couldn't they capitalize do you think it was just simply
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:46.720]   quality I think a lot of it really was the quality and also that out of the gate they
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:52.680]   had a very generous free offering for a long time so it's no longer this way but when when
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:58.600]   the pandemic hit 40 minutes zoom calls because people don't pay for it so they go although
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:04.280]   isn't that brilliant if you have a multi-person call 40 minutes it's a limit like that's great
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:08.760]   but at the time you could have a one-on-one call that could be as long as you want it so
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:12.680]   no restrictions on that a lot of people relied on that and used it because it was just more
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:20.200]   stable than anything else it was a lifesaver I mean you know if we hadn't had zoom life
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.120]   would have been a lot harder and the company is not without its controversy you know there
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:28.920]   was a big problem with zoom bombing which you know I have to say I think I got it wrong
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.000]   in the beginning when I heard about that I said well people really need to be educated
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.360]   and turned on on the correct features to prevent people from getting in and that was the wrong
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   take the company really needs to make sure that it's taking proactive measures for people
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.560]   to have the protections that they need to keep their meetings secure from the beginning
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:51.760]   and for me that was a good sort of thought process to go through to think about what
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:57.000]   is the company's responsibility to you as a consumer and then some other things they
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.800]   got wrong to where they they announced that they were gonna charge people for one thing
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.880]   and not another and what was going to be encrypted and what wasn't so they've been through the
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:12.680]   ringer a bit and that's good you know the more people use the tool the more emphasis
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:18.320]   and light you shine on to their user agreements and their policies and their procedures and
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:24.600]   the more it really pushes the company to get it right we I mean there was a lot of discussion
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:30.760]   on our network especially in the security shows about their lack of end-to-end encryption
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.160]   that you know they said it's end-to-end encrypted but it wasn't they were very aggressive about
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:41.640]   hiring contractors and staff but they hired good people they acquired key base which is
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   a really good encryption firm and some very good engineers there so obviously they were
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.120]   smart they took the money that they their windfall profits from the pandemic and they
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:56.320]   put them in I think in the right places and at this point you know we use Skype for most
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:02.080]   of Twitt's life we switched to zoom about a year ago and at this point there is nothing
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.440]   that comes even close in fact thank goodness we did because we can we actually have a show
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:13.040]   today we might not if we hadn't had zoom Leo you lost reason I still had Skype on any
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:17.720]   computer so thank you know I apologize to all of you who are forced to keep Skype on
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:23.720]   your computer so you can do it I am so sorry you can now erase it you know I mean it anymore
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:30.720]   yeah my machine breathed a big sigh of relief when I'm not installed it it was the Google
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.560]   the Google product what I don't know they keep changing names of well there is a big
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:39.200]   change Google meet I think was what it's called now that's right that's become pretty
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:47.040]   good use it and for business meetings for safety stuff like that I'm on a major mass
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:56.680]   project that where people are using that and I I'm still in many ways prefer zoom but it's
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:03.240]   it did force the big companies to pay attention instead of saying well it's just one more feature
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:10.880]   you can use or not use they they did upgrade it a lot I I like zoom partly because it's
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:17.800]   not Microsoft or Google or Facebook or Apple I want to keep supporting stuff that's not
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:22.760]   one of the big ones I am starting to feel some zoom fatigues so that is a real that is
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:27.160]   definitely a real thing for being forced to look it's funny when I'm in a studio it's
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:32.160]   not quite the same but when you're on the call you kind of be forced to look at people
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:38.240]   and stuff like that it's an interesting shift actually there is a meeting is in the news
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:46.320]   Google meet because Google is unbelievably although by now we should expect this once
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.520]   again changing their messaging strategy they have a product which I have used which is
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:56.600]   much like FaceTime or zoom or Skype it's a called duo I use it with my daughter who
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:00.400]   has an Android phone works great has a lot of interesting features the others don't
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:06.160]   have they've announced that they're gonna merge duo and meet so that everybody will
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:13.720]   be confused and nobody will be happy I guess in theory it could be an improvement to meet
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:20.040]   because of the core technology of duo which is very very very good for video you use the
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.880]   expression Google messaging strategy I think
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:28.240]   I don't think there is such a thing
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:34.800]   Google messaging chaos is what it really feels like all messaging chaos yeah so get
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:41.720]   ready if you're using meet it's on it's kind of unclear to me but it sounds like Google's
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:48.760]   going to I don't know what they're merged duo into it they're eventually phasing out
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:57.120]   the name duo but phasing meat into duo so really meet with be duo with me feet and this
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:02.400]   is I mean the same thing just happened with Google chat and Google message
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:10.960]   Google voice Google hang out me and it's like they hired somebody from Microsoft to handle
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:17.680]   their name no oh no but going back to the Cheryl Sandberg conversation when when when
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:26.200]   Paige and Bryn left and and Eric left Google did start to turn into this kind of less well
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:32.360]   run and Sundar Pichai as not I don't think been a very good CEO we've talked about the
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:37.960]   business and the show before I'm sure he's technically good but the leadership there's
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:45.280]   a I think a leadership void at at alphabet I guess I should call it alphabet and and the
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.560]   problem is they get away with it because they make and this is going to be the same
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:53.600]   problem Facebook so much money you're nodding Alex on advertising right yeah but I mean
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.920]   at the same same problem comes up though we talked about the crappification of social
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.560]   networks earlier and how Instagram has been essentially been being forced to take on more
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:06.040]   and more of the revenue growth at Facebook Google searches a mess yeah Google searches
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:13.760]   a hot mess it's getting more like Instagram it's good like my search for a term most the
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.920]   time I want the Wikipedia page and now on mobile I have to scroll through like blocks
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:23.600]   of suggested alternative searches like like screw you Google I literally knew what I typed
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:28.360]   thanks and then there's ads and then there's so much more it's exponcer content it's just
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:33.640]   miserable and they're just ringing that rag because nothing else they've ever done makes
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:37.440]   money and I'm just gonna go back to what Jill said about Microsoft at least they have more
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:43.160]   than one business line you know Apple has iPhone Facebook has human misery Google has
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:47.920]   not results at least Microsoft sells more than one thing now company has problems to be clear
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:51.840]   but at least they can do more than one thing yeah remember you know what you're saying about
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:57.760]   Google I think another issue that a lot of us as journalists and writers know from the
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:05.320]   back end is that Google changes how it surfaces information all the time and it you know I
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:10.280]   think so many online publications have just come to rely on Google so much for feeding
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:16.800]   their traffic and it is impossible to know how these changes come about when they take
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.640]   place when they're being rolled out how do you make your content optimize it's it's really
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:28.000]   hard and it doesn't seem like a good long term solution for people to get information
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.560]   it's just seems like it's getting worse we gotta solve that because I mean doesn't isn't
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:40.040]   that the whole thing I mean this if the internet didn't have Google I don't know if we'd have
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:47.080]   an internet yeah what Dan said about platforms being a bing well bing is big is fine it's
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:50.920]   not amazing that's the same problems that Google this but Dan was talking earlier about
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.800]   getting off platforms controlling your own media and going back to the era of blogging
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.680]   that brings the source of information back to an individual versus Google's magical algorithm
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:05.120]   and it would you know if that did ever happen you know I don't want to dream about something
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.040]   that might be get crushed but like at least you would remove some of the dominance from
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:12.560]   Google's prominence and information centrality which is a really boring way of saying that
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.360]   sorry I couldn't show that simpler but you can't find those blogs without Google unless
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:20.120]   we bring back I don't know blogarati or whatever it was techno rati and techno rati if they're
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:25.920]   not right we have to have blog search again one thing that is coming back Twitter seems
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:33.320]   to I wrote so way back when I think this must have been 2009 or 10 Twitter took how
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.880]   to feature it was great called tracker it was kind of like a Google alert where you
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:43.040]   could say I want to see any tweets about a certain subject it was hugely valuable and
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:51.520]   I remember very well something they called bear hug camp I think your brother was involved
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:58.320]   in this stand actually where we were trying to get Twitter to bring back tracker they
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.560]   never did except they just it's I don't know if it's a rumor or announcement they're
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:10.680]   going to bring back basically search indexing search terms alerts tracker so maybe Twitter
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:17.480]   is the hope for all well you can you can do a lot of that with keyword searches now and
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:24.640]   you can you can this was a this would alert you so like if you wanted to be alerted when
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:31.920]   something happened it was a very useful tool yeah that that yes that I didn't I don't even
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:38.880]   remember that nobody else yeah it's way and the dim dark ages of blogs and podcasts oh
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:44.680]   so speaking of I said we were going to talk about the courts this I'll see if I can make
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:51.920]   my way through this without completely confusing myself Florida and Texas both passed social
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   media laws that attempt to force large social media companies not well basically not the
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   censor Donald Trump let's face it that's really what it was but but they couldn't say that
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:15.840]   so not to censor conservative they couldn't say that so not to censor but it of course
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.400]   is a pretty clear violation of the first amendment which says government shall make no law abridging
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:25.680]   speech and that speech if you say I don't want that on my on my Twitter feed or I don't
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:37.200]   want that I'm on Facebook that speech so weirdly the Texas law what the course there was an
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.280]   immediate attempt for request for injective relief by social networks who said wait a
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.760]   minute wait a minute you know you can't make that the law yet let's let's let's sue so
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.360]   they sued and they said they asked the judge okay look stop the law the judge said yes
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:55.600]   up then the state of Texas appeals to the Fifth Circuit which says no that's a good law
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:03.160]   and they said okay we're waiting that's currently the state it's legal and text no wait a minute
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:09.160]   no no no because then they appealed again in the Supreme Court and by the way I thought
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.640]   this would not happen because Justice Alito is the guy who manages the shadow docket for
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:19.720]   the Fifth Circuit so I thought Alito would just say no but no in fact weirdly the Supreme
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:26.360]   Court actually voted on this they didn't put out a decision there was a dissent from some
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:33.280]   of the justices so it's now blocked the Florida bill also blocked by a lower court by the
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.680]   11th Circuit that has not yet been appealed to the Supreme Court so as it stands neither
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:46.720]   one of these weird laws are in effect although court cases will continue in both cases did
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.720]   I get that right?
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.400]   Of course I do.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:58.120]   You did and the Supreme Court semi decision you can't call it since this is going to
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:07.000]   come back in a appeal again about the actual law as opposed to the injunction what fascinated
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.120]   me was that the vote there was five to four yes and and who was on the dissent and who
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.200]   was on the affirm.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:22.920]   I'm assuming because again it was really about whether an injunction was timely or whether
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:34.080]   this thing should be let stand for now that I'm assuming that most of the ones who dissented
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:41.640]   will actually vote that it's unconstitutional when it gets back with that being the issue
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:46.560]   because Kagan was one of the ones who said now let it ride for now and that's baffled
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560]   me.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:52.320]   She was the lone liberal you would expect but but but Justice Roberts and and I think
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:04:02.040]   it was a Kavanaugh and Barrett they're voted to to uphold the to reverse the lower the
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:08.560]   fifth circuit's decision and to block the law right Hagan voted to allow it.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:18.600]   Well I think I think perhaps I don't know you can't read their minds but the it seems
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:25.800]   likely to me that this will be fairly resoundingly found unconstitutional when it gets back but
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:33.840]   we have a Supreme Court now that's becoming more and more visibly a tool of the Republican
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:42.120]   Party and that is somewhat alarming because the Republican Party is clearly not that interested
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:49.840]   in free speech per se it's interested in free speech for people it agrees with and who agree
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:59.160]   and are part of an agenda and the there are several justices who would vote to overturn
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:07.200]   one of the most important cases ever the Brandenburg case that would that requires malice when
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:15.200]   talking about a public figure as a standard for libel and that's that's really dangerous
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.320]   but this is things are changing faster than we all seem to be paying enough attention
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.320]   to.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:28.200]   Yeah it seems the first amendment would protect these social networks somebody pointed out
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:38.000]   that if this I think Mike Masnick on Techter pointed out if this Texas law had stood for
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   instance twitch might not have been able to pull down the Buffalo shooters live stream
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.040]   and and if it did it would risk lawsuit because that's what the law establishes is the right
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.040]   suit.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:58.640]   Well the Texas law did have very quite a laundry list of carve outs that I think that Amazon
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:04.880]   would have been totally fine pulling that down even if that law had been found constitutional
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.800]   okay so I mean it's still.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:13.960]   Nobody wants that to be you know it's it's still a bad law but right.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:22.280]   When you read it you see that it wasn't done completely without thought just mostly perhaps
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   without thought.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.320]   Yeah it's like giving someone like half the anti-subject they need before they cut off
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.320]   their legs.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:31.680]   Like I mean an effort good job you're something a gang green and die.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.320]   I think it's ridiculous that we're at the point when we're arguing that the government
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.800]   should force private actors to carry speech and disseminate it.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:44.080]   Like how did we end up in this frickin sorry I'm not swearing on to it takes so much effort
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.920]   it's just like this like whole soul.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.920]   Well I hate to say it but I can't bleep you right now so have at it.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:54.800]   No I I think the people who produce to it do not deserve me to make their life.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.920]   I'm just gonna have to work harder.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.640]   No I I've met them I love those guys.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.480]   I just can't believe we're here it's like I'm living in cartoon land or upside down we're
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.080]   like what the hell is this.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.600]   This is just essentially two different governors each gunning for the future a top of political
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:15.720]   party that is neo-fascist arguing about how they should be given more power over corporations
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.120]   to determine what is speech.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.280]   It's really performative I think both Abbott and DeSantis are smart enough to know that
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:25.600]   it doesn't stand the sniff test for the first amendment but it's certainly a performative
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:31.680]   and it certainly establishes their bona fides in terms of protecting conservative speech
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.680]   right.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.440]   It also has their bona fides and my brain is morons like I mean I'm not interested in
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.640]   performative governance.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   Call me a technical.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:43.600]   I'm gonna get more emails from people who say you never let conservative people on the
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.400]   show.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:52.800]   Alex is just a crazy liberal lefty at a at a Rhode Island which is a hotbed of crazy liberal
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.800]   lefties.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:58.200]   I we weren't using the word conservative to describe extremists.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:03.680]   Okay I'm outgrained.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.000]   It's a common misnomer at this point we all use it as I think it's wrong.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.520]   It's protective cover for them.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.520]   Because they're the opposite of conservative.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.520]   Yes.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.840]   They're neo-fascist and essentially monarchists they want to give Donald Trump the country
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.400]   and let him sit there and hold on to it because they don't actually believe in democracy.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.040]   And to me that's disgusting and anti-American and should be called out as such and if you
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:28.120]   want to find someone who will come and argue the first amendment does allow the government
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.840]   to compel corporations to cover speech they don't agree with it don't want to disseminate.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.200]   Bring them on.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.560]   Good luck finding that person who's serious.
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.160]   Well Elon might come on.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.960]   Elon.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.880]   Twitter said on Friday this is going to be our brief mention of Elon we've been trying
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.600]   to we've been trying to we're on an Elon diet.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.520]   Twitter said on Friday sorry I didn't see you drinking I wouldn't have said that.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:00.800]   And on Friday the waiting period under the heart I love saying it heart Scott Rodino
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:11.160]   anti trust improvements act has expired which means Elon where's your check for 44 billion.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:16.000]   Now I guess Twitter's next step is to go to the shareholders and say do you want to get
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.240]   5420 for this stock that's selling at $38.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.480]   Alex why is Twitter stock so low?
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.440]   Should it be closer to 5420?
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.480]   The gap between the proposed deal price and the current sharp rice just shows the markets
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:35.200]   lack of belief that it will get closed at that level.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:40.440]   He has been again editing crap posting all over Twitter about the deal the company the
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:45.040]   management it's user base and so forth are there in an attempt to break up with the company
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.280]   and get out of the deal and there's legal issues there and some fines and so forth.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.720]   You may not be able to well it's not just the one billion dollar.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.720]   Break up fee.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.000]   Break up fee.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.880]   He may be compelled he signed it's like you said I'm going to buy a car you know you
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.680]   sign on the dotted line you can't decide not to or he's trying to lower the price and that
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:09.000]   seems to be what investors are betting on but I don't think Twitter Twitter doesn't
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.880]   forget Twitter didn't want to sell yeah they adopted a poison pill defense to dilute ownership
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.440]   to avoid this right then they got kind of bullied into it and now the guy who bullied
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.560]   them is walking away because he's a coward weird.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.840]   I think it was a bluff from the start I really do think it was a bluff from the start and
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:34.960]   if you look at anybody else who is a high powered bleepity bleep the next step is to
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:39.000]   litigate right like that's how you get out of it is you you threaten a lawsuit you bring
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.120]   a lawsuit you you settle a lawsuit.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.440]   You settle a lawsuit exactly.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:53.120]   Elon has done things which are not good for Tesla to raise the money he's been actively
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.480]   kind of trying to get the money together if he didn't mean to buy it I don't know would
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.640]   he be doing that.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.000]   You probably thought that he could leverage Tesla stock forever that it would continue
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:13.400]   to go up in well in its Tesla stock price has been insane yeah and not in the crazy
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:21.800]   Eddie sense but I mean in the ridiculous sense for a really long time right.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:30.560]   Twitter is now $40 as we record this so that's a $12 what is it you know $14.20 differential
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:34.360]   that's a pretty significant differential if you thought he was going to be forced to
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.560]   sell it or buy it at 5420 it might be a good buy right.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:44.120]   Can we also kill off the annoying thing about putting meme numbers into deal values like
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:49.800]   $4.20 like I mean yeah that's so yeah sense to like like like are we run by children that
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.400]   confirms Jill's theory that he didn't mean it because why would you bid something 54
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:01.680]   to you know I think there's there's people who have a lot of power and not a lot of clarity
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.960]   of thought anymore who don't always know that they are bluffing right like there's a moment
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.760]   at which you believe what you're saying right but you don't really think you're going to
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.760]   be held to it and when you're called out on it you double down but you still know you
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:23.760]   have all this money and a galley of lawyers to back you up to help you get out of it in
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:29.600]   the end and you know I'm not saying people do this with the conscious thought but you
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:35.960]   see it happen a whole lot I just I started watching the we work documentary with Jared
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:46.640]   Leto and excuse me and half away and Jared Leto is embodying Adam Newman's absolute faith
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:53.480]   and and willingness to lie up and down but believe it because his fundamental faith is
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:13:00.080]   if you believe it hard enough it will happen and I'm sure Elon Musk has that same mentality
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:08.240]   a lot of startup founders do right yeah well I I think we've all known founders who acted
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:16.960]   like you know Dorothy and Oz trying to get home and just you know if you believe it it'll
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:25.560]   happen is is is faith and we we don't it's really tough because we in in this business
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:34.200]   that we're all so steeped in a lot of things have happened because people didn't give up
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:41.480]   when it made no sense to continue examples yeah but I think we've also and I'm I fault
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:48.400]   myself on this considerably I think I've I've tended to give people cut people slack at times
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:55.320]   when I should not have when I've said well it could maybe it could happen when it was
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:01.800]   sort of observably ridiculous from the start and the whole tech journalism industry basically
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:09.120]   got taken in more than once by false yeah we're complicit we try not to be I think we
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:17.320]   all try not to be we all try to be hard headed but I don't know I I kind of want it to work
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:23.040]   I'm kind of I think this would be cool if the metaverse existed or you know if we all
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.560]   are in self-driving vehicles and we suppose we forget there's some barriers some real
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.560]   technical barriers to that Tesla is actually pausing all hiring worldwide they're going
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:41.320]   to cut 10% of their staff amid Elon's memo you like did not buy your book Jill you ones
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:48.680]   memo saying if you want to work here you're gonna come back to the office I'm sure you
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:58.200]   read that Jill yeah minimum 40 hours a week in an office minimum yeah wow this is less
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.800]   than we ask of factory workers and then he sent another email because I guess people I
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.760]   don't know maybe thought people weren't taking him seriously the more senior where you are
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.960]   the more visible must be your presence that's why I lived in the factory so much I thought
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:15.920]   it was to annoy the workers what did I know so that those on the line could see me working
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.640]   alongside them I saw I've seen posts from a number of anonymous Tesla engineers who said
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:26.640]   yeah he was there he has no engineering expertise so he was just micromanaging us and making
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:33.440]   it harder to get our job done so thank you Elon he said if I hadn't done that Tesla would
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.800]   long ago have been bankrupt now maybe I should bring in the most he certainly knows how to
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.520]   get some some spotlight on them right like yeah say something that's controversial say
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:48.160]   it loudly make a big bluster over it that's how you get people to pay attention even if
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:54.160]   you're wrong I mean isn't this wrong with what isn't this what's wrong with social media
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.360]   is is that's that's the way to get the attention that's the way to get the clicks and the views
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:05.400]   and the YouTube plays and the follows right it really is and it's your card action you
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:12.640]   don't have to do anything important you just have to be on TV and say something say something
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:20.640]   that people don't like right yeah he's got some I mean genuine amazing accomplishments
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:27.240]   to his to his record and I don't want to dismiss those I mean the we would not be as far as we
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:36.280]   are in electrification of automobiles and vehicles as we as as we are today we would not be there
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:44.040]   had it not been for Tesla we would we would get there and on space travel I'm you know
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:53.680]   hats off to SpaceX although so much of SpaceX has been funded by us taxpayers that is a
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:17:00.400]   good business to genius entrepreneurship but hey back those loans and and and and Tesla
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:06.720]   gets the benefit of enormous tax breaks for its customers etc etc having said that I'm
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:13.840]   still I'm having to separate the admiration I have for for the vision that's on level
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:20.120]   and and the fortitude to push through trouble and to make things actually happen with a
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:27.600]   great team and all of the BS and the the some of the vile stuff that he represents that
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:33.360]   really bothers me a lot and I I come out on the sort of well I admire the accomplishments
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:42.320]   but really really can't stand the person as as a leader of people I drove a Tesla I was
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.720]   very happy to drive a Tesla I really did what you know and I still drive electric vehicles
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:53.360]   we all do in our family I know I've also read articles from people who say you know a lot
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.400]   of its bluster he certainly for the last seven years been telling us we'd have self-driving
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:07.280]   vehicles next year I don't know if that's ever ever gonna happen SpaceX yeah pretty impressive
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:14.800]   thanks thanks to a lot of government money but still they're doing okay and and now I'm
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.640]   starting to see some Starlink dissatisfaction as they raise the prices and the quality seems
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.840]   to be deteriorating so he likes to promise go ahead Alex I could tell you want to say
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.080]   some I just want to go back to the whole working from the office thing forget I mean Dan did
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.800]   a good job going over the accomplishments in the country versus the credit yeah I used
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:38.680]   to work 50/50 between a home office on the East Coast and an office and on the West Coast
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.480]   I would just fly back and forth and so I had infinite natural experiments between the
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.960]   two working environments same job just different places I would do work for two weeks and then
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:52.200]   I would fly to the office for two weeks to be annoyed by people who talked to me at the
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:57.160]   competition and like I'm just perplexed by this idea that we want to go for lunch today
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:04.200]   Alex I mean you joke but yes and just walking like the time spent commuting and the executive
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.840]   function of my brain that I had to waste just getting around San Francisco love the city
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.120]   by the way to me this is just insane it's handy that people are saying you you're less
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:15.920]   productive I do understand that certain jobs will have a higher office component sales
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.360]   teams people who build stuff sure but for most of us who go to an office sit down and put
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.280]   on headphones what are you doing and so I'm just for someone who's theoretically so visionary
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.080]   and when we're all working from home right now aren't we even me we're working from home
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:37.240]   on a Sunday on a Sunday yeah thank you you guys are great Jill Duffy Alex Wilhelm it's
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:43.480]   great to have you Dan Gilmore we're gonna take a little break come back and lots more
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:49.280]   to talk about on Twitter hey before we go on I want to show you my new jacket wait a minute

[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:12.880]   not here because I have COVID I'm here because the studio fell apart basically overnight and
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.560]   so but you know what in a way this is kind of I like this this is more like us just sitting
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:21.920]   around talking this is how Twit started way back in the day and I'm really glad you're
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.000]   here Jill Duffy we're going to talk about the 40th anniversary of PC magazine in just
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.320]   a little bit that's amazing Dan Gilmore who's of course the Dean of Journalism so he's
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:40.720]   going to be our conscience today for and and of course I've known Dan for years since
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:47.320]   the San Jose Mercury News Alex Wilhelm also dear friend from Tech Crunch please New York
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:53.920]   State passes I thought this I was stunned to see this headline first ever right to repair
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:59.480]   law I thought there were dozens of states working on right to repair laws I remember
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:04.800]   talking about how Apple was going to one state government somewhere in the Midwest saying
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:09.320]   oh you can't let people repair their stuff I thought for sure we'd have a right to repair
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.880]   law there's the right to repair dot org Kyle Wiens and I fix this is website that to push
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:23.160]   this and yet this is it the first actual right to repair law I guess what the upshot is if
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:29.640]   you do it in New York they're big enough that probably every company would have to respond
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:36.880]   right New York says all manufacturers who sell digital electronic products in the state
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:45.520]   of New York will have to make tools and manuals instructions available parts to for people
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:51.040]   consumers and independent shops that want to repair their stuff the measure won't take
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:58.280]   effect for another year so once the governor Hockill signs it it'll be a year but I fix
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:06.360]   it said it's one giant leap for repair kind it's so important for environmentalism to
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:11.600]   yes you know we live in this in the society where we are really pushed to consume consume
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:18.640]   consume companies corporations have to grow grow grow like anybody who has an environmental
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:24.840]   conscience we'll see that that is not the right way to do anything and a better way is
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:29.360]   to have devices that last a long time that we can fix that we can repair that we can
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:35.040]   use those parts over and over again and this is just too long coming super happy to see
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:42.280]   it though yeah I'm still waiting for the governor to sign it before I break out in
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:50.640]   cheers and it's worth noting California blocked the same kind of law in the last few days
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:59.320]   due to the industry that wants to make sure that you don't own what you purchased that
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:06.040]   they continue to own what you're what you purchased is very effective at blocking common
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:12.040]   sense laws like this and increasingly this is this is evil that they're blocking these
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:18.560]   laws just evil I agree with that yeah President Biden issued an executive order asking the
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:25.600]   FTC to reinforce these repair rights I don't know how much teeth that had technically I
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.520]   should clarify that New York State's the first electronics law there are there have
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:37.480]   been previous laws of Massachusetts law focused on automobile data you have the right to repair
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:43.160]   your data I don't know and Colorado I'm reading the Verge's article the Colorado past a bill
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:48.880]   ensuring and this is wild the right to repair powered wheelchairs this was a big controversy
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:55.480]   because people were waiting months to get their only form of transportation fixed because
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:01.240]   the manufacturer said no no no we can't let you fix this it's the John Deere story in a
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:08.600]   different way John Deere refusing to let people fix their own tractors and the Massachusetts
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:16.520]   law I believe was it was about the diagnostic things we plugged into the OBD had to open
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:24.880]   that up so what did the make auto manufacturers do they made it mobile and wireless which negated
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:34.560]   the law there the listen industry and I remember this is led by Apple Apple is the primary company
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:41.240]   that runs around spending lots of money on lobbying and other things to prevent this kind
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:47.240]   of law from passing everyone else is in on it but Apple is the leader in blocking right
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:53.680]   to repair which is funny because I don't even understand that's they do now have a self-repair
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:01.160]   plan we we actually Mike a sergeant ordered a phone battery for his iPhone 12 he didn't
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:06.640]   need to repair but he wanted we wanted to test it got the 76 pounds the two big pelican
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:12.800]   cases they arrived the clock starts ticking the minute they arrive you have seven days
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:17.680]   to return or you have to pay thousands of dollars for the equipment the battery didn't
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.000]   come the battery income was shipped separately because I guess because it's lithium ion two
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:29.480]   hours before the seven day deadline they arrived Mike is calling Apple and it turns out Apple
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:34.160]   doesn't do this a company called spot is doing for Apple he calls spot they say no no extension
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:41.360]   you didn't get the battery not our problem send it back so we now have a battery and
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.800]   no way to repair it and then on top of all of that I mean apples you know it's it's malicious
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.040]   compliance they're they're adhering the letter of the law without actually giving you something
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.960]   you can use and on top of that the cost ends up being about the same as bringing it to an
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.720]   Apple store so and it's only for the latest iPhone SE iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 is not
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:08.600]   for the others so it's it's the way Microsoft vowed to comply in back in the old days when
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:13.240]   it was ordered to remove Internet Explorer from the operating system and they said fine
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:20.320]   we'll just disable the operating system because of course this is all hairball that you cannot
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:25.360]   remove one part of without destroying everything is I remember writing about that and saying
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:31.320]   this was compliance with a raised middle finger it's like paying a fine in pennies you know
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:38.480]   fifty thousand pennies this here's another I think good law Jill you might have something
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:44.280]   to say about this it's not passed in the US it's the province of Ontario has passed a
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:51.440]   right to disconnect a right to disconnect law as of June 2nd employers in Ontario with
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:57.320]   twenty five or more employees have to have a written policy on disconnecting outside
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:04.320]   business hours that means no work related communications no emails no telephone calls
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:11.560]   no video calls no sending a reviewing of messages no performance of work when you're off duty
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:17.640]   you wouldn't think you'd need a law to do that but you do yeah you know what's interesting
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:26.440]   about this is I think there's been a really strange shift generationally as younger people
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:30.560]   have come into the workforce this is before the pandemic there was a piece of research
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:36.080]   done that asked people about how much they wanted to be connected to their jobs when
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:42.520]   they were on vacation nights weekends whatever their time off was and younger people said
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:48.500]   I feel like I want to be connected so that I don't come back to panic and chaos and
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:54.080]   unexpected things I'm used to being connected to people I'm used to know what's going on
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:59.560]   and now I think there there's a caveat there which is to say younger people who are inexperienced
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:04.200]   and may have been led into believing you are so important to your company you're so valuable
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:09.440]   the company will love you back you know there might be a little bit of disillusionment there
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:15.200]   about what it means to be connected but they sort of had a very different understanding
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:20.760]   of why they wanted to still be connected in their time off and it didn't mean they wanted
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.000]   to be working it just they they didn't want to have any surprises come up while they were
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:31.720]   away and have this like you know very strange fear of missing out whereas older workers sort
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.440]   of said I don't want to be looking at email on the weekend I don't want to be getting
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.480]   text messages when I'm on vacation I want to be able to disconnect so I think you know
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:47.840]   on the one hand it is good for people to feel like they have some agency and some choice
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:54.160]   in how much they want to be connected with their employer but there is the problem that
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:59.320]   not everybody knows what that really means and they don't have the experience to understand
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:05.720]   why it could be problematic yeah well they will delegate with the Sheryl Sandberg burnout
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:11.720]   I hope our next is not leaning it's burned out or something like that I wouldn't there
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:16.800]   is definitely we talked about earlier this kind of notion the the notion of the founder
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:23.640]   and working 60 hours and you know losing your wife your kids your family life your regular
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:29.080]   life because you're building something that's going to change the world and I guess if you
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:35.240]   had stock options you might say I'm also you know building my future but otherwise really
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:39.200]   you're just building up the pocketbook of the guy who wants to come in you know in media
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:43.280]   we have layoffs every couple of years is just sort of like a routine thing that happens
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:49.400]   yeah I got laid off in my 20s and maybe it was the best thing that ever happened to me
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:55.120]   in terms of having a better understanding of what my self worth and my identity is and
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:01.320]   in connection with my job at the time it was awful I had to go through a grieving process
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:07.040]   it was really painful because I felt like I this was so important to me and I was really
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:12.960]   pouring my all and I wanted to be important to this publication that I worked on and with
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.680]   some years of hindsight it really it really was a big shift for me and I'm glad it happened
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:25.760]   I'm gonna take well I mean Leo doesn't know this yet but my spouse and I are well she's
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:31.120]   pregnant I'm just part of it congratulations we just we just said 12 weeks so I'm kind
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:36.720]   of league I can say it now yeah I can say it now I'm gonna try mister that's the best by
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:43.880]   the way well I'm just going to have more interest in eating food now that you can no
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:50.280]   I only right I bring it up though because I'm gonna take paternity leave mostly in Q1
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.000]   and you know my spouse asked me you know how much time can you take off and I said I don't
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.640]   know but I'm taking off a lot and she says what if they say no and I said well I'm la
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:07.320]   no more like more like eat excrement and expire like I'm not going to miss these months because
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:11.920]   of a job you don't have to say that yet they haven't said no yet no no I'm sure but she
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.600]   brought though you know that's the priority and that should be your priority it's crazy
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:22.120]   in this country that especially paternity leave is not the law of the land I mean every
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:29.000]   other civilized country gives you a lot of time off it's insane yeah I would like to
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.120]   very gently suggest parental leave other than per paternity leave well he'd be yeah parental
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:40.640]   yeah my point being that I think a lot of companies have a maternal leave policy and
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.440]   they don't have a putt journal leave policy I agree parental leave is is very important
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:49.280]   but sometimes fathers are left out of that equation they go well you didn't do anything
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.960]   combat the work what are you doing there you know taking care of the new life that just
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:58.800]   came into this earth and it's a little more important than writing oh I'm gonna do it I
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.040]   don't want to get in trouble hey hey let's not let's not diminish writing the day of the
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:10.000]   WWC Apple stock price story that's a good story it's a valuable story it's not it takes
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.880]   seven minutes it's it's fine you can do that in the way you can do that in the waiting
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:19.320]   room is Arrington listening to this the seven minutes is there any more he's long gone
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:26.760]   long gone Dan I can type really fast you know you talk about this civilized countries
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:32.000]   I mean when you put that in the context of the United States this is getting more and
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.200]   more of a problematic notion you know all kinds of ways not least of wish that we don't
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:42.840]   have health care for you have health care exactly you want entrepreneurship to explode
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:49.400]   and do really well and let people have health care that they can rely on and not fear bankruptcy
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:54.120]   that would but we don't do that we have a I have a first person example of that Renee
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.680]   Richie who worked for iMOR and a lot of other publications decided he wanted to start a
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:04.240]   YouTube channel and really focus on you know building his YouTube presence and brand as
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:10.200]   his own you know personal stuff and he could do it because he's Canadian and he said if
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:14.320]   I did if I were you know lost my health if I were in the United States lost my health
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:19.400]   care I couldn't do this but I can do it because I have a nationalized health care in Canada
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:24.720]   yeah and I'm not risking my my life in limb launching on my own and he's done very well
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:32.560]   which is which is great we should I should make this a regular segment a more bored a
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:40.720]   Biott Club's NFT stolen in the middle of the night on discord from PC magazine comes his
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:47.120]   story but it's unbelievable coin desk reports a hacker took control of the discord account
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:53.320]   of you go labs the creators of the board a Biott Club of his of the community manager
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:58.040]   Boris Wagner that compromised account then used to share fishing links it came from Boris
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:06.520]   it's got to be real to the official discord channels for BAYC and other side which yoga
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:12.280]   labs describes on its website as a gamified interoperable metaverse currently under development
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:22.400]   but this whole thing is so scammy all around coinbase said the hacker stole 145 ETH as
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:31.800]   well as the BAYC's NFT's the price of the ETH was a mere 1792 at the time of writing
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:38.600]   but six hundred eighteen thousand dollars wait a minute oh the price of ETH was 1792
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:42.600]   so the total was two hundred sixty thousand dollars in ETH three hundred fifty eight
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:50.840]   thousand dollars worth of NFT's unbelievable on April 25th the company's Instagram account
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:57.480]   was compromised to steal 2.8 million worth of NFT's the funny thing is this is probably
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:03.080]   good publicity for NFT's because at least they say they're worth something who's going
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:10.360]   to buy these stolen NFT's is there still a market I don't know just crazy this market
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:18.400]   is just an example of mass hypnosis and I just it blind it just blows my mind that this
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:24.520]   conversation can even be taking place but then again we live in a we live in a in a world
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:30.120]   now where people there people are buying into this stuff in cryptocurrency season are things
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:35.480]   partly because they have nothing left that they trust they're watching governments it's
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:41.140]   happening yes they're they're they're watching governments inflate their money and and take
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:47.200]   away value there they're watching all kinds of things go on where they say this is my
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:54.280]   only chance to put away something that I'm going to be able to have in the future that's
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:39:00.760]   not true but that's what they think and you know people who are desperate are the easiest
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:11.920]   marks of the con men and we're in a time of just endless cons and I'm really afraid of
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:16.480]   what could happen and the worst of it is that it's bad enough for the people who are getting
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:22.040]   suckered and I do feel sorry for them but I have a little less sympathy than they may
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:29.920]   want the problem I'm seeing is that in a lot of the stuff has been entwined with the real
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:38.880]   economy in various kinds of financial instruments and such that when this all fully collapses
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:45.000]   I think it may it could bring down a whole lot of stuff by extension that we don't want
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:53.800]   to bring down I'm very worried about how we're just letting these things go run wild without
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:40:01.560]   any serious law enforcement that I'm aware of yeah there is some stories of that there
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:06.040]   was some insight trading at OpenSea which is a probably the biggest NFT trading platform
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:11.920]   in the world and the the government's getting involved in kind of prosecuting that so I
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.360]   think I think I think that's the first question to say.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:24.760]   Insider trading action against the NFTs space I think it is it was it's Nate Chastain who
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:34.680]   was buying NFTs before they were public promoting them on the OpenSea marketplace you know and
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.720]   when you get promoted you know hey this is going to be a good one they tend to sell and
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.520]   then he would flip them so he was getting to choose which are featured and then he would
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:47.600]   flip them for two to five times what he paid and this is one of the things a lot of people
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:53.320]   think well this is all anonymous he thought well I'm using anonymous wallets and anonymous
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:41:00.960]   accounts but apparently it's not fully anonymous to the government so OpenSea did figure it
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:07.120]   out and fire him so he's working by the way in case you want to invest in a new NFT project
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:14.920]   O-FLE let's just use your chance and get in early because as you know on these things
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:24.920]   it's always good to be the first to buy not the last to buy let's see now we're getting
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:30.760]   down to the seeds and stems the dregs of the stories you guys we sent you a hundred stories
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:36.000]   and I apologize more than a hundred hundred and thirty stories let me see if there's anything
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.320]   else I really want to talk about before we take a quick break because I do want to kind
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:46.960]   of celebrate 40 years of PC magazine which is which is really great no I think we'll
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:52.280]   just take a break how about that I don't see anything of urgent if you if you see anything
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:58.520]   Dan or Alex or Jill that you want to talk about put a pin it and we'll get back to that
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:05.120]   in just a moment this episode of this week at Tech brought to you by Noreva Noreva is
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:10.680]   so great if you're going back to work but not everybody is and you've got your conference
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:14.400]   rooms some employees will be there in the conference room some employees will be at
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:18.920]   home and you don't want to disadvantage the people who aren't there you want them to be
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:23.280]   able to hear what's going on in that meeting and that's why you need Noreva sure you could
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:29.120]   go get a big AV company they'd install cameras lots of microphones lots of wires technicians
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.800]   coming in installers coming in and by the way those those special rooms they need to
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:39.040]   be constantly calibrated that means more technicians coming in and where you see the
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:45.440]   bill why do that when you could get great sound from Noreva this is the more modern way of
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:51.240]   doing it Noreva has patented the microphone missed technology so one sound bar if it's
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:56.360]   a really big room you could put two sound bars in very simple that's a speaker and their
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:01.920]   microphone missed technologies built in which literally puts well I guess it's figuratively
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.040]   because they're they're not really putting thousands of microphones in the room but it's
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:11.640]   like they are everybody in the room can be here clearly no matter where they're positioned
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:15.600]   no matter where they're facing the last people in the room to move comfortably to social
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:21.080]   distance great for classrooms where people need to separate by six feet or more it's
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.920]   so much simpler than a traditional system you can install it yourself just like a sound
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:31.640]   bar and thanks to continuous auto calibration your rooms are instantly and always ready
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:38.080]   with optimized audio nobody has to come in and and calibrated in fact Noreva will also
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:43.600]   give you a simplified console the Noreva console so your IT team can sit down the hall or across
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:51.920]   the country and coordinate control power manage and adjust all the rooms wirelessly over the
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:57.960]   internet it's a fantastic technology one or two integrated microphones and speaker bars
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:03.120]   fill a room with thousands of virtual microphones so there are no dead zones everyone can be
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:09.000]   heard meeting participants class participants just talk naturally move naturally in the
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.720]   space and your remote participants can hear they can participate they don't feel left
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:20.040]   out so everybody's working together as a team this is exactly how conference rooms should
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:25.520]   be designed 30 minute DIY job big savings on time and cost compared to those traditional
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:31.040]   systems I think you got to try it ask yourself do you want to go with a costly complicated
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:37.320]   traditional system or make the leap to something very modern simple economical Noreva it's
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:47.720]   N-U-R-E-V-A do yourself a favorite check this out Noreva.com N-U-R-E-V-A Noreva.com it is
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:53.320]   a revolution for conference rooms we had a great week thank you Noreva by the way we
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:58.480]   had a great week on Twitch with lots of good things and we've made a little mini movie
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:04.160]   for you to enjoy watch although I think all movies there we go there we go there we go
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:13.600]   let's see Jeff Jarvis now oh my that is that's that's the inner Jeff channeling you know this
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:21.520]   is so stupid this is so stupid god bless the internet folks God bless the internet previously
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:30.000]   on Twitter I am Antford and I want to share my quick thoughts on the Canon R5C the hybrid
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:37.120]   mirrorless camera this camera is mmm it is damn near perfect damn they're perfect it's
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:44.000]   just one or two things really just one big thing that bugs me the most on it tech news weekly
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:53.040]   we talk with the lawyer and the law knowledgeable Denise Howell about the Texas scotus ruling and
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:58.720]   we get a nice refresher on how the court systems in the United States actually work which I very
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:08.000]   much needed security now we're going to first examine the difficult to believe in 2022 design
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.680]   of Australia's new South Wales digital drivers license which was sold to the public as being
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:21.760]   quite difficult to counterfeit it's just you know some bureaucrats nephew designed that are
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:30.720]   something so bad twit.tv tell your friends pc magazine I never worked for pc magazine I read
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:36.720]   it religiously it was the king of the computer magazines back in the day I remember the the
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:43.120]   people who worked there and the editors there were gods I remember going to Comtex and Bill
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:50.400]   McCrone was like royalty coming in they used to have the big parties there was a lot of money
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:59.520]   I can't believe it's 40 years pc magazine yeah 19 19 oh I didn't write an article about it
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:03.520]   okay but we there's a big yeah there's a big celebration
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:12.560]   suite of content for the 40th anniversary so pc magazine as it was called then launched in
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:20.800]   1982 and in that first issue was an interview with Bill Gates so the current editor and chief
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:26.640]   just starting right I mean he wasn't really early really early out the current editor and
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:33.040]   chief went back and had an interview with him today 40 years later to see how he's thinking
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:39.920]   about things now and how the history of computing has shaped the world and what he's what he's up to
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:44.960]   what kind of gear he's using so that's a really fun article to read and there's some other great
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:53.040]   content for example a look back at 20 pcs that shaped the last 40 years of computing that's a fun
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:58.960]   one lots of fun little graphics in there and I know a lot of people are going to say oh the amigo
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:04.560]   is missing and this is missing it's a it does have a little frame on it this is like pc's that
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:13.040]   were covered by pc magazine but still a really fun read and there's a great piece of video too
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:18.800]   where a couple of the editors went back into a storage room and pulled out some of those old
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:24.640]   issues from the 80s and some of them were five and seven hundred pages long and they said you know
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:31.120]   why yeah why was this why were these issues so big and and and it had to do with advertising
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.560]   and not just that the advertising was was you know making money for the magazine but this is how
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:42.800]   people found out about where you could buy computing equipment and and add-ons for your personal
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:48.480]   computer because there was no internet there was no online marketplace at that time so you had to
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:53.760]   to get the shipping rate for a magazine for something to be officially called a magazine you had to
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:49:01.200]   have a ratio of editorial to advertise so the more ads that you sold the more editorial you have to
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:07.920]   mix in in order to get that magazine shipping rate and so that's this is why a lot of people
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:12.640]   don't know this about the history of print magazine but this is why so many magazines back in the day
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:19.440]   were so fat was you you needed to get that that ratio of advertorial advertising to editorial
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.200]   right and yet i think it's super computer shopper which had some editorial
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:28.880]   PC Zeta dif Davis who the owners of PC magazine spun that off probably was PC magazine got
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:34.000]   thicker and thicker they said we need an even bigger format it was a tabloid format magazine
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.520]   it was also inches thick but it did not have a lot of editorial maybe they didn't mail it
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:45.680]   or maybe they mailed it on a different rate because it was just basically it was you could
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:51.360]   have a lot of advertising you could i think i think it was like upwards of 60 70 percent
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:56.480]   could be advertising like it's a pretty high ratio they didn't have but those those laws still
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:02.160]   hold today too for print for anybody who works in print i came up in print so i definitely know
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:07.520]   those those days of looking at pages and actually like laying out the magazine on a table and
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:14.000]   this is actually having a word count limit to what you could write i'm looking at this you know the
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.240]   piece 20 most influential PCs i agree every one of them really a great read and what i didn't know
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:27.200]   is you've got every issue of PC magazine available on the site five hundred fifty issues so you can
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:34.320]   read really first one oh man that's and for people who don't know the history so the print
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:43.520]   magazine of PC magazine folded i think at the end of 2010 so it was roughly 30 years maybe 28 years
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:51.920]   of print magazine and now it goes by the name pcmag.com and and today you know every now and again i
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:58.080]   get an email from readers saying you don't do as much high level nerdy stuff as you used to do you
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:04.240]   don't talk about this really in-depth personal computing and the truth of the matter is we still
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:09.360]   do there is still a good amount of you know stories about building your own rigs or whatever but we
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:16.720]   we cover a lot more now because technology has changed and it really is for more people now and
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:22.000]   and the way that we use technology the way that it's integrated into our lives affects everyone so
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:29.280]   we try to approach it in a way that we can give advice buying advice for products and how to advice
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:35.520]   for using those products to be applicable to everybody so that anybody could read those articles
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:40.960]   and really understand what they need to understand yeah yeah i think that that's true i mean remember
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:47.040]   stereo magazines in the 50s i mean dan you remember it yeah i remember it i think he's young he's young
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:53.200]   not the not the 50s but i think but in the early days it was it was about you know you play the 1812
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:59.120]   overture because the cannons would really test the rms capacity of your amplifier and your
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:06.480]   and your big you know altic lansing speakers and then after a while it became more about content
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.720]   and less about the the speeds and fees and i think the same thing happened with the computer
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:15.280]   industry i'll a little story i i don't think i've ever told before when we first started doing
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:21.600]   twit 17 years ago we at first we weren't going to do ads but finally we decided all right we're
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:26.720]   gonna have to do an ad support a network because that's the only way we can go forward but nobody
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:33.760]   had set ad prices for podcasts at all so i i i've called pc magazine i said what do you charge for a
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:40.800]   full-page ad and i figured well we're not as we're not pc magazine but but also your ad isn't competing
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:46.320]   with a bunch of other ads you have to kind of listen to hear it so i found out what their price i cut
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:51.920]   about 40 bucks off cpm and that was that was how he established the price for podcast advertising
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:57.920]   and you know what it kind of held so it was as rule of as uh as cedar the pants as it was
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:08.320]   one of things about pc magazine and the things in that genre and it's true today of of a lot of
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:17.200]   still a lot of sites and remaining magazines when we talk about editorial content versus advertising
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:26.560]   in a really interesting way the advertising was the content that i wanted to look at i this is how
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:36.160]   i got a sense of what was actually going on i'm i'm into computer based music uh and i still
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:44.400]   subscribe to a couple of magazines that for me the advertising is at least as important as the
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:49.760]   editorial because i have a much better sense of what's really happening in that industry
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:56.400]   and an idea of things i might want to look at more closely so i i i think it's hilarious that
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:04.400]   there's this i know that the the rule is for very good reasons and for postal reasons that you
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:11.200]   want to have a robust national discussion and that's what the postage rates are about but they
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:19.600]   yeah i just think that one of the things i miss is leafing through and not turning pages past
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:25.440]   the advertising the way i do with the new york times magazine on sunday were really i'm not
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:32.240]   interested in the advertising i'm interested in the only in the articles where i was it was both
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:40.080]   in the case of this yeah i completely agree with you uh that there is that there was a certain merit
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:45.920]   in advertising in that case because it was something you wanted to know about and it was a new industry
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:50.080]   and it was exciting and you wanted to know about these new companies and what they were offering
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:54.480]   and every single ad was just as important probably as the as the articles i think that's a really
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:01.040]   good point maybe that's exactly what advertising should be uh in a way right instead of trying to
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:05.680]   figure out what people want will do affinity based content and uh and advertise that's that's
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:11.040]   how we sell our ads wait and the important part is to keep it straight which is which to so that's
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:18.880]   and and not to merge the two yes and pc magazine has had a very good record of doing honest editorial
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:28.720]   and sometimes labeling becomes an issue but the you know i want both yeah no in fact i learned
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:33.360]   you know from the best when we i've worked for ziff davis for a while never wrote for pc magazine
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:39.600]   but i worked for them and and bill macrone and lance eulandoff and jim ladderback and their ethical
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:46.080]   standards uh you know it's if davis television and uh and everything they did were so high and that's
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.640]   the standard we want to keep i remember jim going around the studio and putting black tape over all
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:56.800]   the brand names and the product in the studio so so it wouldn't become an ad for that product or
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:01.200]   this product or that product i'll tell you another another big benefit of working from home is you
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:07.360]   don't overhear people with the water cooler talking about what ads sold or how much money was made
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:11.280]   off of something because every now and then it would happen you'd be like oh god i don't want to
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:18.000]   i don't want to know don't tell me that i remember we were going to do an ad a segment on the
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:25.120]   screen savers about how to hack the xbox and uh microsoft is a massive advertiser at the time on
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:33.120]   uh on uh on uh zd tv and i think reasonably we might have been a little over concerned but we said you
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:36.960]   know we just want to let you know we're going to do this and microsoft is not going to like it
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:41.600]   and to their credit they they had a toro people and the ad people said no no do it
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:48.080]   uh you know it's important it's journalism and we'll deal with the uh the blowback and there was
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:53.520]   a lot of blowback uh i think microsoft may be in fact that i can remember that that happened with
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:57.360]   some magazines too where microsoft said all right well that's it no more ads but you know when your
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:03.440]   pc magazine nobody's going to say no we're not going to buy ads there anymore you mentioned a
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:09.680]   computer music uh dan uh of key figure in the development of computer music passed away
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:18.480]   uh this week dave smith who was the inventor of midi he uh he was at a company called sequential
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:24.720]   circuits created a number of uh sequencers and programmers to be used with the moog and arpe
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:30.640]   synthesizers back in the day uh he helped design the profit which was a very popular
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:36.160]   uh synthesizer you've heard you've heard it on thriller and uh and madonna's like a virgin
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:45.520]   uh vangelis used it uh in his uh jerets of fire um he also developed midi which stands for musical
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:52.880]   instrument digital interface um it allowed you to synchronize your instrument in fact to this day
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:57.600]   i think even if you're connecting via usb you're using the midi protocol when you connect
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:09.840]   in the midi midi is the tcpip of music yeah and it is uh you cannot overstate how important it was
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:16.480]   and what it influenced in standard making and and rules making protocols in the future by other
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:23.680]   people it was it was the thing everyone looked to to say see it can be done and the industry
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:32.400]   cooperated it's uh just just a tremendous achievement and something that we all have benefited from
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:38.080]   Dave smith the inventor passed at the age of 72 if you want to see a beautiful picture of him
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:46.560]   uh with his synthesizers go to sequential dot com and i thought it'd be appropriate to uh to
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:53.760]   mention that i didn't know dan that you were into computer music back back in my 20s i played
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:59.600]   music for a living for a few years so it was uh yeah uh we also we'll talk more about this on mac
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:05.040]   break weekly because he was a good friend of alex uh linsies but a member of the family john foster
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:11.120]   who was an early uh contributor to a mac break shows uh actually came up with the name pixel core
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:18.000]   uh has passed away uh as well far too young um but we will talk we'll i think give him a more
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:23.840]   fitting uh memories uh on mac break weekly because of course alex and he were close friends and i
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:29.440]   remember him very well he was a great man to work with uh and we will miss him as well uh
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:34.480]   that was a fun show i think we should do more shows from my home
