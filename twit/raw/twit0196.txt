[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I think for the first time on Twit, Dan Bricklin, who is a

[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   this is professional. This is how John, you're being put to shame.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   >> Hey, so, Dan, do you have a black cloth, the felt cloth behind you?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   What's the deal with you? >> I sure do.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   >> Want me to zoom out? >> Yeah, let's see what's in the whole set.

[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> It was an interesting story. I wanted to do a video about copyright open source,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   stuff like that. And I had a choice, either pay a videographer to do it,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   or do it myself. So what I did is I taught a videographer how to blog,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   in return, he told me what to buy and set up my studio for me here in my office.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   >> What a great idea. >> So I ended up buying all this cool equipment,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   which ended up being my initial podcasting equipment also.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   >> That's very cool. And now, you know, you could be doing what I'm doing.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   You could do a 24/7 Brooklyn TV. >> Oh, sure.

[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   >> Well, yeah, well, there isn't, unfortunately.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Somebody called me on the radio show said, "Leo, I want to start the first 24/7
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Internet network." And I said, "Well, may not be the first.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   What is it about? Twitter."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   >> Oh, my God. And I said, "God bless you. Good luck."
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   >> Well, in Twitter, you have a little hole about this big that you can see things through.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's, you know, not HD. It's very small. >> Yes.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   >> So I can't wait. I want to talk to you about your new book,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   "Brooklyn on Technology," about what you've been up to, about blog gaming, and so forth.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But I guess, kind of traditionally on Twitter, we go through news stories, too.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So we're going to do a perform, a pro-forma look at the week's news.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And then I want to grill Dan Bricklin.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   >> You know, I, you can download Visicalk now. It's like 64K.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   >> Less? >> Less.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   >> It ran in less. It's, yeah, it's like, what, 20, 30K?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Because it had a run in 64K with all of the papers.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> Of course. >> Yeah, of course, the OS. Plus the screen buffer.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   When, what year was that?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> Well, the original Visicalk came out in 1979.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   It was announced, oh, a few weeks from now, 30 years ago.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   >> So it's, this is the anniversary.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> This is, this year's the anniversary.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   >> Wow. >> A couple weeks ago was the first time it was shown privately to the
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Computer Press. That was at the West Coast Computer Fair.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And then it was shown publicly in early June at the National Computer Conference in New York,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and shipped in October of '79.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And the version that you can download is a little more advanced.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It was an early version of the IBM PC version that we shipped right when the IBM PC came out.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   >> But the first version was Apple II. >> Yep.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   >> In fact, it was, it was the first, the original killer app.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   It was the program, there you go. It was the program that made the Apple II
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   succeed as a business tool.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> Yeah, so it already had succeeded as a game tool and, and for other things.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   >> Yeah. >> Yeah, people were playing Chop Lifter.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And then they said, wow, you can induce, you could, well, nobody, well,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   we're going to get into this because if nobody had ever heard of a spreadsheet before, I mean,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   they were paper spreadsheets, but the idea of doing it on a computer was brand new.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Really cool. And, and yes, you can get the executable.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   What am I saying? It's on Brooklyn.com. You're, you, you have it. You offer it.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   >> Yep. I got permission from IBM Lotus to, to let you be downloaded.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   >> Oh, that's really, did they buy it?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   >> Well, our company was eventually bought by Lotus, which was eventually bought by IBM
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   and IBM and, IBM and real estate. >> I don't see.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   >> All right, news stories. And there are a couple of Twitter ones.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So, John, if you want to just walk away from it right now, you can. I, I won't blame you.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   >> Well, actually these particular stories interest me.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   >> I think it's kind of interesting too. Lance Armstrong, who is a very active
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Twitterer, actually kind of pissed off the press.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   He's in the tour of Italy right now. And he, Twitter is a lot.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And in fact, to the point now where he refuses to speak to the media after the time trials
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   on Thursday, he just, he tweeted, he went right to the, right to the fans and refused to talk
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   to the Italian media. Now you don't do that to Italian media.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   They had a tantrum. They said, well, that's it. We're not covering you.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   They, they, sections of Italian and English speaking media announced they will no longer
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   report on Armstrong's messages because he won't talk to them.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   He says, I'll talk to you, but I like Twittering.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Remember when he broke his arm? He was, or whatever it was he broke. He was probably from
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Twittering. Don't Twitter while you're Mike. But I think he twitted it before anybody knew.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And it was like a couple hours. So before it made the media.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So I think that what is this disintermediation, John, is this kind of.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Absolutely. Yeah. I think it's a really good example of it. I don't know how far it's going to get.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   But I know a lot of people that, you know, use Twitter as a source of news, breaking news in particular.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And the thing you're going to see is one of these days CBS is going to be reporting from somebody,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I mean, be reporting or using Twitter or somebody doing some tweets as a source, which will be kind of interesting,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   kind of like his free stringers. The thing you have to note, which I think is slightly objectionable,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   is that when people start picking up on using this as a news source, they're not going to be paying anybody.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And in the olden days, they would. You mean the stringers would get paid?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Yeah. These guys, you know, Twitter is just going to, you know, it's going to be bragging rights.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Well, you get what you pay for 140 characters. How much?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I don't know. I, you know, if you happen to be the only one there who's on the spot,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I can see you starting to, you'll do an auction right on the spot and say, who am I going to direct message to?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   That's what happens with photos, isn't it?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Right. Look what happened to the guy. The first photos were tweeted, right?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Of that plane that fell and that went into the mirror.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   The miracle on the Hudson. Yeah.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Yep. But he didn't get any money for it. But he, but you're saying that, in fact, this one might be,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I mean, road to revenue for Twitter. They could, they could set up an auction.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Yeah. Well, immediately whoever's there is going to get a tweet from a, from an agent and the agent's going to say,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Hey, I'll get you a good deal. That's unbelievable.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Well, once it, once it becomes, that's the way that it is. I mean, it takes a while to do it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   You know, they, the stories going around that the Twitter is finally going to figure out a monetize.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   They're going to start charging companies to be on Twitter. Do companies stick around if they get charged?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I guess they do. I guess you have to be there. I wouldn't, I wouldn't pay for it.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And so how much, yeah, well, if it's about dollar a month, I mean, what would, well, yeah, it depends how much.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Yeah. It depends on what it is they give you for that.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Yeah. I mean, can they can't prevent Comcast from being on Twitter. They'd have to give them something.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And I'll tell you, Twitter doesn't have a lot to give right now. It's infrastructure is terrible.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   It searches it working again. It's, they just don't seem to be able to scale this thing at all.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   But if you pay them, maybe they'll let you have the secret account that is fair work.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Fails will make it work. They're just getting your used to having it a low level.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   They can really move it up if they want. No, fail wells. Five bucks a month. Come on.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   The other story from Twitter is that we're kind of surprising United, maybe not.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Maybe this is, this is the kind of thing that companies would pay for. United Airlines is offering deals to Twitters.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   According to Mashable, United Airlines is tweeting what they call Twairs.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Oh God. Terrible. Terrible.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Special Fairs, if you follow them on Twitter, hurry, it says, and get your first ever time sensitive Twair.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   $63 one way, Chicago to DC plus tax additional terms, and then they give a tiny URL book soon.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Again, I think this is probably a good way not only to build followers, which is of value, but also to
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   build a clientele.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   What's the ad? I'm sorry. What's the ad thing for that? If you wanted to sign on?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   It is, I don't know. It's just at United Airlines, one word at United Airlines, I guess.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   You could follow them.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Yeah, I will. Well, that's the thing. Won't everybody, right? And this is a real deal.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Well, people who travel. Yeah.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   If you sign up for a company's email deals, then you would sign up for this.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   But this can be really fast. I mean, they could tweet to people in line or something like that.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Do you want to upgrade or whatever? They could all sorts of cool things.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Well, it's also valuable for airlines. There's nothing
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   stailer than an unsold airline seat.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   This would be a great way they could do their own consolidation.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   We've got five seats left to the flight to Singapore. You get down to the airport in one hour.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Do auctions? Yeah.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I'm in.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   All right. That was it. That's the Twitter. Unless I come up with something else.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   That's the Twitter. No, no, no. You don't have to come up with anything else. Those were great.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Hey, did you see the Sunday in the Sunday funniest there was on one of them, at least?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   It was all about Twitter. Oh, dear.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Yeah. At least in the Boston Globe it was.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Here's this is an interesting article from a guy named Jeff Chappelle, who was a software analyst.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   That's that's his name of his blog. Jeff Chappelle, software analyst.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Only thing missing is frontier software analyst. But he makes an interesting point. He says that the light,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   you know, we've always said that, well, if you want more than, if you want four gigs or more of RAM,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   you should go 64-bit OS.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   32-bit versions of Windows won't support more than three, some gigs of RAM,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   because some of it's reserved for video space and so forth. He says, you know, because of PAE,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   every version of Windows will work with more than four gigs of RAM. Microsoft just turns it off.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Oh, really? Well, you know, and there's been some dissent. I kind of posted this on Friend Feed
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and got some expert input. People said, well, PAE, which is physical address, physical address.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   What is it? I can't remember what it stands for. It's basically that segmentation. Remember, this is
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   something that's been part of Intel. I'm sure, Dan, when you move to the Intel processor, you have to live with this.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Physical address extension is the idea of, I guess, of segmentation.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Yeah. And it does, you know, yeah, the address registers are 32 bits that would top out of four gigs,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   but you can segment, page it effectively and see much more. And it works just fine. In fact, this guy removed
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   a some registry code and was able to get Windows 32 to see eight gigs of RAM, no problem.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   So does he have the registry fix posted? Yeah, it's on his site. Now he says, I didn't do any testing for speed
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and stuff. But he said it works. He shows, you know, the picture of it. He shows it all working.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Well, at least that dialog box works. Yeah. Well, that's, you know, I guess that's the question.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Do you have any experience with PAE, Dan? And does this seem credible?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Well, it seems credible to be able to make parts of something, know about more memory and use different ways.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   I mean, segmentation goes back to my college days and stuff. But, you know, to test it, I mean, it may be the same
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   code. It might not be the same code. And anyway, they can charge. I mean, this goes way back. IBM used to have a thing where if you cut one wire,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   some of their machines would suddenly run faster. This goes back 40, 50 years. And that way they could ship the one machine
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   and you just paid for whatever speed you wanted.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Intel did that with a seller on. They disabled the L2 cache. Right. So, you know, that's just how much you want to pay for it.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   The fact that they've already shipped it. Is that any difference than somebody sending you trialware and then sending you a code to turn it on?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   No, I guess the thing that would upset me is that it's been widely, you know, rooted about that. Oh, no. It's a 32-bit operating system.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It cannot access more than four gigs. And you have to have 64-bit if you want to do four gigs or more. And if that's not technically true,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   if it's just a license issue, then that's not quite honest. I mean, if there's a technical reason it can run a, you know, run more RAM,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   then they should say, well, we don't license it for more RAM. They're not going to do that, I understand.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Yeah. And it may be more complicated than that. But that's, I'm not into the kernel of, and the differences of all those.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   I spend much more time client-side working with Ajax and stuff like that. Isn't that funny now how that's changed?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I mean, hacking now is really high, much higher level than it used to be. Well, there are different places to do it.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And being able to run on all different machines has its advantages. And you have to sort of pick where you want to spend your time.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Right. And I decided to spend my time much more in a lot of the open source languages and client-side and things like that for a while.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   By the way, I found that URL. If you go to comics.com/jump_start.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Oh, jumpstart? Yeah. Jumpstart. Yeah, go to them today's comic. It's about a guy getting arrested.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And he wants his handcuffs off so he can tweet that he was arrested.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Who was it? The guy got arrested that student got arrested in Egypt. The blogger got arrested in Egypt and he tweeted about it.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Worked for him. Oh, that's so funny. Oh, that's so funny.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Would you mind removing my handcuffs? I have to tweet.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Just shut up thought about that at home.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Officers, I got a tweet as soon as possible. You're just gonna have to hold it.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Actually, tweeting involves his PDA. He tells his pals what he's up to all during his day.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Sounds stupid and boring. This guy looks kind of like you, John.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Hey. Usually it is, but today was different. I got busted by the cops.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Anything you tweet can and will be used against you. That's pretty funny, I guess.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   So, I've seen a full Twitter comic and a major comic.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It shows its mainstream enough that people would read comic pages. Funny pages would get it.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I mean, that the general audience would get it. I guess it is. Once Oprah starts talking about something.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So, let's go back to something Dan said, which is that the idea that you can clip a wire
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   at an IBM computer and the speed triples or somebody.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Sorry. About the amount of memory you can access to pagination or however you want to describe it.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Is the same as trialware, which is something I disagree with that concept.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Because trialware is something you sign on to, it's just essentially to try something.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And then they give you a code to use it after you either pay for it or something.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   I mean, it's a process. It's not like somebody tricking you.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It's not as though you bought something product A and it turns out to be trialware.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And after you've paid for it, you have to go through some rigomer role.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   So, I don't think that analogy is very good. I was mulling it over there.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Took them a while. I meant it in terms of you only have to ship it once.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   So, you don't have to have something else come in.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   You can right away get instant gratification in terms of them being able to give you the
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   improvement that you want.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Remember, some of the things you get are you have the free version and then you download
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   a code like you do it or something. And then suddenly you get the--
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Yeah, it opens up a box. Windows Vista does that.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   When you get that disk with Windows Vista, it's got every version on it.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And if you want to-- I mean, that actually was pretty smart.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Microsoft, you know, you're sitting there, you're saying, "Gosh, I really need ultimate."
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   It's there. You got it. All you have to do is get a code and unlock it.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   So, I guess in that, it kind of is in that respect, although it doesn't--
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   You can't turn it into 64-bit Windows. You got to reinstall that.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I just find it disturbing that Microsoft, you know, essentially--
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I don't understand these multiple--
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I mean, is there one best Windows Vista?
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And why do we need all these little ones that are--
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Well, it's-- they're going to pretty much do the same thing again.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Although with Windows 7, although my buddy Paul Therat--
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   and we'll talk about it on Windows Weekly this week--
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   got a little scoop. Microsoft said there's going to be a Windows 7 starter edition.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Pretty much intended for developing nations that will have--
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   it'll be cheap, but you can only run three applications at the same time.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   You try to launch a fourth. You'll say, "Sorry, you can't do that with this version."
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Yeah. No, we've talked about that on cranky gigs, actually.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I think it's, you know, ridiculous.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Well, they back down. You were right.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Paracordia, Paul Therat. Microsoft has taken that restriction out.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   I know, you know--
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I guess it's ridiculous.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I agree with you on that one.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Is it ridiculous? I mean, really, come on.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   If we want to make a cheap version for developing nations--
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   You know, that's just another excuse to--
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   it's just a rationalization because Microsoft's overcharges for its products
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   and everybody knows it by now. I mean, when you can get--
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   you want something cheap for developing nations,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   give them a copy of Ubuntu in some reference machine.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It's free. And you can use Abbey Soft, Abbey Word.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Yeah. That's a great good point.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   It's a beautiful clone of Windows Word 2003.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And there's, you know, they've got the browsers and all the rest of it's all there.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Yeah. Why not just, yeah. Why not use a free operating system?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Really, in fact, they shouldn't use the phrase "developing nations."
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   It's really intended for the pirating nations.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   That's who it's meant for.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Places where they can't charge the full price.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Right. Places where it's--
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Well, look at China. I mean--
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   There's where it's a dollar.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   It's a dollar. You go to the store.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   It's not openly sold in most of the Southeast Asian area.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   You get the disc. It's a dollar.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   In fact, they have, you know, the most expensive version I've ever seen one time.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I think it was in the Kuala Lumpur I saw.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And it was a store in a mall.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   And they had a copy.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I thought it was really one of the more interesting bootlegs.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   It was a copy of up to-- I think it was up to XP at the time.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Every single version of Microsoft DOS and Windows.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Oh, we should pick that up for me. I could have used that.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Not thinking about it. I probably should have grabbed one.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Yeah, that'd be really handy.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   It was just 2.3. All of them, all of them.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And it was like the idea was, you know, it would be just handy for people developing,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   you know, the ultimate compatible software.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   That'd be very handy. I would--
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Developers got copies of everything.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I mean, if you sign up as a developer and get all their super CDs,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   you get all this neat stuff and you can put it on all these different machines.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I used to get that the MSDN ultimate subscription.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And you get these big notebooks.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   It's like six feet on the shelf for one year's worth of stuff.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   It's everything.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   You must get that. I mean, you're developing.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I did for years, but it takes up a lot of the space over there.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   You can download it all now. I think you can get it all online.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Yeah, I sort of stopped doing that.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And now, as I said, I'm mainly working in a Jackson stuff.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Nielsen reports.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Oh, get this. I'm gonna-- this is a little quiz for y'all.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Internet TV is growing.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   It's growing fast.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   According to Nielsen, which monitors not only regular television viewing,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   but they do monitor internet use.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   About 131 million people watch internet video per month.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   They average about three hours.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Now, that's a big increase. It was 116 million averaging two hours a year ago.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   They also say about 13 million people watch it on their mobile phone,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   which is up 52% from last year.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   And they watch even more.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   People watch it on the mobile phone, watch three and a half hours.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   However, those numbers pale when you compare it to actual television watching.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Do you want to guess? Do you, gentlemen, what wish to-- don't know peaking.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Guess how many hours of TV Americans watch on average every month?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I don't-- see, I would guess a couple hours a day, right?
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   I would guess two to three hours a day.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   So I think you could probably hit three times 30, which would be 100-- let's say 100 hours easy.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   153 hours averaging more than five hours a day.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Yeah, that's too much.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   That's too much.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Too much watching TV.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   What the hell are they watching?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I actually do watch a number of shows religiously.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   I think the mentalists is a really good drama.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   I still watch the law and orders.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And I watch 30 Rock and maybe one of those.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   I probably watch-- you're bringing the average up, John.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I'm probably watching 10 hours a week, which is about 40, maybe 40.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   How much are people just leaving it on sort of like while you're doing this?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Or like while you're doing the dishes, while you're doing other stuff, while you're talking to people?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Well, that's true.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I think there's a lot of households, which is just on all day.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   It starts in the morning and just left on all day.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   99% of video viewing, 98.8% is television.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Only 1.2% is on the internet.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   It's a growth market.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   There, thank you, John.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   I was looking for that spin.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   That's what it is.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   We're growing.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   It's like wide open.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Unless it's growth a lot.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Unless it's a trend where it freezes, where in other words, it stops growth.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   In other words, it stops growing.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Even though I don't see the growth rate going up that fast, obviously from those figures,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   it's like it's-- but it is growing.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   It's not dead market.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Well, 116 million, 131 million, that's growth in a year.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Yeah, it's something.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But what do they mean by video?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Are they talking about YouTube?
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Are they talking about YouTube?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   They're not talking about Hulu.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   They're not talking about-- well, I think Hulu is talking about YouTube.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Yeah, it's huge.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   But they're talking about YouTube is talking about Hulu.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   They're not talking about me.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   I can tell you that.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   But they are talking about Hulu.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   They are talking about YouTube.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And yeah, I mean, I look at my kids.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   That's what they watch.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   For them, that's their TV time.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   If they're going to watch the office, well, here's the-- here's-- I think what's telling.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   It doesn't matter to them if it's on TV, if it's on TV, or if it's on Hulu.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   They just watch whatever is convenient.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   They don't care.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Yeah, and it used to be that the TV that they had was this big 13 or 15 inch TV that they
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   had in their room or maybe--
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Right.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Right.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   That used to be a big TV.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   You know, you get a laptop and it's going to be 15 inches.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Exactly.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   It's bigger than your TV.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Your old TV.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   When we were kids, why are you lucky if you had black and white?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I actually do-- I've--
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I had green and black for a while.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Well, the early color was so bad.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I remember very well when I was a kid.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   My dad refused to buy a color TV, so-- because everybody's green.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   We had a black and white TV.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   I think until the late '60s, maybe even the early '70s.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I remember our first color TV was a Sony Trinitron.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Boy, that was a big deal.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And he was right.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   You know what?
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   The color was really awful for a long time.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   You know, I wonder if the viewing thing would be-- if the way the numbers are skewed would
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   be affected by things like initiatives like Boxy, which essentially is internet viewing
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   but on the TV.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   In fact, then I was looking at a--
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   That's the future.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I think that's the future.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I was looking at a Sony, by the way, that-- that-- that-- that--
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Harren had-- Robert Harren had in the back at ZD, he was looking at.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And this Sony was one of the-- can't remember the model number, but it had internet connections
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   on it and had all these weird things on the side.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   And you just plug it, basically, just plug it into the internet or to an ethernet cable.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And then it had one menu item that brought you to all this online video stuff,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   including a bunch of pre-packaged stuff.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   They had cranky geeks on the menu.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Really?
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   So I hit the button to watch cranky geeks.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And I'm watching cranky geeks on a 50-inch Sony.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   How did it look?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   It looked a lot better than it should.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   They did a real good job of fixing whatever, you know, kind of-- it had no artifacting,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   but it didn't have full 30 frames per second.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   It seemed to be more like 24 or something.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   It had just a fair-- but it wasn't bothersome.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   And the mouths were synced.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Wow.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And it was actually watchable as a show.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   That's actually very intriguing.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Basically, it's an Apple TV built into a Sony TV set kind of thing.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   That's what I'm guessing.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Have you taken Hulu and go on, you know, right from your Mac or whatever,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   right to your big screen TV?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   I have friends who do that and they just sit there, rather watch it.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   In HD, it looks pretty good.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   And we had some iOS in our town.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   That's what Boxy did, and that's when Hulu stopped him.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   It kept stopping him.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Boxy keeps fixing it.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   But yeah, that's how I've watched it.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   It's fine.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   I mean, it's not-- because I'm watching on Wi-Fi.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   I have a decent cable connection, but you know, cable internet connection.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   But the Wi-Fi, I think, slows it down a little bit.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   So the frame rate is a little worse.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   I think kids probably aren't going to have the same sensitivity to frame rate that we will
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   going forward.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   They might just get used to it.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Well, you know, that reminds me of my daughter, who was in the room a second ago, but now
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   she's gone so I can talk about her behind your back.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:21.720]   She has like a penchant for-- we have this big screen TV up here that has all the HD stuff
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.160]   going into one of the inputs.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.040]   And then the games and all the other stuff go into another one of the inputs.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.120]   And when she flips to a game and then flips back to TV, the TV also goes into the-- in
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.680]   other words, we have two feeds.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:41.600]   And she doesn't care to push it over to the HD feed ever.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.240]   And she keeps saying that there's no difference.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.440]   And even though there's a huge difference because it's for one thing, the whole screen
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.400]   is filled up instead of, you know, a letterboxed.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.920]   And it's crystal clear.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.920]   And the other one she doesn't care.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.920]   Wow.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.920]   John's bathroom.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.920]   Maybe she's just giving me a name.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.640]   Remember the days of-- we worked so hard on letter quality printing, which wanted to
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.280]   get output that looked really, really good, looked as good as a good typewriter.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.760]   And then people took it and stuck it in the facts.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.400]   And the facts looked horrible.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.280]   And they didn't care because they got what they wanted.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   Well--
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.680]   And there's a whole generation that's growing up listening to music on crappy MP3 players.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   Yep.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   They don't know why they don't care.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.000]   And you talk to them about getting a big speaker system that makes it sound like you're
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   in the place.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Yeah, who cares?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   If you're not reminded, we had-- when I was doing Silicon Spin once, we had Todd
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Rungren on the show.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.760]   And we got into a discussion about high f-- you know, super high-fi and some of the new stuff
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.760]   coming out.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.160]   And he made the comment that he didn't think it was important in the least.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.840]   You know, people don't care that much about the sound.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.840]   Real.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.920]   And I-- you know, there's just a group of people.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   He was right.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   Yeah, you apparently--
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.920]   He was right.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.120]   People don't even-- you know, they used these earbuds.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:56.800]   And it's just decimated the whole stare of the high-five business, where you used to, you
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.960]   know, get a receiver and a bunch of big speakers and, you know, a big subwoofer and you, you
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.360]   know, shake the house.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:09.280]   I've-- I've really forgotten how-- you know, used to-- you used to be able to really sound
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.480]   have great stereo sound.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.720]   And the music would move you and be incredible.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.360]   And you know, you forget about that.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.080]   It all sounds kind of cheesy and tinny now.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.840]   And that's just what we're used to.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.120]   Well, just like what happened with the telephone, we went from telephones wired and they're supposed
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.360]   to be so good and whatever.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.200]   And then we went to these cell phones that are very unreliable.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.920]   Don't get me started.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   Right.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.920]   Okay.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.920]   Then we switched from now.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.920]   But listen, we're on Skype.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   Listen, how good it sounds.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.920]   Right.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.640]   And people, when they hear Skype, they go, "Oh, my God.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   That's incredible."
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.080]   It's like, "I'm in the room."
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.600]   So eventually it gets there.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.880]   You can tell-- you can tell the difference, but most people don't know that they can tell
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   the difference.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.680]   I mean, the same thing happens with video with--
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.720]   I mean, as I learn about microphones, you know, this, you know, a pro.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.920]   They listen to some of the crap that I do and then they go, "Oh, you know, all right,
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.720]   if you use the right mic, you know, you want to have the--"
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.880]   You know, put pillows all around and stuff like that.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.760]   And, you know, and it does make a difference.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.200]   I remember listening to some pod-- some of the early podcasts, when Dave Weiner would
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.720]   do his podcasts, some of them he would do like with the mic that's built into the--
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.720]   Oh.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.560]   --he'd be off like here.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.560]   Right.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.800]   And he doesn't even sound that good.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.320]   And I found out that if I was out there running, you know, I was listening to podcast while
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.200]   I was running, if I went by traffic, I couldn't understand it.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Right.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.000]   But if I had really good sound, it would work in those situations.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.640]   And I realized, "Aha, I'm doing my listeners a favor by going to all that trouble, but
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.320]   they won't know it."
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:44.160]   You know, even if it's really poor, the content does matter.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   John, I don't know if you remember-- or Leo, a long time ago, there was an online encycloped--
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.680]   not online, it was a CD encyclopedia-like thing.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.280]   And one of the things it had was video, it was very early videos, this horrible crappy
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.240]   little stuff, you know, you could barely see it.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   Postage stamp.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   Postage stamp.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   And people laughed about that.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.040]   And I said, "Let me show you this one video.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.680]   It's a video of a giraffe giving birth."
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.000]   So they start watching.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.440]   And in this horrible little video, you see a giraffe giving birth.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.800]   And you know, the giraffe stands up when it gives birth, it falls down, the after birth
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.760]   comes down, after it splashes all.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.840]   And they're fascinated.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.320]   And they forget that they're looking at that.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   They get lost in the content.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.280]   The content trumps the presentation.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   Yes.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.880]   I guess that's what's happening.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.480]   It's just kind of, you know, conchially, though.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.400]   I mean, there's a thing like with the microphones, for example.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.360]   I mean, people do notice these-- Leo and I are using right now and that we're both
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:43.520]   using these very nice big diaphragm mics that make you sound very clear, even though
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.240]   it's kind of bassy.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.440]   And as people notice that some more relaxing sound, it doesn't fatigue you.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.240]   I mean, there's a thing called listener fatigue, which is some people just don't even want
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.120]   to think about, which is that you use these crappy mics that are poorly balanced and
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:03.080]   you start listening to people on these systems.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.200]   And after a while, they actually tires because the brain has to do so much work to piece
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.000]   the thing together so you can hear it like you're talking about complaining about the
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.280]   noise and the traffic and then trying to hear somebody talk.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.640]   And it wears some people out.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.480]   And I think at some point it damages the quality of the product overall because people just
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.280]   stop listening to it and they don't know why.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.640]   They don't know why, yeah.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.840]   It's like fonts, you know, good fonts and why they have serfs and all these other things.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.080]   There are all these little things that were developed over many years that we didn't realize.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.480]   But the pros know about it.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:42.320]   And as you say, it does help us, which is why I have my expensive mic sitting here.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   So what am I going to use?
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   I'm using a pro.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.960]   And SM7B, sure, which I have for a strange reason.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:57.520]   I was listening to, what was it, the early podcasts with Adam Curry and Adam said that's
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.520]   what he was using.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.640]   And I figured if it's good enough for Adam Curry, it's good enough for me.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.600]   And he sounded so good, but I didn't realize it was his voice to, you know, who I actually
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.400]   have the crystal, the voice.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.280]   So I have, you know what he uses now?
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   What?
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.160]   There's a lavalier that he's fallen in love with.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.560]   That's the one that goes in your lapel.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.560]   Oh, please.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.000]   And I just, he's talked about it before.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.360]   It's not like a secret.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.160]   And he hangs it.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.240]   So it's dangling in front of him.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.840]   And it, and he just, for some reason, he thinks he sounds so much better on this particular.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.000]   And there are some good lavaliers.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.360]   I mean, you have for people out there, we don't have to go too much inside baseball.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.280]   But Leo, at least at the studio there has a couple of these things called countrymen.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.280]   Yeah, they're great.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.160]   They do are, or, which is not quite a lavalier, but they do make one, but there's some more.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.160]   It's small enough.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.560]   The cap, so it's a condenser mic.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.640]   The difference between what you and I are using.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.640]   The beauty thing.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.880]   And these is that we're using dynamic microphones that aren't powered.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.800]   These are powered condenser mics.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   And they are, it's tiny.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   This is what the TV preachers use.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   Right.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   It's very small.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   They're very small.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.400]   And they, the first time I used one, which was a couple of years ago, because someone
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.040]   said, no, these are the guy that you won't believe what you sound.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.120]   They, for some reason, are astonishing.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.120]   But they have to be close-miked.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   They have to be close-miked.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.960]   And it keeps, they keep falling off your ear.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.120]   I, we can overall like, you know what they do?
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.960]   And these are in Broadway and they do.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:28.520]   And the Broadway shows is they'll use a flesh-colored tape and they'll tape it to your cheek.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.240]   I don't think they sound as good or that's what, that's what, I mean, we use them, I
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.240]   stopped using them.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.240]   I don't think they sound quite as good.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.800]   All I'll, you know what I'll do is I'll plug it in and I'll switch over to it and you
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   can hear what it sounds like.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:44.160]   You know, I think that's where a lot of our processing power is going to go in the future
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.880]   to sort of take all the crappy mics and stuff and try to figure out how to make things sound
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.200]   better so that you can walk around like Dave did and end up with sound that sounds like
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.440]   what you're getting right now.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.920]   Well, you know, one of the, it's about five years ago, Texas Instruments, you know, has
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.880]   a digital amplifier that they like to play around with and it's going into the market
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.760]   in different forms.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.000]   And they bought out one of the great digital amp companies.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.520]   They've done all these different things and one of the demos they gave was to using software
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.680]   to recreate the exact sound of various expensive speaker systems on a pair of the cheapest
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.480]   little realistic dogs.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.520]   You know, they got a radio shack and they did it.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.920]   Well, it seems like you could, by the way, I'm now on the country.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   You sound terrible.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.920]   Oh, it's awful.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.000]   It's because he's over, he's over, he's over, he's over, over, he's over, over, he's over
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   my, yeah, how's that?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Is that better?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.160]   It seems like you could with intelligent DSP technology probably clean it all up, right?
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.320]   It's just a software issue.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.960]   I mean, where did that deep voice disappear?
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.960]   I know.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.280]   See, it's much hotter because you don't have that, I'll have to talk like this.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.480]   You don't have the big diaphragm to resonate.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.640]   It doesn't sound bad though.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.280]   No, in fact, if you hadn't heard the PR40 before, you'd say this sounds fine.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:03.160]   Yeah, and the PR40 is a specifically mellow microphone that it's just, it's made for a
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.520]   lot of people have the right voice for it.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.280]   It is just a great microphone.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:13.640]   So actually I'd like Conan O'Brien's quote, he says, "Television allows you to watch things
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.360]   just as you would on your computer or cell phone except while seated in a more comfortable
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360]   chair."
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.040]   It's really just the seating.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   It's the difference.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040]   I agree.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.720]   All right, we're going to come back.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   More stories, we're talking with Dan Bricklin, the creator of VisiCalc and Blogger extraordinaire,
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.040]   Guru, who still has his hands just as many pies.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.040]   He's not retired.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.520]   And of course, and a new book.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.520]   Thank you.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.160]   But let's give it a big plug, Bricklin on technology.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.520]   It's Wiley and Sons?
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.520]   Yes.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.520]   And it's great.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.320]   We're going to actually talk about that book in a bit.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.520]   And John C. Devorak is also here from Channel Devorak.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.840]   But I do want to mention our friends that go to my PC.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.560]   I know you both know Ed Yaquabucci who created Citrix many, many moons ago and really
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:08.920]   began a journey that go to my PC as kind of the culmination of a journey of remote access.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.480]   He was very instrumental in the OS2 team.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   He was at IBM.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:16.200]   Really, I think wrote much of the NT kernel and became an expert on the NT kernel and
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.960]   remote access.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.480]   And the software that Citrix has created is still used today, licensed by Microsoft.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.120]   They do remote access better than anybody else.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:32.840]   Go to my PC, puts that super high quality, super fast, super secure, remote access in
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.840]   your computer.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.000]   In fact, you can try it right now for 30 days, absolutely free.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.840]   Avoid rush hour traffic heading to work, avoid going in on the weekends.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.880]   Any time, I hear it all the time.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   I thank my lucky stars.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:52.680]   I listen to the radio and I hear the traffic reporters say, "Oh yeah, the Golden Gate Bridge
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.680]   is tied up.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.280]   Oh, it's a three hour commuting."
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.840]   And I go, "I don't have to do that.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.120]   I got to go to my PC.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.800]   I don't have to commute anymore.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.880]   I don't have to get in the car.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:07.040]   I can get to my office just by going online from anywhere, not just home and internet
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.600]   cafe, a hotel.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   Save time, save money.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   It's popping on me.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.000]   Save time, save money after moving out.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.640]   Save stress.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:23.600]   You'll try it free right now by going to go to myPC.com/twit and you get a 30 day free
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.160]   trial, go to myPC.com/twit, fire it up.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:34.440]   You can use any program, access any network resource, any file, check email, secure.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.800]   There's never been an exploit.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.280]   Uses industry standard TLS and SSL.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.000]   The best remote access service out there.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   I want you to try it free.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Go to myPC.com/windows.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Give it a try.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.600]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.920]   We use it all the time.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.960]   In fact, I have five accounts now.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   Five accounts in counting.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.240]   All right, I might get rid of this microphone.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   It's driving me crazy.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.240]   It's too...
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.160]   I want my bees back.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.320]   I wish you could go back and forth and back and forth with it.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.160]   Could give you an A/B comparison?
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.520]   I need a switch or something.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.520]   I could probably do that.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.520]   I would just have to...
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.720]   See, isn't that much better?
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   That's nicer.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.600]   There's a lower mid-range that exists in the PR42.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   Is it 42?
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   Or is it 42?
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   Or is it 40?
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   Sorry.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   40.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   That is very noticeable.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.880]   I think that lower mid-range is critical for...
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.040]   That's the pitch that you...
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.240]   I think that you use to understand speech.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.760]   If it's got a little bump there, I think it makes it more intelligible.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.360]   I don't know.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:38.600]   That's where Adam Curry's voice is perfect because it's got that...
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   It's almost an edge, I call it, but it gives it that...
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   If it's too...
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.000]   You can't understand it.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.760]   You need a little edge in there to understand the articulation.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.640]   Yeah, but you still have to enunciate.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.720]   He enunciates very well.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.440]   He's also got beautiful hair.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.080]   You know, you've got a good hair for a guy your age.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.080]   A pretty old guy.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.680]   I'm thinking Dan looks pretty good.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.680]   Look at that.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   Nice little...
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.680]   I'm the oldest of the three of us.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.800]   So, by just a little bit.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:12.040]   I think we're all of the same, roughly the same generation.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.040]   There are some...
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.640]   Actually, now that I look at it, there's some very interesting stories this week.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:23.160]   For instance, the OQO is gone.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.280]   That's kind of sad, but I guess inevitable.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.960]   And day one.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:32.200]   Yeah, in some ways, the fact that they lasted seven years.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   It's a miracle.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.840]   It's almost kind of amazing.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:39.360]   When I read that, I was running around looking for my old pocket.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   You know, the old pocket.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.360]   Poked.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.360]   Poked.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.360]   I couldn't find it.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.360]   It's back in the warehouse.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.360]   You do?
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.360]   I have two interesting ones.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.360]   They got a poquette.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.520]   And I also have that little radio shack piece of crap that they came out with.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.520]   Tami model 100?
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.520]   No, no, no.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.360]   They came out with a poquette clone.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.360]   That was...
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.360]   It used a software...
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.920]   It used an operating system called iDOT or something.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.520]   It was a clone of Microsoft.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.720]   And that's floating around.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.520]   But the poquette, I think, is collectible.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.520]   There's no talking about it.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.520]   Oh, maybe that's what it was.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.520]   You're right.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.520]   It's what it was.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   I have both of those two.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.520]   And the warehouse.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:21.360]   So this just proves that these little teeny weenie computers are fetish objects for geeks.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.760]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.240]   Yeah, they collect them.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.240]   They can't use it.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   Oh, yes.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.360]   We just have geeks that collected those two items.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.360]   Oh, no.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.360]   I think it's universal.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.080]   I don't have the Tandy 100.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.520]   I would have collected.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.920]   You could buy those still on eBay.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.000]   I mean, those are at a premium, I might add.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.320]   Those are still beloved by journalists everywhere.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.760]   That was, you know, there was a time if you went to a baseball game, every single person
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.560]   in the press box was using a model 100.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.920]   And that was the last machine that Bill Gates actually did real life code for that was,
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.680]   you know, not just a little game or something.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.680]   He--
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   Did he race it on that?
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.680]   What are you doing that?
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   I don't know.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   He did something in it.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.080]   But if you talk to him about coding, I think he wrote one of the games that was shipped
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.800]   with the IBM PC or something in basic one of the sample games.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:12.240]   But, you know, the real-- the last production real life code, I think it was the 100, he
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.240]   says.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   And he waxes poe.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.240]   I mean, you can see his eyes go, "Oh, yeah, that was the last real code that I got to
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   ship."
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.400]   Maybe now that he's out of Microsoft, he's getting to write some real code for fun.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.800]   Oh, please.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.440]   Oh, once-- if you're a coder, it's so much fun.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.640]   I mean, that's why I'm doing that.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.640]   I--
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.640]   He doesn't have enough time in the day.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.280]   I wish he would go write some code.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.400]   How about some code to fix Vista?
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.400]   That's called Windows 7.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   He's out of Microsoft.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.280]   He can write stuff in whatever he wants.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.200]   And for purposes like to help fight malaria or something while he's flying over there.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.400]   Do you think he might do that?
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   I don't know.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.400]   That'd be very cool.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.320]   I mean, don't you get-- no, Dan, Dan, Dan, I mean, be-- be brutally frank.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.960]   Don't you find that your brain just doesn't have the capacity to focus and retain all
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.880]   the loose threads and stuff that it did when you were a younger guy?
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.880]   I don't know.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.640]   I'm able to do some stuff that I'm still pretty proud of.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.720]   I mean, I look back at some old code I've written and I go, "Who wrote that?
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.720]   That was incredible."
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:12.720]   I say, "I wrote that.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.720]   How did I do that?"
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.040]   I look at other stuff and said, "What horrible person wrote that?
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.600]   Oh, my God, it's me."
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:23.560]   Sometimes-- I mean, if you have to be able to get into it, I mean, it still takes sometimes,
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.600]   you know, the 10 hours straight to be able to do the one little piece of code or something
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.960]   and do it for days.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:29.960]   Yes.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.760]   Steve Gibson, who's also our age, is working on a new project.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.960]   And he goes to Starbucks, gets there about $5.30 when they open, and stays till $7 or
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.960]   $8.90.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.120]   He stays 12 hours non-stop assembly language programming.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.640]   I think that's it.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.560]   You have to kind of get in a zone, don't you?
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.560]   And you have to get into your tools.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   It takes a while to get into the tool.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   Right.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.240]   Somebody said, "I think it was Randall Schwartz.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.120]   The Pearl Programmer said, "If I don't program in Pearl three hours a day, I lose it."
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.120]   That's Pearl.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.120]   That's Pearl.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.120]   That's Pearl.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.120]   I program in Pearl too.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:07.200]   I program in Pearl that looks more like visual basic and not more like APL like a lot of people.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.200]   Pearl is one of those tools.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.800]   If you don't use it regularly, you completely forget the syntax.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   But there are some languages that aren't like that.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   There's programs like that.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.000]   I mean, Adobe Illustrator is a good example.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.080]   MSCA curves, what are those?
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.800]   So OQO, I guess it was 2002.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:29.280]   I remember showing it on Regis and Kelly right around 2002.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:34.120]   You know why they finally just...
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.200]   What was it that finally put the nail and the coffin on this thing?
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.640]   I'm back through an article on this thing.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.640]   We are sad to report that due to financial constraints...
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.360]   Maybe you wanted to buy any of them, maybe the thing that...
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   Financial constraints.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.360]   They're saying, "We are not able to offer repair and service support at this time."
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:55.280]   We're deeply sorry that despite our best intentions, we are unable to provide continued
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.160]   support for our faithful customer.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.160]   That's sad because that means...
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.160]   Is that what you said?
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.440]   Yeah, I forgot to pluralize it.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.200]   There were two of them.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.200]   Well, that's...
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   I mean, you have to try.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.800]   I mean, we did all that software for these old pen computers for Go and all.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.800]   Go.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   Slate.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   Right.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.200]   And we write this really cool software and stuff, but nobody bought the machines.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.600]   So we sold like two copies of some of the software.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.520]   But it was just the end of its time.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.080]   I always refer to them as Go Broke.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.320]   Well, they kept changing the spec on the hardware.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.320]   Oh, and the hardware.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.000]   So you had to change your hardware.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.600]   So first we wrote to a 286.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.080]   Then you had to rewrite the whole thing for the 386.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.880]   Then they changed to the Hobbit chip.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:37.960]   And each time you're all...
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.800]   So before you could ship, you had to recode everything.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:47.840]   So plus people really didn't want a computer that was based upon handwriting and stuff.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   They like touch type of stuff.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.840]   And they couldn't do color.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.720]   The digitizers didn't do well with color.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.720]   Right.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:54.720]   So the contrast sucked.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.720]   I couldn't.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.720]   You could read it.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.200]   The grid was the grid the same kind of...
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.480]   Yeah, the grid pad, the grid converter was a good machine.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.360]   The grid convertible is a good machine.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:09.560]   But the thing is that they couldn't do digitizers well through, except for, I guess, the whackum
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.160]   or something, which was expensive.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.160]   But did they have to have...
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.560]   They have to have layers and they have to have a capacitance layer and all that stuff.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.360]   And then we just get dimmer and dimmer and dimmer by the time you were seeing through
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.520]   all these layers, it was like through a cloud.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:27.040]   Now, isn't there an item floating around the news gossip item that Apple will be doing
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.200]   a pad computer?
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.200]   There's...
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   The rumors are strong.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:37.080]   Although the question is timeframe, some think maybe they'll announce at June 8th at
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.120]   the developers' conferences coming up.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.120]   That seems unlikely.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   Others...
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.720]   Now the latest rumors, it'll be next year.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   But they bought...
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.720]   They bought according to...
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.720]   I think it was EE Times.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.360]   One of these Chinese electronics...
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.360]   EE Times is about them in Low Park.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.920]   Maybe it's not that one.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.880]   They bought a bunch of 10 and a half inch touch screens.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:03.120]   Well, if you use a netbook a lot, you realize that that's a really good idea to make a tablet
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.520]   of the type that they're talking about.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   Yeah, great.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.520]   Because you...
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.920]   Netbooks, the problem is they're horizontal and you like to read and they have small screens.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.160]   So you really want to turn it sideways and the keyboard is sticking out.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.400]   And for a lot of stuff, we don't need keyboard if we have touch.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.720]   And so it looks like it might be the time for it finally.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   We'll see.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.040]   But it's good that these people tried.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:27.640]   I mean, the fact that that old little Windows machine, you know, they tried and tried for
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:32.280]   a few years and just turned out that Windows wasn't right for a little machine when you
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.640]   could have a bigger machine.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   It ran...
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.720]   I remember the first one's ran XP and then it ran Vista and it was so tiny.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   You had a little stylus.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.720]   It was just...
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.800]   It was like just teensy.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   And you could barely...
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.520]   I mean, I don't know what the dot pitch was.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.680]   I know the one you're showing there is like huge by comparison to the original.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:57.280]   The original had like little bitty keys and it was super miniature.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.040]   Now suppose it had a user interface that was kind of like Android.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.800]   That would have been a lot different.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:10.440]   You know, Intel announced this week a mini operating system for Netbooks called Moblin.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.520]   It's an open source project based on Linux.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:17.440]   I downloaded and installed it on my wind and immediately took it off.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.240]   Immediately.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   They keep trying to do this.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.680]   And I think Android might be a little bit like that where it's a little stripped down and
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.680]   you just...
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.040]   I could see the motivation for the OQO.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:32.920]   You kind of want a full operating system, but the problems to solve, you know, are pretty
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.040]   significant to get a full operating system on something that size.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:43.520]   Well, at least we've learned with the iPod and the iPod Touch and all that there's a subset
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.760]   and a different set of applications that are worthwhile having in a portable environment.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.160]   And because everything's wired, you can do things that are dependent on being wired.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.960]   I mean, or wireless, you can be connected and you can do reading and things that you
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.880]   can use to be able to do.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.040]   You know, the Kindle has been relatively successful.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.040]   Love Kindle.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.040]   Right.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.760]   And it barely does anything, but it does at least one thing very well.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:10.600]   So you can see that that form factor might be okay because now there are enough useful
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:16.640]   things we can do with it that you don't need to bring your laptop, your full set of applications
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   with you.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.360]   You don't have to run Photoshop on it.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.440]   You don't have to run full word on it or things like that.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.440]   Yeah, Dan, do you use a iPhone or an Android and then why?
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.640]   Yeah, I use Android.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   Huh.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   But...
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   Not surprised.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   I would have picked that.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:41.160]   But I have an iPod touch that I used to learn about the interface and stuff like that.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.280]   No, I'll probably get a pre.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.360]   I'm excited about the pre.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.200]   The more I see about the pre, they just...
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:50.840]   And Gadget has a leaked pre-launch manual for the pre for business.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.840]   I think your pre-excitement is premature.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.640]   I think it's going to be pretty good.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.320]   But I think I have to pre-order the pre.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.320]   It's a pre-pre-order.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.320]   There's an interesting thing about the pre.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:07.360]   The programming is done in systems that people are already used to.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.360]   Yeah, you like Ajax.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.360]   This is Ajax, essentially.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.500]   A lot of people know how to program in JavaScript and CSS and stuff like that rather than having
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:19.040]   to learn Java or use a Java system or Objective-C or something like that.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.440]   Is there support, Dan, do you know for things like jQuery for some of the JavaScript libraries?
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   I don't know.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   I haven't played with it yet.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.440]   So I'll find out.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.640]   Do you use jQuery for your stuff?
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.640]   No.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.880]   The people I work with at SocialTechs use it a lot.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.160]   It's been really helpful for them.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:40.400]   But for my stuff, I've written it to run on its own so that I have a pretty clean system.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.840]   And the early versions of jQuery that I had were slowed things down a little bit and affected
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:49.960]   the recap that I was doing with my social software for the spreadsheet.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:54.360]   And I wanted it to run on really small systems like the OneLaptop, which it's running on
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   now.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.360]   Is it?
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:01.120]   Apparently, there are people in Nepal and in Colombia who are using my open source spreadsheet
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.160]   written in JavaScript to do real work.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.160]   So tell us about that.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.160]   I didn't know you'd done that.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.520]   You wrote a spreadsheet in JavaScript.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:15.320]   What I did was originally I had written a spreadsheet in Pearl that used a little bit
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:22.800]   of JavaScript and ran, it was called WikiCalc, and it's open source GPL that I released out
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   there.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:24.800]   And it used the browser somewhat.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.760]   But it was kind of clunky.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   And I started working with the guys at SocialText that have a commercial Wiki.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:37.680]   And so when trying to figure out how to do it right, I realized I really had to move
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.520]   the whole spreadsheet client side.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:47.560]   So I've reimplemented the whole thing as a JavaScript spreadsheet that lets you scroll
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.400]   around, you can have split planes.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.720]   It does a lot of the stuff that while you're editing is like what you can do with Google
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.640]   spreadsheets and came out around the same time.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.840]   But it doesn't need a backend to do the calculations and all.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.440]   And it handles very large spreadsheets compared to, I mean, it'll handle a thousand or more
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.000]   rows, 2,000 rows of data.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.800]   And people I think have already incorporated into Drupal.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:18.240]   And SocialText has been talking about it and they have it in limited beta to some other
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.920]   customers and we'll see what will happen over the next few months.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:27.920]   >> It's much more powerful than VisiCalk.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   It does a lot of the display that Excel did, let's say back in Excel 97.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.920]   You can do the different colors and formats.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.920]   >> Not pivot tables, nothing like that.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.920]   >> No, it doesn't have pivot tables.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:43.920]   I had not yet.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   >> That's okay because I still don't understand pivot tables.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.920]   >> Right, yes.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   But it has like 100 different functions and internal rate of return and all that stuff.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:59.920]   And it takes advantage of the browser in many ways.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   And now you can even cut and paste from Excel and it feels like a spreadsheet.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:13.920]   And the guys in SocialText are working to make it fit in really well with their commercial
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:20.920]   level wiki system so that you can calculate something that uses a sheet that's another
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.920]   page that's another page that's another page and does all the right roll-ups for you.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.920]   >> That's great.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   >> You have a URL that people can go check it out?
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.920]   >> Not yet.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.920]   Wait and see what SocialText does.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.920]   >> If you go to socialtext.net, you can actually find .com.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.920]   >> Yeah, they write it, they talk about it.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.920]   But you can't try it yet.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   You can actually download the one laptop version.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   And in fact, I think it's on a lot of the one laptops and running on your one laptop.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:59.920]   I think the version that I have listed under on softregarden.com about SocialCal.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.920]   I think you can download and play with it.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:02.920]   That's a much older version.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.920]   >> I'm seeing 1.1.0 at socialcalc.org.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.920]   >> Nah, that's a whole other thing.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   >> That's not it, huh?
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.920]   >> That was a Pearl version.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   >> That's the Pearl version.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.920]   >> Yeah, let's forget about that.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.920]   And you won't be able, I think it's not even there to click on it.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.920]   >> Oh, you're right.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.920]   >> You can download a wiki-calc and play with it.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.920]   >> But that's even older, right?
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   That's predates that.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.920]   Wait a little while.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.920]   I'll be posting some stuff.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.920]   I've just finished doing a lot of updates to it now when I do my recap.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   I have a little timer loop and it will, it lets you have very long recalculation.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.920]   You get progress bars underneath and stuff.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:45.920]   It can go out and ask for another sheet and another sheet and another sheet as it's rolling
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.920]   up in a big calculation.
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:52.920]   >> Where do you stand on the idea of software as a service or cloud computing?
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   >> They're different.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   >> They're different, but it's not clear.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   Okay, so first of all, tell me the difference.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   >> Well, the way I see it, I mean, I've been learning about this by listening to others talk
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.920]   about some of it and reading some books.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.920]   I think Amy Wall has a book about software as a service.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   It's pretty good that she publishes herself on Lulu.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.920]   Software as a service, yeah, it's like time sharing used to be.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:24.920]   We provide applications that actually run that you get through your browser or something of that sort.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:32.920]   And of course with AIR and Silverlight and stuff, we're able to do some pretty incredible applications.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   And JavaScript has just jumped everything up in terms of what we've been able to do,
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   but then we have Adobe AIR, et cetera.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   But if you have a full application, that's what I would call software as a service when you're getting it over the browser.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.920]   Cloud computing is, you go down a level.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   It's where there's a lot of the parts of running and the back end are available as a service.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:04.920]   So for example, Amazon gives you the ability to have storage as a service that you can take advantage of.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   And other places, let's say like SmugMug use their back end that's provided in the Internet for storage.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   They actually use Amazon, I think.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:16.920]   They actually use Amazon's, right, yes, they use S3.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:17.920]   They use the Amazon storage.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.920]   SmugMug uses that, which is using taking advantage of cloud computing.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   But cloud computing has different things that could be available on demand in the cloud that you can just get when you need it, that it's not yours.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   You're using it as a service, but it's usually a service in service of the thing that you're doing.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:43.920]   So they also provide, Amazon also provides you just plain CPUs running an operating system like Linux.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   So you can have web browsers and you can fire them up just by saying, "Give me one."
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   It's not yours.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:50.920]   You're just using it as a service.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:58:00.920]   And then there are other services you could provide like credit card services and I think Google's starting to provide a variety of services in the back end.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   And would you view Google Maps taking advantage of some of the things Google Maps does?
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   Is that software as a service or is that cloud computing?
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   Well, that's where the confusion lies.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.920]   The line is blurred for sure.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   I was just recently in Holland and went to a meeting of the cloud computing folks that had this club, a SIG.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:29.920]   And they're arguments that they're using now, I think Dan kind of touches on it.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   But it boils down to kind of the following as one guy told me.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.920]   He says, "There's a lot of big companies that are getting sick and tired of their IT department."
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   -Yes. -period.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.920]   Yes.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   And they just want to get them, they just want to fire them all, but they can't quite do that, but what they can do is,
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:54.920]   move to the cloud and let these, you know, like a professional IT department that is not so meddlesome, run the back end of their operation.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.920]   And that would be...
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.920]   That is a sad statement.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.920]   Or one piece of the operation is the piece you may not want to be the person who takes care of the storage.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.920]   -Right. -You know, and you don't want to buy racks of storage.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   You don't know how much you're going to need.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   And you may have, we're temporarily, you need a lot.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   And then for a while, you know, let's say around Christmas time, you need an awful lot for some reason.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   And then, you know, after the big buying season, you don't need it.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   Why buy all that stuff when you can sort of rent it from Amazon or somebody else?
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:28.920]   So you're bullish on cloud computing/soft versus surface.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.920]   -Yeah, well, I mean, it's time sharing.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   It's like, I mean, this stuff is... -Well, I mean, I think that's John's objection to it, is that it's time sharing.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.920]   So? It might... -Well, so is a big...
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.920]   It's kind of a bigoted thing to say.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:53.920]   I think the thing is what I complain about is not so much software as a service or cloud computing for a large corporation that wants to outsource its IT department because it just can't take it anymore.
[00:59:53.920 --> 01:00:04.920]   I'm just complaining about the individual who starts to rely too much on offsite mechanical, you know, or offsite software or offsite storage.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:11.920]   When you buy a terabyte drive at Costco for $89, and you got plenty of storage, you don't need to put your photos online.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:16.920]   I mean, a lot of people have put their photos, and I have no objection to smug mug and all these companies.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.920]   -I mean, I keep a local copy, but I put it on smug mug.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   -Yeah, a lot of people use these different systems.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   And it's fine. It gives it one way of distributing at least thumbnails.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.920]   I mean, but now it isn't.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.920]   -I don't know that I put the raw files up there on there.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   -It's just the side. How long is it to take it?
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920]   Well, you're sitting... Okay.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.920]   You're sitting on... Let's remind people.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.920]   -I'm sitting on a bandwidth. -On a 10-megabit per second.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.920]   -I don't use that, though, for the young building. I mean, I don't do stuff. That means it takes a while, but it takes...
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   I do it at home.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.920]   -I have five, I mean, because I have files here. I mean, we're going to have it like that.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:46.920]   -Yes.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.920]   -The thing is, John, I think I agree you should keep your own copy.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.920]   It is so cheap to be able to do that, but it's also good to be able to have it up there.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   But a lot of this, if you think of from a company viewpoint where they do have needs the change, being able to take advantage of more than you have whenever you want to.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   -You have whenever you want extra to have that extra stuff being able to get it out in the cloud is a nice thing.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.920]   -Yeah, no, I'm not going to argue that.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.920]   -Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   -I'm not going to argue the fact that it's nice to have off-site storage in case your house burns down.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   -But it's not relying on the cloud. It's a secondary.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.920]   -That's what I object to.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.920]   -Yes.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   -I think you're right, because I mean, we see all the problems when these things go down.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   You really need a way to not have a single point of failure.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.920]   -I'll give you an example, because my kids high school, I was talking to them about technology.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:39.920]   It's a very expensive thing for a school to invest in hardware and software that gets obsolete much more quickly than they'd like it to be.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   It adds up, whereas they could do a lot of this stuff, instead of buying Microsoft Office, they could use Google Docs or Zoho Office.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   What's wrong with that?
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   -Yeah.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   -I mean, isn't that a better way to go?
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.920]   -For some things, sometimes.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.920]   -Yeah, I mean, there are times when it's right, there's a time for this and a time for that.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.920]   -A time for this.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.920]   -And John's right.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.920]   There's sometimes when it's wrong, and sometimes it's right.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.920]   And the trick is knowing when to use the right thing.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.920]   And things change over time.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.920]   Something that used to be right may be wrong.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   And I mean, that's one of the things to get into my book.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920]   Things evolve.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   And I think people have to understand how a lot of this stuff evolves over time.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   Ideas that were bad ideas in the old days may be good today, and vice versa.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   -How many of us rely on Gmail these days?
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   -That's cloud computing.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   -Yeah.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.920]   -I want to actually get back, circle around to the pre with you, Dan, in just a bit.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   And talk a little bit about that, but I want to also take a break right now.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.920]   So, John, if you want to base your meat, go right into it.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   -I'm going to go based.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   -When we do this on Sunday afternoon, and John often is cooking, I guess he gets the cooking
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.920]   detail on Sunday, if Dan, if you want to go base to your meat, you may as well.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   -Well, I want to mention audible.com.
