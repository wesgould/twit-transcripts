[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.540]   He was clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking and finally...
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.540]   [ Sound Effects ]
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.700]   John, Corey Doctorow on the line with us.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.700]   Hey, John.
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.700]   Hey.
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.900]   And Steve Steckelow from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   Hi, greetings.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.900]   He's a former geek cruiser.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.900]   Heh.
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.660]   Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.660]   He was there for work.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.660]   That's right.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.660]   It was an assignment.
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.540]   So Corey, do you not want me to mention that you have a baby on the way?
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.540]   Is that a private?
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.000]   So I had to mention it, I've put it in my podcast and that people have put two and two together
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.280]   with all the more baby stuff I've been blogging.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.280]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.840]   So I'm like getting feeds for like baby gadget and geek dad and all the baby sites.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.960]   There's a lot of babies happening.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.960]   It's a little weird.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.760]   Well, so you know, like Finland, the last time Finland's population didn't decline, it
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.560]   was nine months after a TV strike that happened over winter.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.840]   So I'm convinced that nine months ago, like the internet got slower.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.440]   And now we're seeing this bumper crop emerge.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.820]   If nothing else to do, I guess we could conceive.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.820]   Why not?
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.820]   That's right.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.820]   It's like the nine months after the New York Blackouts.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.820]   There was a little bomb.
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.820]   Right, baby boom.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.340]   Well, Alex had, Alex and Carly have had theirs.
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.340]   Patrick's had his.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.540]   Merlin's had his.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.380]   Merlin really dropped off the face of the map.
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.740]   I guess you're going to kind of do that, Corey, a little bit.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.740]   I'm going to go dark.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.820]   Well, not entirely dark, but pretty dark.
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.600]   I'm going to, well, I'm no more traveling for a while, which is like a huge thing for
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   me.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.560]   This period I finished last Sunday and I'm not traveling between now and February 28th.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.080]   And that's the longest period I've had without getting on an airplane since 1995.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   Lord.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   And you've.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.240]   And so you were in LA the last time we talked that fellowship and or you just decided to
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.240]   come to the.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.240]   Yeah, no, I was on a one year Fulbright.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.240]   So that's over.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.280]   I'm actually in the process of getting us visa again so I can start traveling to come
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280]   and do speeches and stuff.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.640]   And that's like 10,000 bucks to get that visa.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   What?
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.900]   America is the only Western country in the world that requires you to have a visa to
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.500]   show up and like give a talk at a conference or, you know, do a days consulting work.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   That's actually hurt us.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.260]   I know there are a lot of open source guys who will not come to the States and they
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260]   don't have a one-time thing on the Linux conferences here anymore.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.820]   The World Science Fiction Convention is like, you know, six years, five years out of six
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.500]   as being held abroad, which is like completely unheard of.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.540]   It's in Denver next year, but it was in like Japan and Glasgow and just like anywhere
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.820]   you don't have to be fingerprinted by the DHS.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.740]   Hey, we should be rolling tape on this.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.940]   This is like more interesting than our typical Mac chat.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.700]   John, why don't you think I'm rolling tape on this?
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.780]   I don't like they didn't let Kat Stevenson, you know, claiming he was a terrorist.
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.780]   You said he's lost.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.780]   He is.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.780]   Have you ever heard his music?
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.780]   That's good.
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.980]   He runs a he runs in an Islamic school in London.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.300]   I think he's pretty kosher.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.300]   Well, that's not.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.300]   I hear that.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.860]   I hear that they've got a whole classroom full of like light brights and those kids are learning
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.340]   to improvise little light bright designs all day.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.620]   The whole city of Boston is at risk for so long as Kat Stevens is running his training
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.620]   camp in London.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.620]   Let me tell everybody who's on the phone with us before we get going.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.460]   John C. Devorak.org/blog is here and I've been going to devorak.org/blog and looking
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.460]   all the way.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.460]   We're probably posting a lot of videos these days, John.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.780]   Hey, you know, I got to apologize.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.660]   Well, I'll apologize after you introduce everybody else.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660]   Okay.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.860]   You want to apologize for them or your blog?
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.460]   No, I'm not going to the blog.
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.460]   The blog's fantastic.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.460]   Of course it is.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.620]   No, I'm going to apologize for what happened to West Virginia.
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.820]   Oh, no.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.540]   Oh, dear.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.820]   Well also here, Mr. Steve Steklow from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.860]   Steve has been on to it before.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.380]   Last time was on a boat.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.380]   That's right.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.380]   We got him on dry land today.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.380]   That's right.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.260]   Steve, it's going to have you.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.020]   Steve, just last weekend, wrote a very interesting piece on the OLPC.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.940]   He's been making the media rounds talking about Nick Negropodie's project to put cheap
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.260]   laptops in the hands of his developing world.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.420]   We'll talk about that because it's constantly developing story.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.020]   It's become a huge story, particularly how Intel and Microsoft kind of started to horn
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.100]   in on the whole thing.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.180]   From London, England, the world's newest daddy blogger.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.180]   Corey.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.180]   Corey Doctorow.
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.180]   Corey.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.180]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.180]   Hey, how are you going?
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.180]   Is this two points?
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.180]   Two points?
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.180]   One blog.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.180]   Two points?
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.180]   One blog.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.180]   I like it.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.060]   Is Bling Bling going to start having some kids stuff on it too?
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.980]   Well, we got some more than, you know, we've had more in the last year to, you know, David
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.580]   Pescobets had a kid a little while ago and Mark's got two little kids.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.600]   So we do have a fair bit of it, but I've started to blog more baby stuff.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.540]   I'm reading the baby gadget sites.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.100]   Babygadget.com's a pretty good site and picking up some good stuff there.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.420]   And my Pat, as they say in Australia, my fiance has also been picking up a lot of good
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.460]   stuff that I've been picking up from her.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.980]   You got to go to Paranhacks too.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.980]   That's Paranhacks.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.980]   Absolutely.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.980]   Ashadorn.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.980]   I mean, her, she's awesome.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.980]   She's a palomine.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.180]   I stay with her in rail whenever I'm in Portland.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.620]   Portland, stay with rail and Ashadorn.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.420]   We can put a little billboard at the end of every show.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.700]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.580]   We do a, we've, we started a few weeks ago, a few months ago, I guess now, a parenting
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.060]   podcast on, on Twitter.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.860]   And I think it's because there's so many people in the tech industry now who are hitting their
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.820]   thirties and starting to have kids.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.500]   I keep saying it was that big internet outage nine months ago, led to the baby boom.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.060]   There was no outage on Thanksgiving day.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.460]   It turns out online experts are saying the busiest day of the year, not Black Friday,
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.220]   not Cyber Monday Thanksgiving day itself.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.980]   That's when everybody goes online to buy.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.980]   That's surprising.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.980]   I guess doesn't surprise me.
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.980]   Everybody has high speed internet now.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.380]   And you got to do something once the family really starts to get to you.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.980]   Quick run to the computer.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.820]   You know, the best, the best Thanksgiving thing I ever saw was that year that the Mozilla
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.500]   Foundation ran a little campaign that was like go home and install Firefox on your
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.780]   parents computer this weekend.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.820]   And I think that, you know, how you like change the batteries and your fire alarm on, you
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.780]   know, on leap forward and fall back day.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.020]   I think like Thanksgiving day should be the day you go home and like formally read it like
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.260]   a little pack of like update your parents virus definitions, give them Firefox update
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:21.320]   there, open office, put the new mirror on install, install the new bunch who tell them
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   it's Vista.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.220]   It'd be awesome.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.340]   I think it's a very good though.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.700]   Let's let's start that right now.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.700]   New initiative.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.460]   Well, we've got a year to prepare for it.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.180]   Online sites Walmart Best Buy and Circuit City, biggest share of online traffic.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.180]   Thanksgiving.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.420]   Amazon was busiest on Monday.
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.460]   I don't know if that says something about Walmart Best Buy, Circuit City and Amazon
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.460]   seems to.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.460]   All right.
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.460]   Same say, say something.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.780]   I don't know what exactly it says at the smart money.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.540]   Wait till Monday, right?
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.580]   Hey, let's talk about Steve's article because I think this is a really big story and very
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.260]   interesting story.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:05.100]   The OLPC, the arc was in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday last.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.340]   Nick Negropati's kind of responded to it as well.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.180]   Steve, what's going on?
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:17.060]   I actually was on the radio with him on I guess it was Thursday and he in that interview
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:24.020]   with NPR, he said that he didn't he didn't view Intel where Microsoft was competition,
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.980]   which I thought was kind of interesting given that in my story, it disclosed that he had
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:35.900]   asked the CEO of Intel to stop selling their laptop overseas, the classmate.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.980]   But basically what's going on is this story started out as essentially a follow up to one
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:48.060]   I did two years ago, which was not long after he first announced the $100 laptop at the
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.060]   World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:56.940]   And quite soon it got a lot of attention and a lot of big players soon signed up, including
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:06.500]   AMD and Newscore and eventually eBay and Google and a whole lot of them.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:14.540]   And for a while, it looked like he was greatly respected by everyone and all his, it was
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.300]   a great philanthropic idea, which I think it is.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:25.380]   But there were some companies, most notably Intel and Microsoft, who were quite openly
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.500]   hostile to this.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.260]   And Craig Barrett, the chairman of Intel, started attacking the machine, Negropani's
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:39.420]   idea of a machine as a gadget, a $100 gadget and Bill Gates later made sort of similar
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.660]   remarks about it.
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:49.580]   And what happened was Intel in mid-2006 introduced a laptop computer called the classmate.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:55.140]   Now Intel is a chip maker and they don't normally sell computers at all.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.900]   But they introduced this machine, it's only sold in developing countries.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:05.300]   It's currently going for about $230 to $300.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:11.260]   And Mr. Negropani's machine, which was supposed to cost $100, that was the goal, ends up costing
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:17.180]   a lot more because he did not achieve the economies of scale that were required.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:23.740]   His strategy was to find six countries and sell them each a minimum of one million machines.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.300]   And he flew around the world meeting with leaders of many countries, including Colonel
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.020]   Gaddafi and Libya, for example.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.140]   And he got essentially handshake promises from a number of these countries to buy a
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.140]   million.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:41.860]   The problem was it took quite a while to sort of design and produce this machine, which
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.860]   only went into mass production just last month.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.980]   And by the time he did that, for example, the leader of Thailand who he had a deal with
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.380]   was no longer in office because he'd been overthrown in a military coup.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.140]   The president of Thailand was no longer the president of Thailand.
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.740]   And a lot of the deals began to unravel.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:07.860]   And the biggest problem, I think, for him is that as the price went up, and it's now
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:15.020]   up to about $188, that sort of brought him into the realm of Windows traditional laptop
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.420]   machines that run Windows that have come down in price.
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.140]   Now, part of the reason they've come down in price is because he really created an incentive.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:29.900]   When he first announced this in early '05, the laptops cost $600 and up.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:35.340]   And now suddenly you're seeing machines for $400 and below that.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:41.460]   And you're beginning to see machines offered in the developing world for as little as $200,
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.940]   which suddenly puts them in direct competition with his machine.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:53.100]   Now Intel has really been very aggressive in going after Negropani and OLPC.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:58.420]   In country after country that he was counting on, they've been marketing very heavily,
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.580]   direct head-to-head comparisons with his machine, declaring that the classmates better.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.260]   And a lot of these countries, they look at the two machines and they see one that's
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:16.380]   made by a giant corporation with $35 billion in annual revenue versus a little nonprofit
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.260]   out of MIT with 20 people and a budget of about $9.5 million.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:28.100]   And they say, well, which one's going to provide us with after sale support?
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.860]   Which one's going to be there if something breaks?
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:37.620]   And so by and large, they're going towards Intel.
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.180]   Which actually seems sensible.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.940]   What does happen if you break an OLPC?
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.940]   You're not going to go back.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.940]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.580]   What would it change anything if they sold a machine with a garbage can that came with
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.580]   it?
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.460]   So when something happened to it, they could just throw it out?
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.460]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.620]   Oh, yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.020]   You're no fan of it.
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:01.420]   I think that if the OLPC was well and truly rolled out, that this question of what you
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.780]   do with it, when it breaks, would be you fix it.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.820]   And actually what this would do is create a national industry around the world of people
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.060]   who fixed it.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.100]   And the problem with the head-to-head comparisons, the OLPCs and the Intel's, is that they don't
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.980]   really-- the OLPC is supposed to be a process and not a product.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:22.460]   It's meant to have all these affordances and design elements that make it a learning
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.460]   tool.
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.020]   One of those is that it's supposed to be easily taken apart and repaired and put back together
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.620]   again by the people who use it.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.620]   Right.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.060]   In fact, his plan all along was to train the kids and not the teachers and have the children
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.500]   be able to fix them and that they would supply them with spare parts or whatever.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.460]   And I think that's possible.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.940]   But it's clear that there was some naivete involved on his part.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.620]   One of his big problems, I think, was this top-down approach of going after the leaders
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:56.380]   of the country and pretty much ignoring the bureaucrats like in the ministries of education
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:01.300]   who actually make the budgetary decisions as to whether to buy these machines.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.980]   And many of them, they're familiar with the traditional Windows machines.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.660]   And when Push came to shove, they seemed to be siding with those machines.
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:14.540]   So I think that it's in theory what he's saying makes a lot of sense.
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:19.380]   But when you're in a bidding process, and one company says, "Well, we're going to--
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:24.060]   like Intel, we're going to train 150,000 teachers in Nigeria."
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.700]   And Mr. Negropani's group is saying, "Well, we don't need to train teachers at all because
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.140]   the kids will teach the teachers."
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.780]   I don't think it's all that surprising that Nigeria just recently signed a big contract
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.260]   to buy Intel machines.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.740]   Microsoft's got a $3 version of Windows, too.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.700]   Well, that's the other thing.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:49.100]   Bill Gates, who had made fun of the OLC machine even before it came out, announced in Beijing
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.740]   in April that they were going to start selling Windows for $3.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:58.820]   It's not just Windows, it's Microsoft Office with Windows and some other programs.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.700]   I mean, you're talking hundreds of dollars with the programs that are only available
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.580]   in developing countries.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:10.940]   And Negropani said at a meeting in April that this was a direct response to him.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.860]   Now, I interviewed someone at Microsoft who claimed it wasn't.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.340]   But the fact of the matter is, it is hurting him.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.460]   I mean, he's had a very sort of odd relationship with Microsoft.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.580]   He says he's been showing this every day.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.740]   He says he knows Bill Gates.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.380]   He's been keeping Microsoft up to date on what's going on.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.940]   Well, this is the...
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.180]   Unfortunately, there's been a lot of misreporting in the press, I think, about this.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.380]   It came out earlier this year.
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.380]   Microsoft said, "Yes."
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.860]   Well, first of all, Negropani has claimed the thing runs Windows.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.900]   But then when if you ask, "Well, how well does it run Windows?"
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.900]   He doesn't really...
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.900]   They don't really tell you.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.460]   I spoke with Microsoft and they said, "Yes, we're trying to put Windows on it, but we
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.580]   don't know when that's going to happen."
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.460]   And then when I talked to OLPC, those guys buy in large heat Windows.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.460]   Yeah, who wants to put Windows on it anyway?
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.980]   It seems like counter to the whole idea.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.980]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.620]   Well, they're very big open source people at OLPC.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.860]   And Walter Bender, who runs the software shop there, told me he would resign if they
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.860]   replaced Linux as the core operating system with Windows.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.780]   And Negropani told me that 80% of his people would quit.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.540]   So they're not really pushing it to run Windows.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.100]   The claims that it does run Windows is sort of bogus.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.180]   When I talked to Microsoft that despite a report recently from a news agency that the
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.020]   thing was imminently going to run Windows, they told me they have no idea when it's going
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.180]   to run or even if it can run it.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.940]   And Walter Bender told me that there were big licensing problems that Microsoft confirmed
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:47.340]   with me between the open source design of the machine and Microsoft software.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:53.180]   So the current version of the machine that just came out that they're selling now, it's
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.780]   very unlikely, I think, that it's ever going to run Windows.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.700]   Well, let me play devil's advocate here.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.900]   Maybe this is all he's done what he wanted to do, which was to get the big E's to come
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.580]   up with cheap computers.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.260]   So now laptops are available.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.260]   There's choice available.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.500]   Why does it have to be OLPC?
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.060]   Court, does it have to be open source?
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:16.460]   Well, this isn't the first time that Microsoft has sold very low cost or tried to sell very
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.700]   low cost or free versions of their products in the developing world.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.500]   They tried it in Brazil where a very good guy named Sergio Amadeo is in the culture
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.860]   ministry there and is the guy who set up the telecentros, which are the open source
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.780]   computer labs and the slums and the favelas.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:36.180]   He rejected the offer of free Microsoft software and opted for really free software, software
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.500]   that's free as in speech and free as in beer, Linux and so on.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:46.260]   And when Microsoft did the smear campaign against him, like Idiot Burekrat refuses free
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:51.060]   valuable software from the rich north, he said, "Well, there's a reason I refused it.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.340]   It's because Microsoft has a drug dealer business model.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.260]   The first taste is free."
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.420]   And they sued him for corporate libel.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.660]   And he said, "Okay, let's go to court.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:07.060]   I want to hear you in a Brazilian court defend the principle that you are not engaged in
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.340]   a drug dealer business model."
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.900]   And Microsoft dropped the suit.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:16.260]   So I think that it is great if these products are available at lower cost in the developing
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.260]   world.
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.740]   I think that the biggest miscalculation, maybe that Negroponte made around Intel, was to
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:27.940]   imagine that Intel would not be so shameless as to go up against a nonprofit public spirited
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.220]   project just because it used their competitors' chips.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.460]   When I was at the UN, the World Blind Union helped launch a treaty at the World Intellectual
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.700]   Property Organization to protect the rights of blind people to access books and other
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.860]   material.
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.020]   And they did this partly on the grounds that they knew that you would sound like such
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.380]   a total jerk if you said, "No, I object to the treaty for giving blind people access
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.380]   to books."
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.820]   And yet, it was amazing to watch the World Publishers Association stand up and say, "Although
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.660]   we support the objectives of this treaty, we have grave doubts, and trying not to sound
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.260]   like, "Ah, screw the blind."
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.620]   And I think that he mis-underestimated it.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.980]   I think he underestimated Intel's willingness to go out and say, "Ah, screw that, screw
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.980]   that developing nation's nonprofit project.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.620]   We're here to turn a buck."
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.020]   Well, what's interesting with the Intel thing, which I haven't mentioned is they had this
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:26.820]   big sort of verbal public spat that went on for close to a year and a half.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:33.100]   Then it culminated with an appearance Negroponte made on 60 Minutes where they, again, they
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:40.260]   lashed out at Intel and Leslie still confronts Craig Barrett with some marketing documentation
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:46.020]   from Nigeria in which they compared the machines head to head and she pulls this out and sort
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.740]   of embarrasses him.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:53.620]   And two months later, Intel in effect jumps into bed with Negroponte by joining a LPC's
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:58.180]   board and giving a multi-million dollar donation to the nonprofit.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:02.180]   And suddenly, there were stories that this was a great victory for Negroponte.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.780]   The problem and the one thing our story reported was that they also signed a non-disclosure,
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:13.020]   a non-disparagement agreement so that they both agreed not to attack one and a publicly
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.020]   again.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.020]   That's gives you.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.420]   So the problem was, there was nothing in there but nothing in the agreement that said
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:24.380]   that Intel would stop marketing its laptop, the classmate, and it's continued to do so
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.740]   extremely aggressively.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.740]   Right.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.740]   It's been a...
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.180]   I have to say though, in some ways, this has been a successful...
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.820]   The OLPC project has been successful.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.260]   They're selling, they say, $2 million worth of laptops a day to the public.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.620]   This buy one, get one, buy one, give one program has been...
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.980]   Sounds like fairly successful.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.820]   Well, they sold half the machines were sold the first day.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.100]   I mean, it's declined since then.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.460]   The numbers, they've been saying $2 million a day for a long time now.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.340]   But that's really all happening at the beginning.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.100]   And they did extend it.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.940]   It was only supposed to be for two weeks.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.340]   And on Thanksgiving day, they extended it till the end of the year.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:08.820]   So, I mean, and the bottom line is that the numbers, even if they've sold $2 million a
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:14.660]   day, he was predicting that he would sell $100 to $150 million by 2008.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.660]   Right.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.980]   By 2008 and that by 2007 right now, he would have sold over $3 million.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.540]   He sold like a tenth of that even with these numbers.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.060]   That's because people have pulled out of deals.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:31.380]   Now, Hayawatha Bray writes in the Globe yesterday that the orders are surging and they have
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.380]   made some deals.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.380]   The government purr of a peruse purchased 260,000 machines.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.220]   Well, our story had mentioned that he was on the verge of doing a deal with Peru.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:45.180]   But again, if you add the numbers up, you're only talking about the low a few hundred thousand
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.180]   not millions.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.180]   Millions.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.100]   Millions that he needs to bring the cost down to $100.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.140]   He can't do that without selling.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.780]   He has said this many times.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:02.500]   He needs to sell like five or six or eight million to be able to pressure the suppliers
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   to lower the parts prices.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.660]   There's something like 600 different parts to this thing.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.860]   He can't get it down.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.420]   As long as he can't get it down, he's going to have trouble, I think.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:21.220]   Now, I have to say that I think he does deserve a huge amount of credit for creating a marketplace
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.740]   in the developing world for these machines and getting the big companies to think about
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.540]   it, which they hadn't really before.
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:37.420]   I asked him, how would you feel if all these countries end up buying from Intel?
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.020]   He said he would still consider it a success.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:46.220]   Having said that, it's hard to believe that he's spent, after spending several years developing
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:53.460]   a unique machine that by virtually all accounts is very innovative, that that was all for
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.460]   not.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.340]   I definitely sense the disappointment.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:04.420]   If Nagrapani really doesn't view Intel as a competitor but is welcoming them, why did
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:12.420]   he ask Adalini, the CEO of Intel, this past month in November to stop selling the classmate?
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.780]   He literally demanded that and Intel refused.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.860]   Now the deal is they've reached some new agreement where they're supposedly working on a new
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:28.180]   machine that they want to introduce by the Consumer Electronics Show in January.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:35.260]   This is an Intel-powered OLPC machine, which obviously AMD is not going to be very happy
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.620]   about, given that they've been in this thing since the beginning.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:46.860]   It creates a whole other dynamic to this, which I think will make the story interesting for
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.860]   quite some time.
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.740]   I've got two free pieces of advice for OLPC if they want to stay in the game.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:58.340]   The first would be to redesign the machine so that it can be gracefully decomposed into
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.020]   parts that can be folded back into the manufacturing stream.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:07.340]   Right now, e-waste is mostly processed by children who are largely killed by dealing
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.340]   with it.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:14.660]   The sad truth is that the classmate and the OLPC, its end of life is to end up in these
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.740]   Chinese decomposition cities where eight-year-olds toil over a vats of acid until they die, taking
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.740]   a part e-waste.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.620]   Redesign this thing so that it's easy to fold back in the manufacturing stream.
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:31.420]   Then without disparaging Intel, just run a lot of footage of children dying decomposing
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.660]   machines and say, "And ours doesn't do this."
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:39.580]   You don't have to say anything about the classmate, just make that one of the checkboxes, right?
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:45.100]   Does your machine kill children by the thousands when it is at its end of life?
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.260]   And none of the other ones will be able to say yes.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:52.460]   The other one is to sell the OLPC outside of the US on their buy one give one.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.460]   I can't buy one.
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.460]   I live in London.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.820]   I just think it's crazy that a global project is only selling in the US.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.900]   You have to move to Canada.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.900]   You can buy one there.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.540]   Yeah, well, I'm from Canada.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.460]   I can have a ship out of my parents or something.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.980]   Go home to Toronto and pick one up.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.500]   I actually love to get one.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.740]   I think they look very cool.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.740]   I was surprised to...
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.980]   I listened to the interview that you and Negropani did on NPR.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.140]   I was surprised to hear that it still comes with the crank.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.700]   I thought they had abandoned the crank.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.500]   No, I was really upset about that.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.620]   I was very diplomatic and I didn't go after him.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:28.540]   But what the story said was that the early prototype that Kofi Annan showed in Tunisia
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:34.020]   in the fall of 2005 had a hand crank that was attached to the side...
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.700]   to the screen.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.460]   Not only was that scrapped, but Negropani had a meeting I went to and heard him say this.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.740]   He called attaching that crank to the side of the screen utterly absurd.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.860]   They got rid of it.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.180]   It was completely impractical.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.580]   They got rid of it right after.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.380]   The problem was that image of the machine with the hand stuck with the public.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.020]   It became like an icon.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:03.340]   Now, what he said on NPR was, "Well, it still works with a hand crank, but it's not the
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.940]   same hand crank."
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.340]   It doesn't come with the machine.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:13.980]   I thought that was really not very accurate.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:19.500]   What I saw in April was what powers the thing is a type of a device with a pull string on
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.620]   it, almost like a lawn mower.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.820]   You pull and pull.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.780]   Those actually work better and more efficiently than cranks because they use a flywheel to
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.780]   do that.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:28.780]   I've actually seen it.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.820]   I was surprised to hear him say that it still runs the crank.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:38.260]   I've actually held and fondled and played with an EXO as well, which is the model name
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.620]   of those machines.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:45.500]   They've got that feel of a genuinely awesome new piece of technology that I felt the first
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.380]   time someone handed me a K-Pro.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.140]   I was like, "Wow, having used Apple II Plus for several years and then seeing a machine
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.460]   that however unwieldy you could pick it up and carry it around."
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.820]   I was like, "This is the beginning of a totally different way of using computers."
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.180]   I felt that way when I played with the EXO.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.060]   One of the most deepest hackers I know is John Gilmore.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:12.580]   You like Koro, GCC, and EMAX and a whole bunch of other really important stuff.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.340]   Co-founded EFF and wrote Solaris and all that stuff or wrote parts of Solaris.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.460]   He's been using an EXO, I think exclusively now, for months.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.900]   He swears by it.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.860]   He's not just a very small hands.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.340]   He's very nimble as our John.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.180]   I bought an Asus Eepc.
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.340]   I like this idea of a small form factor light piece.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.340]   See how it's pronounced?
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.340]   I thought it was pronounced E.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.180]   Actually, I think it's pronounced E, but nobody knows what you're talking about when
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.180]   you say the E.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.180]   It is pronounced E.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.620]   I called it triply in Microsoft who's working with them, corrected me and said it's just
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.620]   the E.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.180]   Well, it runs Linux and it's a nice little computer.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.660]   Of course, my dog ate my power adapter, so I haven't used it in a while.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.020]   It runs Windows 2, right?
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.820]   You could put Windows XP on it, absolutely.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.980]   I think we should call it the E.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.940]   So the question is, is the EXO competitive with that?
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:05.860]   Exo's running Linux and then a squeak e-toy interface on top of it.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.900]   That's another competitor that's come along.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:16.220]   Microsoft told me they have a big deal in Russia to sell hundreds of thousands of E machines
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.980]   with Windows on it.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:23.500]   Now, the E machine that you have Leo that's sold in the States for, I think it's $399.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:29.580]   But, as Sestek is talking about having a kind of a cheaper version for the developing world
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.620]   that'll be as low as $200.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.420]   And that one is aimed squarely at the OLPC machine.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:41.860]   And they're beginning to enter some of the markets that Negroponte is competing in.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.860]   Right, right.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.860]   But that's a much more traditional machine, right?
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:45.860]   Absolutely.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.860]   It's cheap.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.860]   It's got Wi-Fi.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:48.860]   It doesn't have a crank.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.860]   It doesn't have a pull string.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.780]   I think what Corey is talking about, like, one thing that's great about the OLPC machine
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.780]   is the screen.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.780]   It's amazing.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.100]   Like, I saw it in direct sunlight.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.540]   We held it by a window and you can read it perfectly clearly.
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.620]   I mean, they really did a great job with that.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.460]   It's not backlit, or is it?
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.460]   Is it backlit?
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.780]   I think it has a backlit mode, doesn't it?
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.780]   It can go either.
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.780]   It's like, it's expensive.
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.980]   It can go either monochrome or color.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:19.100]   But at the same time, somehow it's got a reflective technology that the sunlight seems
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.100]   to have no effect.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.180]   It's very, very bright in sunlight.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.180]   Well, you still get one.
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.180]   We'll just wait if you're...
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.380]   You can get one to the end of the year.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.180]   It's $3.99.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.660]   You get one and a child gets one.
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:34.340]   I guess the ones that this program generates are going to countries like Rwanda where...
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.340]   And Haiti.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.300]   And Haiti where there's no money at all, no government money to buy these.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.300]   That's right.
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.300]   Well, no government in the case of Rwanda.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.300]   No government at all.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.300]   That's right.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.740]   You know, I've seen these rolled out at places like Turkcon, the Hacker Conference in San Diego.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:54.580]   And just like everybody who just who touches one just lets at this kind of little nerd
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.700]   gasm side, you know, like they just...
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.700]   It is a really sweet piece of hardware.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.540]   Would that be a way to jump-start it to keep the program going if everybody said, "Let's
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.540]   buy them.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.540]   Let's get it going."
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.140]   Is that enough, I guess, to say?
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.860]   I think it might be enough to like capture the public imagination.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.340]   I think part of the problem is that until you've held one and seen kids play with them.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.900]   Actually, I think a huge thing.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:23.780]   My initial suggestion to them for the Christmas campaign was to sell each rich person, three
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.780]   of them.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:25.780]   Right.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.780]   So you paid for three.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.780]   Yep.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:33.020]   One would go to a poor kid in your state and one would go to a poor kid overseas.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.020]   Great idea.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.980]   And I thought that that would be like an amazing way to make this matter at home.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.980]   Except that we need to admit that there's poverty in the US and I don't know if you can.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.820]   But no, but you know, they have another program now called Give Many.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.900]   You guys are talking about it as the Give One, Get One.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:52.060]   But we also have one called Give Many where you actually can go out from them and do a
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:56.540]   direct purchase of something like $100, you know, $10,000 even.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:01.700]   In fact, to get the price low, you got to buy a huge quantity because if you do anything
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.420]   under $100, I think it's $300 a unit.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.340]   But you can use these and then an outfit, you know, a school with them.
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:15.620]   So there's a school in Alabama that supposedly is going to be buying 29 or 30,000 of these
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.340]   through this other program.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:23.420]   So they won't stop you right now from buying a large quantity and giving it to kids in
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.420]   the States.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.420]   Laptop giving.org.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.980]   Let me give a plug for it just so people know they can go to laptopgiving.org and find
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.340]   out more about this.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:38.100]   I just think that getting them used by kids right around, you know, right around where
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.100]   you live is a great way to make it matter to you as opposed to like something that happens
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.380]   in some distant land.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.860]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.340]   You know, people just got to touch it.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.860]   The color TV, the way that it was brought to Britain is this guy Ludlam.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:54.900]   He imported 50,000 of them and knocked on people's doors and said, "I will give you this color
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.380]   TV free, but I'll come back in a week.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.300]   And if you still want it, you have to pay me for it.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.220]   Otherwise, I'm taking it away again."
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.380]   Like he introduced color TV to Britain.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:07.100]   Once you've got one in your living room, it becomes a lot less theoretical.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:11.620]   And incidentally, his kids, the Ludlam brothers, are the guys who started Promise TV, which
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:16.020]   is this PBR that'll store six months worth of everything on the air.
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.220]   They're all like giant be hackers.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.540]   They'd store the whole free view multiplex is one big role.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.380]   And they've got the whole role from July 7th from the day of the bombings in London.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.780]   And you can roll all 30 channels forward in sync and you can go up and down the dial
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.660]   and watch all of TV respond in real time.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:40.100]   Like the channel that just shows reruns of Doctor Who suddenly breaks into a newscast.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.180]   And then like, and here's the BBC's coverage.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.260]   And as the BBC was saying this, what was Channel 4 saying?
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.940]   It's an amazing piece of technology.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.940]   Fascinating.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.460]   How big a hard drive is in that thing?
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.460]   That's fast.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.860]   It's a whole whack of hard drives.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:56.060]   The six month one they built for the BBC experimentally and they've got like a two week one that
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.860]   they're planning to market commercially.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:58.860]   What a great idea.
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.660]   Make sure you pay your licensing fee over that.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.020]   Yeah, yeah, you're 120 pounds a year and you get the whole free to free to air multiplex
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:10.820]   PVRs here are in some ways way cooler than in the States because the in the US the directory
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.060]   information the electronic programming guide is expensive and proprietary.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.820]   And here it's actually in band.
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.500]   There's a digital electronic programming guide that's transmitted over the air that your
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.740]   device can get.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:26.220]   So you don't need like a subscription to Tivo and anyone can build a PVR without having
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.140]   to worry about getting the EPG data.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.860]   And there's 30 free digital terrestrial channels.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:35.340]   Where do you come down on the BBC iPlayer issue, Corey?
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.780]   I don't like it very much.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:41.460]   I've said a lot about this in public and in private to the beeb and I think it's well
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:47.020]   I heard last week from an incredibly reliable source that they've got around or fewer than
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.500]   10,000 people using it.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.820]   So having spent millions of pounds on it, they failed completely to actually do anything
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:53.820]   with it.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.500]   It doesn't run on the back at all, right?
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.500]   It doesn't run on the back.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.700]   It's a streamer on Macs and it'll run as a streamer on Linux.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.900]   But what it does is that's only because they were forced to do that.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.300]   They weren't going to do that much.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.340]   And so what I mean, it's a really complex story because what happened is the trust to
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.980]   govern the BBC and govern it very poorly these days told them that they weren't allowed
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:18.660]   to play hardball with the rights holders and say you have to give us programs on terms
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.980]   that allow us to allow people to download them and keep them the way that they can record
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.900]   them with a VCR or get them with a PC capture card and keep them.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.900]   And so the rights holders got together and they said, yeah, you can only keep your digital
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.100]   TV shows for seven days.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.580]   And that means that like you can't bank a whole bunch of your kids favorite cartoons
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:43.020]   for them to watch on New Year's morning when you're sleeping in and hung over and you hope
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.180]   that they'll entertain themselves.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:51.180]   The way that you could with a regular PVR or with a VCR and the real tragedy of this is
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.880]   that millions of Britons, unlike the 10,000 people who use the iPlayer, millions of Britons
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.060]   are getting their TV from like UK Nova and the Pirate Bay and all these download sites
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:06.500]   and risking like legal sanction and all kinds of terrible, you know, they could be bankrupted
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.220]   or jailed or whatever in order to watch television and to watch television that they're required
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.180]   by law to fund the production of, right?
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:18.980]   So like the government will find you an enormous sum of money if you don't pay money to the
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.260]   BBC to commission these programs.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:25.380]   But when you try to watch these programs with your computer on your own terms, you will
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.940]   also get in trouble.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.460]   And so I think that the iPlayer doesn't work outside the UK though, right?
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.980]   And it doesn't work outside the UK.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.380]   No, is that ever going to change?
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.380]   Well, yeah.
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.940]   So this is the thing is there's a division of the BBC called BBC Worldwide that accounts
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:44.420]   for about 5% of what the BBC makes and its mission is basically to turn the BBC into
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.740]   blockbuster for Americans.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:50.580]   So it figures out how to market all that stuff to BBC America and you know, it's how you
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.820]   get your doctor who reruns in the States and how the stores are full of BBC DVDs.
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:58.620]   And that's a fine little mission for them to make a little money on the side.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:03.300]   But BBC Worldwide is now kind of driving the bus and they're saying like, well, you know,
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.180]   if we had an iPlayer that didn't have strong geo-fencing, it would undermine BBC America's
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:12.260]   ability to sell the iPlayer to Americans.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.620]   And so we need to have all these other restrictions so that it's easier to sell the iPlayer to
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.180]   Americans.
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:23.820]   And you know, what that means is that the future of British television is being driven
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.140]   by what Americans need.
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.620]   And that's really silly because Americans aren't licensed players.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.700]   You know, the other thing about the iPlayer is that the DRM that they've put on it at
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.280]   the request of the rights holders, they keep saying, well, we need to do this to stop the
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.420]   show from showing up on peer to peer.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:43.500]   But the fact is that the BBC spends millions of pounds blanketing the entire country with
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.580]   clear text digital copies of every show they air on the air, right?
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:53.620]   If they have digital free, you know, open broadcasts of it at the speed of light, they
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.780]   have a satellite that transmits it in the clear, right?
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.260]   So like this is like saying, well, you know, if we don't add another inch of steel to the
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.140]   front door of this safe that the rest of which is made out of toilet paper, people will
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.740]   break into the safe, but the rest of the safe is still made out of lu-roll, right?
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.740]   I mean, it's the same argument.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.740]   It doesn't matter how thick the door is.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.700]   It's the same argument about music copy protection.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.700]   You're giving away CDs with no protection or selling CDs with no protection.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.700]   Let's let's, I want to wake John up.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.300]   So I'm going to see if I can find a story that is going to intrigue him.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.460]   John, are you still there?
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.460]   Macintosh Macintosh.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.460]   John's passed out.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:33.780]   I just want to see how long you guys would go with what kind of who gives a crap stories.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.980]   Do you care that Google has officially said on Friday that it will be buying into the auction?
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.260]   Here's my question.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.400]   Is Google really going to make a serious bid for the 700 megahertz spectrum, or are they
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.620]   just going to make the token $4.6 million bid then walk away?
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.100]   How serious are they about actually acquiring this spectrum?
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.180]   You know, it seems to me that I don't think I care about that either.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:59.860]   You probably write, you know, I have a friend who's a very distinguished old science fiction
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.700]   writer and someone said he's so were bane.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.900]   He never did anything for the first time.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.140]   John never did anything for the first time.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.100]   Do you care about Michelle Malkin's blog outing?
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:16.580]   Many of the YouTube videos in the CNN debates, many of these, many of these questioners is
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:23.060]   actually an interesting story or plants for, you know, supporters of other public supporters
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.060]   of other candidates and so forth.
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:29.340]   Well, you know, everybody was had to be expecting that, but you think CNN would do a little
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.660]   better job of it.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.260]   I mean, see, that's a fiasco.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:38.380]   Well, but is the problem that the debate had people show up to watch it who disagreed
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.660]   with the people who were saying stuff on the stage?
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.980]   Isn't that like part and parcel of a debate?
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:43.980]   True.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.980]   True.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.740]   I mean, there's no debate that I'm sorry.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.740]   But there's no debate here.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.140]   I mean, they weren't debating anyway.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.420]   They were just a bunch of crazy questions.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:00.220]   Many of them asked by snowmen and avatars and crusty the clown lookalikes.
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.220]   That's mainstream media.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.220]   That's what mainstream media thinks the internet is.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.580]   I just don't understand what you're doing right to that.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.060]   And then there is no debate and it's over controlled.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.740]   I don't even know why these guys put up with it.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:14.060]   They should have walked from that thing and said, let's go across the street here and just
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.220]   sit amongst ourselves.
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:20.700]   Let somebody camcored it and we'll just argue with each other and they would be a lot better
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.700]   a show.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:27.940]   Well, yeah, but the whole question of like, oh my gosh, YouTube had people on it asking
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.300]   questions to Republicans who disagreed with Republicans.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.100]   I don't know why that's a scandal.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.500]   No, that's not the scandal.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.380]   The scandal is their insincere.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.380]   It's a sincerity issue.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.340]   It's got nothing to do with the fact that the questions.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.300]   But if you have some phony baloney, this is like George Bush and the fact that they
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.780]   screen people that go in there so they can cheer for them when they want.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:53.460]   Whether they have no protest zones now that are fenced off, this is all a level of insincerity
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.460]   that's unconscionable.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.740]   I just don't see how anybody could...
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.140]   These guys pretended to be Republican snowmen.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.140]   Is that the problem?
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.140]   Yes, and crusties and so on.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.020]   What they're trying to avoid is what happens in Britain.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:12.300]   I was there for the last election with Tony Blair and they actually allow real people
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:17.260]   to ask him real questions before I've television or any instance.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.020]   And they're really tough questions.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:29.260]   I remember they'd say to him, at one point, one person says to him, "Mr. Vice President."
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:35.180]   He looks puzzled and it's like an insult because they consider him George Bush's poodle and
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.740]   calling him Mr. Vice President is like an incredible insult.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.740]   They were able to get away with that.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:47.940]   In addition to that, the questioners who are often from the BBC ask really tough questions.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.580]   You just don't see that here.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.020]   You know who this is to do a great job with this is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.860]   They had a show called This Hour is 22 Minutes that was all...
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.860]   It's still on.
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:58.860]   It's a great show.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:40:59.860]   But, yeah.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.860]   There's this woman, Mark Delahonti.
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.380]   I don't know if she still does the shtick.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.740]   She used to come to Parliament.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.860]   She's a very astute political thinker.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.860]   She would come to Parliament dressed like Zina Warrior Princess and a leather barbarian.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:14.740]   And this kind of thick-waisted but attractive middle-aged woman from Nova Scotia in a leather
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.780]   bikini with a broadsword.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.260]   And she would walk straight up to the MPs as they were walking at a session and ask them
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:26.060]   the most biting and incisive political questions as they stood there, galloping at her.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.340]   And she was so disarming that she got them to say stuff that they would have never said
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.860]   on camera with a regular CBC crew.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.060]   And at one point, the heads of the three major parties in Canada were all women.
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.380]   And she convinced them all to come to her place for a pajama party.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.380]   And then asked them like incredibly hard political questions while they did each other's hair.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.380]   It was so good.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.100]   We're going to go in that direction.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.500]   Why don't we just get with this next CNN debate?
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:53.980]   Just get stuttering John to come back and have him run the whole damn thing.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.980]   Not a bad idea.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.380]   I don't think he's had a lot of work lately.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.380]   Is he?
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.860]   No, he actually gets a lot of work because he doesn't stutter anymore.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.460]   He's the guy who does Jay Leno's show.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.460]   He's the announcer.
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.460]   You're kidding.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.460]   No, you didn't know that.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.060]   He got a job as an announcer.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.060]   How to perp.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.260]   Yeah, he doesn't stutter anymore.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.780]   And now he's a formal announcer.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.860]   He does voice over.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.260]   He's Jay Leno's announcer.
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.500]   That's the biggest turnaround in show this history.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   John Melendez.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   I had no idea.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.780]   I haven't been so shocked since I discovered that Tony the tiger and the haunted mansion
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.020]   guy were the same person.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.020]   Same guy.
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.780]   There are no windows, but there are corn flakes.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.780]   They're great.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.780]   They're great.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:33.060]   They're no windows and no doors and they're great.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:37.220]   It is time to take a little break and so you may go back to your respective corners
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.980]   and mention audible.com or sponsor the show today.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.860]   You don't have to talk about it, Corey, because I know you're not a DRM fan.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.940]   You know, I bought several thousand dollars worth of Audible books and then when I changed
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:54.780]   platforms, it took me an entire month running three computers in parallel to get all the
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.740]   DRM off of my audiobook so I could listen to them.
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.140]   But you can't blame Audible because I mean, it's just like iTunes.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.220]   I think this is what the publishers require.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.020]   Oh, everyone points a finger at someone else.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.020]   Well, don't the publishers--
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.060]   Oh, actually, I will tell you why I blame Audible because my agent and I went to them
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.980]   with my next book because my publisher wanted to do an audio edition.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.100]   They wanted to sell it through Audible and they said, "We will do it, but only without
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.100]   DRM."
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.940]   Audible said, "I'm sorry, we will only sell books with DRM."
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:25.380]   Even though they have a DRM-free distribute product, which is their podcasts and stuff,
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:30.260]   and even though they are the exclusive supplier of audiobooks to iTunes, so no one else is
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.580]   allowed to sell audiobooks on iTunes.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:36.820]   And even though Steve Jobs says, "Oh, we want a DRM-free product in iTunes," Audible will
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:41.060]   not sell material without DRM even if the author demands it.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.820]   So we're not doing it with Audible.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.820]   We're not doing it for iTunes.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:44.820]   That's really too bad.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.820]   Leo, do you have a-- you just lost your sponsor.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.820]   Well, no.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.020]   Plug away, plug away.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.820]   Who needs sponsors?
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:56.020]   You know, I mean, I never make much money on this anyway.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:00.460]   If you don't mind a little DRM, and frankly, you know, I don't think your only choice,
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.140]   the other choice is cassettes, you might want to check out Audible.com.
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.500]   Or ripping CDs.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.500]   You could rip CDs.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.220]   The problem with that is when you get one big file and--
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:10.660]   Or a thousand little ones.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.660]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.220]   And it's not an easy-- it's kind of hard to play them, to be honest with you.
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.220]   I don't know.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.220]   I live with a DRM.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.220]   That's all.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.700]   Or you could-- I know this is shocking, but you could read a book, too.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.300]   No, I'm going to get a Kindle so I don't have to ever touch paper again.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.300]   You can't get DRM.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.300]   No, you can't get paper cuts.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.540]   I'm a huge audiobook dude.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.540]   I mean, it's my whole life.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:35.060]   Did you know Kindle, by the way, is selling on eBay for-- because Amazon said it's not
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:40.140]   going to be available shipping license until after Christmas, it's going for like $600
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.940]   to $1,000 now?
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.940]   Literally.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.940]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.940]   It is.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.140]   What did we do before eBay was a round of pump up these markets?
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.460]   I mean, I imagine a Nintendo Wii is probably going for more than that.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.860]   It's going for more than the Wii, like much more.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:55.860]   Double.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.260]   The Kindle's going for more than the Wii?
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.260]   Double, yeah.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.980]   So we got to find out who these idiots are who buy these things.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.820]   I'm getting my Kindle in two days.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.500]   I've going to turn around and sell it on eBay.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.500]   Right.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.500]   So I got to throw a plug out this as we're doing this.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.500]   Yes.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.700]   I want to thank Tom Mullins of the Charleston department store for sending me a West Virginia
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:14.700]   hoodie.
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.700]   Yes.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.540]   I put everybody else off say, went to laughter the championship game so they go out and
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.820]   lose to this lousy team pit.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.820]   And so they're not going to go to the championship now.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.900]   So those those hoodies I was hoping for, nothing happened.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.620]   Is this like a table tennis team or something that you're following?
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.180]   Yeah, it's a big table tennis team.
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.180]   They're really good too.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:36.740]   Loves this thing away back and then they slash at the ball and it goes straight and
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:37.740]   then it drops like a rock.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.540]   It's the damnest thing you've ever seen.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.540]   Wow.
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:41.540]   Wow.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.820]   I'd like to mention Audible Duck right now.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.700]   They sponsored the show for the last time and we want to thank them so much for being
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.260]   here for as long as they did.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.660]   It was only a matter of time.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.660]   Audible.com/twit.
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:56.660]   If you'd like to get a coupon, a credit toward a free book, I will recommend.
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.620]   Neil Gaiman book because I love Neil Gaiman.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.620]   I know you do.
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:01.620]   I'm sure you must.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.620]   Oh, hell yeah.
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:08.060]   Yeah, he's the greatest and a number of his books are on here, including Nancy Boys and
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.100]   American Gods, which I just loved.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.100]   Oh, God.
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.980]   Lenny Henry's reading of a Nancy Boys is like nothing short of brilliant and you can buy
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.580]   the MP3 CD on Amazon.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:17.580]   See, there you go.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.060]   So there you go.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.060]   All right.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.180]   I knew we could find something that Corey would like.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.180]   Oh, it's okay.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:28.460]   You're being a Nancy Boys, one of many, many 45,000 plus of books on Audible.com and they
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:32.060]   do do things like put the debates on unprotected and things like that.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.820]   They've been pretty good about their pro bono stuff.
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:34.820]   A U D.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.620]   I thought if authors ask for DRM free.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.620]   Well, you know what?
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.620]   I'm going to go right.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.180]   I'm going to go there and I'm going to talk to them.
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.180]   You're going to make a fuss, Leo.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.420]   I'm going to make it fuss.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.740]   We want Corey Doctorow on Audible.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.460]   I think they can have it man.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.980]   Just as long as it's DRM free.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:48.980]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.660]   It's not like it stops people from copying stuff.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.700]   I have a whole computer full of D DRM to Audible books to prove it.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.700]   But you know, it does.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.460]   What did you have to do?
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.620]   What did you have to do to take one book and rip it?
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.860]   Play it out in real time through audio hi-hat.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.860]   Analog hole, baby.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   Can never stop the analog hole.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.860]   That's just like my name.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:09.860]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.860]   Let's start.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.860]   There's a book, right?
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:12.860]   Hold on a second.
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:13.860]   Stop a second.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.820]   So you're telling me that the DRM is so easily defeatable because it's got an analog signal,
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.860]   obviously, or you couldn't hear it in the first place.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.900]   So what's the point of the DRM in the first place?
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.260]   The point is that it stops people from competing with Audible.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.340]   So only Audible can authorize playback devices.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:33.020]   And so Audible gets this like sort of super copy, right?
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:36.060]   Where normal copyright lets you control who can copy your works.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.980]   DRM copyright lets you control who can make a device that can play your work.
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.980]   And that's never been the principle.
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:45.060]   You know, making a record never gave you a veto over the design of the record player.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.900]   Audible gets that by adding DRM because of the DMCA.
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.620]   It's against the law to break the DRM.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.420]   Canada's getting a DMCA.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.260]   Switzerland's getting a DMCA.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.820]   Britain has so far rejected it, but they're going to get one.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:57.820]   I mean, it's neat to--
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.820]   What are we going to do about this?
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:47:59.820]   This is ridiculous.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.340]   We need to kick ass.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.460]   I mean, it's going to be a big issue in the next Canadian election.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:10.100]   There's a huge gear up happening for the new Canadian DMCA that's coming down in January.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:13.860]   The last two members of parliament who tried to bring the DMCA down in Canada lost their
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.020]   jobs.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.340]   We can do it again.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.340]   Switzerland, they need 50,000 signatures to reverse the law.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.420]   We just put up the petition.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.140]   I blogged it five minutes before we started talking.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.500]   You can put it in the show notes, Leo.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.900]   It's on point-boing right now.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.100]   50,000 is not a big number.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.980]   You know, there's that many geeks in Switzerland who care about it.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.580]   And they'll just knock the law out.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:37.460]   It's very difficult because I think most people just aren't galvanized about that they don't
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:38.460]   care that much about it.
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.460]   They're getting there, though.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.300]   Sony Rootkit was the best gift people I've ever had.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:49.260]   And I think the fact that EMA, AMI, and others are starting to offer unprotected music
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.700]   gives people at least a notion of what it might be like.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.860]   And the work of DVD, John.
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.900]   Thank God for DVD, John.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:58.900]   Good old, John.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:48:59.900]   What is this?
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:00.900]   This is a great thing.
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.900]   I don't know.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:02.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:03.900]   I haven't ever heard from the woman.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:07.260]   You know, I wrote a long, long profile about him a couple of years ago.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.900]   And the last I heard from him, he was going to get married.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.900]   Yeah, there goes that.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.900]   I think he did.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.580]   As I remember, he did some iPhone D stuff.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:18.580]   Yes.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.580]   He's in San Francisco now.
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.580]   I do know that.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:25.900]   And when he first came over, he was working for some guy who founded the mp3.com.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.540]   I think he did.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.420]   DVD, John's out here in San Francisco.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.420]   Yes, he is.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.420]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.420]   I got to get him on cranky geeks.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.420]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.140]   Oh, he's the nicest guy.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.140]   You can probably find him.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.540]   He's the nicest guy, but then maybe it won't work out.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.740]   Me, you, Corey.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.540]   Somebody more.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.540]   John Lech Johansen.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.540]   John.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:45.540]   John.
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.500]   He started something called double twist ventures, I think.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.940]   And he was trying to sell some Apple defeating technology.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.740]   Yeah, that was a really funny one.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:58.060]   It was they would take, they would put your DRM on an Apple song.
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.420]   So they would undo our Apple and then put your DRM on it so that you could then put
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:02.420]   it on your device.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.980]   It was just, it was, that's why it was called double twist.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:05.980]   It was, it was very funny.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:10.220]   It was while my class was in session last year at USC and we, we, we had a great day
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.420]   talking about it.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:15.500]   He's, he's a funny, he's, he's a master practitioner of, you know, you know, I'm, I'm
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.500]   DRM judo.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.220]   You certainly, how old is he now?
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:19.660]   Is he like in his early twenties?
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.660]   He can't be very old.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.460]   He's probably about 26 or so.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.460]   Okay.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.460]   Uh, his date of birth is 1983, according to Wikipedia.
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:31.380]   So that would make him 24 24 24 24.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.380]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:33.380]   Oh my gosh.
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:34.380]   Only about three or four years left.
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.820]   It's kind of a, yeah, then it's over.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.140]   Then he's going to be a pundit on Twitch.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:44.060]   Uh, mobile phone subscriptions hit 3.3 billion worldwide.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.900]   That's a lot of people with cell phones.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.620]   59 countries have mobile penetration.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.780]   I don't understand this over 100%.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.060]   More than one mobile phone per person Finland.
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:57.500]   I have two phones, but I thought that was kind of odd.
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.300]   You're up at the common.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.300]   Really?
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:04.940]   I once read the penetration Finland of like seven to 10 year olds was something like over
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:05.940]   70%.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:06.940]   Wow.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:07.940]   Well, okay.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:11.980]   You own more than one because it's because you have a work phone and a home and a personal
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:12.980]   phone.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:17.340]   There's also a lot of people that have a voice phone and then a messaging phone.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.340]   Right.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.340]   Or I have Blackberry.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.340]   I have a Blackberry for the email and then it also does.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.260]   Corey, how's the iPhone doing in Britain?
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.500]   There've been kind of mixed reports in the States.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.260]   I, you know, I see them in like car phone warehouse and I see the posters, but I haven't
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.980]   seen anyone carrying one.
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.500]   Um, you know, the data plans here are so bonkers.
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:39.140]   Uh, they, you know, they, they, they do such violence to the term unlimited here.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.500]   Uh, when it comes to unlimited data plans, they make Verizon look, you know, like honest
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.500]   upstanding sit.
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.420]   So, uh, I just got a T-Mobile 3G fob.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:51.660]   Um, and I noticed when I read the fine print that it says it's unlimited, but like something
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.860]   like the good neighbor policy applies.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:55.860]   It makes no sense at all.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:56.860]   And it's a variety.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.740]   That's the language Verizon's got to use.
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:51:59.740]   I like that.
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:00.740]   Oh, it's so bizarre.
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.700]   And so you get n bits per month.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:06.420]   But the thing is that that doesn't really speak to, well, there's a couple of problems.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:11.140]   One is that no human being ever was able to guesstimate how many bits they were consuming.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.140]   Right.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.500]   So many bits you might consume when you click a link.
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.300]   So it's a terrible thing to bill you on because you have no control over it.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.700]   No way of measuring it.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.780]   No way of knowing how you're performing with it.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.340]   And then, and then the other problem is that you can imagine that you could totally blow
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:29.660]   through your limit if you had like a low trickle of data, like 10 k per second around the clock,
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.140]   sitting there in your, in your home with no one else in the same cell as you and you
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:37.220]   wouldn't ever do anything bad to their capacity.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:42.180]   On the other hand, you could not exceed your limit, but do a lot of heavy streaming in
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:45.900]   a place where there's a lot of other people hanging around and really, really cause a
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.180]   lot of contention.
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:52.820]   So capping the number of bits per month doesn't really have anything to do with balancing
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.220]   out their load so that everyone gets a fair share because if there's a million people
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:00.700]   around you all downloading their limit in the space of an hour, no one's going to get
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.700]   anything.
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.260]   And if there's one person around you and you're both very nice about your bandwidth, but use
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:08.420]   it around the clock, then you're both going to end up going over your limit.
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.580]   And so it's not a great way to build this stuff, I think.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.140]   And what are they doing about roaming charges?
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.620]   Because that was a big issue here.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:19.980]   If you bought what an iPhone brought it to Europe, you know, thousands of dollars.
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:20.980]   I don't know.
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:23.260]   I know this, the 3G stuff doesn't roam.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.260]   My 3G modem will roam.
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:28.420]   I was in Germany and Austria last week, the week before, and I couldn't turn it on.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:34.180]   But I think the GPRS rooms, I don't know what the iPhone data roaming plans are like.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.860]   You can get a pretty good roaming package for voice here.
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:42.780]   I tend to pay about 20 cents a minute for roaming when I'm overseas and when I'm making
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.140]   overseas calls, which is a lot better than like T-Mobile.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:53.140]   T-Mobile was like, I called my fiance when she was in Germany on her T-Mobile phone.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:57.820]   And just for her to get a call, this was T-Mobile USA, to get the call, picking up the phone was
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:58.980]   a buck.
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.100]   And then it went up from there.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:03.780]   And so it was like Mexico, right?
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:07.220]   You know, she could practically see America from where she was.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.220]   Right.
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:11.820]   What do you think I know this probably doesn't concern you much, Corey, but Verizon, for
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:15.060]   reasons unknown, is announced it's going to open up.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.060]   It's a network.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:20.100]   Verizon Wireless announced it will prove, this is a quote, "provide customers the option
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:25.020]   to use on its nationwide wireless network, wireless devices, software and applications
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.980]   not offered by the company.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:31.660]   Wireless plans, Verizon Wireless plans to have this new choice available to customers throughout
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.580]   the country by the end of 2008."
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:40.660]   Yeah, they're embracing what's called in telco circles, the Carter phone doctrine, which
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:45.220]   comes from the big lawsuit AT&T had over whether or not you should be allowed to plug
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.300]   stuff into their network.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.220]   And when AT&T lost that, it actually ended up making them more money because all of a
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.660]   sudden, people who weren't AT&T could think of things to use AT&T's networks for, and
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.380]   that drove demand for AT&T's network.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.740]   You still have to rent it from Western Electric to get a phone and have to pay a couple of
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.740]   bucks a month.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.460]   Well, anything else on there?
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:06.020]   The first of these lawsuits was over something called Hush-a-Phone, which was like a giant
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:09.700]   cup that went around the receiver of your phone so that people couldn't hear what you
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:10.700]   were saying.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.660]   AT&T argued that it might damage their network to have these big plastic cups fitted over
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:15.660]   the ends of receivers.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:21.700]   But this all comes from the work of an amazing scholar, a guy named Tim Wu, who is now in
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.700]   DC, I think, but he was at Columbia.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:27.380]   He got tenure at Columbia and then abruptly left and went to DC to work on the Hill.
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:35.180]   And Tim is a great scholar on telecoms, lawyer, and he's great on copyright.
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.500]   He's a LESIC protege.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:40.140]   And the weird thing is that we went to elementary school together in Toronto.
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.980]   And I lost touch with him for like 20 years.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:46.500]   And I met him when a girl I was dating went to DC to see the Eldred case, the Supreme
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.580]   Court case on copyright extension, and ran into Tim on the steps.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.380]   And she's like, "I'm from Toronto."
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.100]   And she said, "Oh yeah, I'm dating a guy from Toronto."
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.420]   And then what's his name?
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.300]   I've known him since I was eight.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.300]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.300]   Tim and I are pals again.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.300]   It's awesome.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:03.540]   So this means, I think, in theory that Nokia could make a CDMA phone that would work on
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:06.420]   the wireless network, sell it to you direct.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.620]   And Verizon would allow you to use it.
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:09.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:13.220]   I think part of that's going to be driven by the iPhone and how much bad press I'm like
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.220]   that right?
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:20.500]   And by Google poses with Android, its own operating system, and the 700 megahertz auctions.
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.500]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:27.700]   Well, but I also think that just all this, the fact that Apple and AT&T caught tons of bad
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:33.140]   press over lock-in probably made Verizon think, "Well, if we didn't have lock-in, maybe we'd
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:36.620]   get the inverse of that and craplodes of good press."
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:40.020]   No language in the world contains the phrase as palatable as a phone company.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:46.700]   You don't think Google's recent announcement about getting their software onto mobile
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:49.300]   phones has something to do with what Verizon's doing?
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.300]   Sure.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:51.300]   Sure.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.860]   I mean, this is the trend.
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:56.060]   I guess the real question is how much is Verizon going to charge?
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.940]   What plans they're going to offer for this?
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:03.860]   If I try to buy a, use a Wi-Fi phone on their network, how are they going to feel about
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:07.460]   that, a Skype phone on their network, how are they going to feel about that?
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:11.540]   I think they actually specifically mentioned that use case and said, "We plan on doing
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:12.540]   that.
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.060]   We plan on letting you do that."
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.060]   Wow.
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.980]   I seem to recall seeing that in their press materials on it.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.940]   Apple could do an iPhone for Verizon.
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:25.340]   Yeah, but then you saw what happened, I think it was T-Mobile in Germany.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.340]   They were--
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.100]   99 Euro unlocked iPhones.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.100]   Right.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:34.340]   What a deal, such a deal.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:39.500]   But then, aren't the French unlocked iPhones now competing with the German unlocked iPhones?
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.700]   Because it's the common market.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.500]   I don't think they can stop you from importing them.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.500]   Right.
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.140]   Well, so do we believe Verizon?
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:53.140]   I mean, is this a new and kinder gentler of Verizon wireless or is this--
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.940]   Oh, Malek seems to think, "Pfft, yeah, right."
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:58:00.940]   Well, remember, this is the company that spent millions of dollars fighting recording industry
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.540]   subpoenas and won the principal that they have to actually--
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:06.740]   Or recording industry non-sapenas where they went--
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.580]   The record industry would go to them and say--
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:10.060]   The John Doe subpoenas.
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.220]   Yeah, well, they would go like, "We're the--"
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:14.100]   No, this before the John Doe's.
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:17.100]   They would just show up and they'd say, "Here's some IP addresses.
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.980]   Tell us who these people are and where they live."
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:24.460]   And Verizon said, "Go prove to a court that these people have done something wrong.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.020]   Get the court to order us to turn it over and we'll do it."
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:31.220]   But you guys don't get to just come in and go through our filing cabinets.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:32.220]   And they won--
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:35.180]   It was millions of dollars they spent.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.180]   And they won.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:39.340]   So, Verizon isn't unmitigated evil.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.340]   They're mitigated evil.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:43.180]   Well, and on the other hand, they are the ones who shut down--
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.380]   Or tried to shut down Pennsylvania's open Wi-Fi.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:46.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.380]   They're mitigated evil.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.380]   Mitigated.
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:49.380]   They're not unmitigated.
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.380]   They're mitigated.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.380]   I know.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:54.820]   The Kindle sucks, but Amazon isn't the worst company in the world.
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:56.460]   They do lots of great stuff.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:59:00.420]   They just fought the federal government to keep tens of thousands of their customer records
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.340]   out of the NSA's hands.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.180]   So, yeah, they launched the Kindle.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.180]   It's terrible.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.180]   I think it's a really dumb thing.
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:12.180]   I think Amazon is the world's greatest hard goods vendor and the world's dumbest digital goods
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.340]   vendor between this.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:18.780]   And they're stupid Amazon unbox and the bad terms of service on their MP3 store.
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:22.180]   It's like, why is it that the best company on the web is the worst company on the web
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:24.020]   when they're selling digital stuff?
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:28.540]   But they're pretty damn good when it comes to protecting user privacy from phishing expeditions.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.180]   So, got to give them that.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.140]   Is your objection to the Kindle, the DRM?
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.540]   Yeah, in the terms of use.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.540]   What are the terms of use?
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.540]   The terms of use.
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.740]   So, you can't loan it, sell it, or give it away, right?
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:42.500]   And this is the company when the authors guild threatened to sue them for helping people
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.820]   to sell used books.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:48.020]   Jeff Bezos, who I think of as a friend and who I think is an amazing guy, made this public
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:52.500]   statement where he said buying a book gives you the right to sell it and give it away.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.500]   Everybody knows this.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:55.500]   Not an ebook, I guess.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.500]   But not an ebook.
[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.180]   And it's like, well, what is it about the, you know, is it, is it, why is it that you can
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:05.020]   sell me a book and no one thinks that putting a shrink wrap license on the cover of that
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:08.700]   book that says, you know, you can only read this if you're a Republican and you can't give
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.820]   it to your friends to read and you have to read it on one leg and we're allowed to come
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.420]   over to your house and take the book away if we think you're misusing it.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.420]   People go, that's crazy.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:16.420]   It's my book.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.580]   But as soon as that book is represented as zeros and ones, it's like, you can have terms
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.820]   of service like the Kindle has where if they think you're violating their terms, they can
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.820]   take your books away.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:28.620]   Well, isn't it because it's possible to make infinite perfect digital copies?
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.620]   Isn't that the issue?
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:33.100]   Yeah, but why not make that the thing that's that you're not allowed to do?
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.100]   Right.
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.100]   Right.
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:38.140]   It's not that that doesn't have any nexus with like, loaning a book to a friend or giving
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.140]   it away or selling it.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.020]   So you're saying if I buy a Kindle, I use it for a minute, I can't give it to you or
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.660]   sell it to you?
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.500]   You're not without violating the terms of service, not the books anyways.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.300]   I don't know what the terms of service and the Kindle are, but the books terms of service
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.660]   say that you're not allowed to lend them, sell them or give them away.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.660]   Right.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.140]   So like, you know, you're careful selling your Kindle because you know, it's linked to your
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.140]   Amazon account.
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.500]   Yeah, it's tied to your account.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.780]   You'd have to do you.
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:06.180]   Your kids, your kids school libraries filled with books that people gave donated to the
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.180]   library.
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.180]   Right.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.700]   So that's the future look like if digital books can't be given away or alone.
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:17.380]   And what does it say about like the way that we conduct culture if loaning becomes illegal
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.780]   and giving stuff away donating?
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.180]   But there is a fundamental difference.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.060]   There's a one physical copy of that book.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:26.700]   If I loan it, I'm by definition depriving myself of it.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:30.500]   Yeah, but no one shut down use CD stores just because people can rip CDs.
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.580]   Well, I think they'd like to.
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.300]   I think they would, but they have managed to.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.180]   But that's, you see, now you're getting now, you're verging.
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.540]   But when it's a completely digital copy, I can keep a copy, give you a copy, loan another
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.540]   guy a copy.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.820]   And we've made three copies now and paid for one.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:49.300]   But you know, you can do that with a CD today.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:54.620]   And no one would seriously say that the law should step in and ban the practice of loaning
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:55.820]   or giving away CDs.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.660]   In fact, you know, like anyone who tried to get libraries to stop stocking CDs would
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:03.420]   be in deep trouble with everyone who cares about access to information.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:07.220]   And yeah, you know, everyone who listens to CDs these days as a computer and could rip
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.660]   it and make a copy.
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:12.420]   But you know, one of the principles of law and a democracy is you don't punish the innocent
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.940]   to get at the guilty.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.100]   Right.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:20.140]   We have the presumption of innocence and you don't confiscate the the and let's actually
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.860]   let's take it back one step.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.380]   Will a user agreement stop dishonest people?
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.380]   No, of course not.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.300]   Nor does the RM stop dishonest people.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.700]   So this only works on honest people, right?
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:34.420]   This only works on people who aren't doing unreasonable terrible things.
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.660]   So I just think that, you know, here's a company that stands up for consumer rights almost
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:41.700]   always except when they're selling digital goods and then they throw stuff in the user
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.460]   agreement like we can delete arbitrary files off your hard drive.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.420]   You know, and it's just it's crazy.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:51.220]   Although I could also point out that most honest people don't even read user agreements
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.940]   and probably aren't aware of what they're agreeing to in the first place.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.940]   Yeah, sure.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:59.060]   But you know, like Amazon, if you buy an actual DVD from Amazon and then you call them up
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:03.020]   and you say the DVD never arrived, they'll put another one on the mail to you without
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.860]   needing any proof at all.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:08.740]   But if you download the TV for Amazon and you call them up and you say the file didn't
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.180]   work, they say, ah, tough.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.180]   Interesting.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.180]   A couple of stories we can wrap up here.
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.180]   Very interesting conversation.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:19.500]   Obviously about to talk about I don't know if I want to talk too much about the Jeff
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:24.300]   Gerstman game spot issue because I don't think we've heard the whole story, but it's
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.700]   I should mention that we're I'm aware of the story and we'll probably follow it next week.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:34.060]   The game spot fired a 10 year editor, Jeff Gerstman, apparently for being a negative
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.260]   and a review of an E-DOS game.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.460]   But we haven't heard from game spot.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.460]   There may have been who knows.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.100]   Maybe he was drunk when he wrote it.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.100]   I don't know.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.620]   But I just want to mention we do know of the story and if you want to hear more coverage
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.900]   of it, when we hear more more information, we'll let you know.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.900]   Also big story.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:55.660]   Last night, Jimmy Wales at a Wikipedia party announced that Wikipedia is going to be
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.460]   CC.
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.660]   He'll be Creative Commons.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.660]   BYSA.
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:04.180]   So what's that?
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.660]   Attribution non-commercial.
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.540]   I share a like.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:14.260]   It means you have to attribute it and you have to allow anyone else to use anything you
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.780]   make with it on the same terms.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:16.780]   Big deal.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:17.780]   So it's that he's a that he's a.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.780]   It's like a PPO.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:23.860]   It's funny because I teach a graduate level course in reporting and I ban my students
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.100]   from footnoting or using Wikipedia.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.100]   Oh really?
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.100]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:29.100]   It's funny.
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:33.780]   I taught a graduate course but one of my assignments to my students was you have to improve Wikipedia
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.780]   entries.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.780]   Oh that's good.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.780]   That's good.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.780]   That's a little different.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.780]   Why did you ban it?
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.860]   Well because of accuracy issues.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:46.100]   I mean, you know, anyone can come on there pretty much and you know, change things.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.500]   And you know, so there's a credibility issue.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.660]   But you know, the best Wikipedia entries are those I think that are footnoted and show
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.940]   what the source is and all that.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:00.380]   But just like I tell them that never to use Google is a spell checker.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:01.380]   Really?
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.380]   Is it bad?
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:03.380]   Oh yeah.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:09.140]   I mean, if LaPort, I'm sure if I put in LaPort spelled L-A-P-O-R-T it would get lots
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.980]   of hits from people who spelled it wrong.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.580]   But it does say do you mean LaPort with an E?
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:15.580]   It does it.
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.580]   Wow.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.660]   You're really you're such a celebrity.
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:19.820]   I'm highly ranked.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:20.820]   How about stick low?
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:23.620]   What happens when you type stick low wrong?
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:29.340]   Anyway, I typed stuck low and it says, do you mean stuck low?
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.340]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.340]   There you go.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.540]   My alter ego.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:33.540]   I am.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:41.220]   No, I do think that, you know, kids today, you know, my son sports team.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.220]   Just starting in high school.
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:45.500]   I mean, you know, they I had to change Google because there is a way to do it so that the
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.060]   Wikipedia doesn't come up first when you're doing research.
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.060]   Oh interesting.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:53.420]   You can actually go into Google and tell it, for example, to have the encyclopedia of
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.700]   Britannica show up first.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   Really?
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:56.700]   I didn't know that.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:57.700]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.100]   Well, you know what I love about Wikipedia is and full disclosure, Jimmy and I are writing
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.100]   a book together.
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.100]   He's actually in London.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.980]   We're having meetings all this week about the book.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:10.460]   But one of the things I love about Wikipedia is that it fails so gracefully compared to,
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:15.020]   you know, the Britannica or a newspaper in that when there's a mistake, it's a lot easier
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:20.860]   to fix it in Wikipedia than it is in, you know, the New York Times.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:25.140]   And you know, Wikipedia is also if you if you become Wikipedia literate, it becomes
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.420]   a lot easier to figure out when Wikipedia issues are contentious, right?
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:32.660]   I've never seen an article in The Times that had a little banner at the top of it that said
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:37.900]   note, six out of 14 people in the newsroom thought that this article was complete garbage,
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.900]   right?
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:43.260]   There are the times publishes plenty of articles that meet those criteria, but you never find
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.260]   out about it.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.780]   And Wikipedia, if you know how to look, makes that transparent.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:47.780]   There's been a lot of time.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.780]   But if there was a second, how to do that?
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:54.780]   But if there is an error in a New York Times story that's, you know, that they acknowledge
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:00.140]   in a correction, it will appear in the database from then on at the top of the story as this
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.140]   story was corrected.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.900]   And here's what the mistake was.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:06.900]   But if Wikipedia has a mistake, it gets corrected.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:10.740]   Those people who used it beforehand when there was mistakes, they'll never know, right?
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.380]   Well, yeah, that's also true.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:15.060]   The New York Times, unless you happen to go look it up in the database.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:19.740]   But you know, the point is that the preferred form of accessing Wikipedia is in the database,
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.020]   but it's online.
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.220]   So it's not like there ever is an addition of Wikipedia that you don't look to.
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:27.020]   I mean, I agree that both of them fail.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:30.260]   I guess it's a question of which one fails better.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:33.780]   And I feel like Wikipedia fails pretty good.
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.780]   You know, we could imagine.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:35.780]   Pretty well.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:36.780]   Let's get this.
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.740]   No, no, no.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.740]   English does not have a formally correct grammar.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.740]   It's one of the, it's one of the, one of the things that makes it so successful is that
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.020]   it has no formal grammar.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.460]   It has only usage.
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.100]   Okay.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.700]   So is it okay to say pretty good now?
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:52.700]   It's colloquial.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.820]   There are lots of people who say it.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.580]   It is only a podcast after all.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.580]   I'm just saying.
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.980]   I just like correct my daughter on this one all the time and when I make that mistake,
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:00.980]   she corrects me.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:01.980]   You know what's wrong?
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.980]   Are we on the AP style book here?
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:03.980]   No, we are not.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:04.980]   No, we are not.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.980]   Is it ALA?
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.980]   We should come up with one.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.180]   If you want to depend on that usage, Corey, it's fine with me.
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:10.180]   I'm just saying.
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:14.860]   How about the use of my kids are always saying me and me and my buddy went somewhere and
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.540]   it's drives me crazy.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.540]   You know, Chaucer uses quadruple negatives.
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.540]   Wow.
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:22.700]   I don't even know what that would come out to.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:29.620]   That's like, you will not know, no, no, no, no, you will not neither.
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:30.620]   Other big stories.
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.060]   I don't know if we want to say anything about it.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:37.060]   Blizzard Activision emerges with Blizzard for $18.8 billion and then Vivendi, like the
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:40.060]   next minute comes along and takes a majority stake in Activision.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.700]   I don't know what that all means.
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.260]   Games are getting bigger, I guess.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.860]   It's our hero.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.860]   That's what it means.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:47.860]   Our hero?
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:48.860]   Yeah, guitar hero.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:49.860]   Oh, guitar hero.
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:50.860]   Of course.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.860]   Attack Division game.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:53.860]   Oh, interesting.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.860]   Definitely the hottest selling Christmas.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.860]   So how long before we were able to play Guitar Hero in World of Warcraft, I guess would be
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:58.860]   the...
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:04.140]   There's a Guitar Hero club that meets in the building across the streets from our bedroom
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.220]   and we see them at night.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.220]   Really rocking out.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.140]   It's one of those things where all the lights are out on the street and their light is glowing
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:14.140]   and you can just see these guys just like totally rocking out and getting plowed and
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.460]   rocking out to the Guitar Hero and then the summer when the windows are open, it's really
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:18.460]   like that.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.900]   You know, the Lost Greek Journal did a story a couple of years ago when the game first
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.860]   came out about real rock stars who really play it like after the show.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.860]   Really?
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:31.300]   And then often the guy who wrote the song, who's the guitar player who does it, loses
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.060]   out to the drama.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.060]   Wow.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:35.060]   That's really great.
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.060]   That's like a...
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:40.540]   But the idea that rock musicians relax by playing rock guitar heroes, great.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:44.980]   I love like Tiger Woods playing golf games on his way to the golf game.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.980]   Awesome.
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:46.980]   We golf.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.980]   Will you...
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:52.380]   Do you let your kids play Guitar Hero, Steve, and will you let your kid play Guitar Hero
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:56.140]   or whatever the derivative is of it in a few years at Corey?
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:59.900]   Well, you know, my fiance is an ex-professional Quake player and we have six consoles under
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:00.900]   the TV.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:01.900]   Oh, I guess I know what the answer is then.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:05.300]   Just to run video games for the BBC and now she's doing video game stuff for Channel
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.140]   4, so yeah, I think so.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.500]   But ruining Hanukkah and Christmas here, I'm not going to answer that question.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.100]   Alright, I guess we got our answer.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.460]   See, I don't want my kid to play a real guitar.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:19.860]   I figured the hours he'd put in a guitar hero he could actually learn an instrument.
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:21.300]   But I guess I'm in the minority here.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.500]   But what would he do with an instrument that he couldn't do with Guitar Hero, man?
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.940]   He could get his three initials up there at the top of the leaderboard for weeks.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:29.940]   Learn an instrument.
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:30.940]   I know.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940]   Learn an instrument.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.940]   Crazy talk.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.940]   So 20th century.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.440]   Alright, kids.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.440]   It's time to wrap this up.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.740]   I really want to thank you all.
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:42.060]   Corey Doctorow is online at craphound.com and of course on boingboing.net.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:43.420]   Anything else you want to...
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.980]   You've got books and are you a busy guy?
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.820]   I don't know what to put them on.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.180]   I guess I can plug...
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:50.820]   It's kind of early, but my next novel is coming out in May.
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:54.540]   A little brother about hacker kids who fight the Department of Homeland Security and win
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:57.540]   back the Bill of Rights for the hit book.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:02.420]   And every chapter has like make style how-tos for building real technology to like, you
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:06.140]   know, defeat CCTV cameras, get out of your school since proxy.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.140]   So it's like it.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.120]   Wikipedia Brown or, you know, Neuromancer.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   That's fantastic.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.760]   Where are you getting the designs?
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.840]   The Instructables is going to do a whole line of designs for it.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.040]   Oh, that's fantastic.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.640]   So it's going to be great.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.040]   This is your first year of an hour.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.240]   I mean, you've never done that before.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.240]   My first YA.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.760]   Yeah, well, it's not my first active...
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.240]   My first year of an Alak, but it is my first year of an Albonic.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.240]   It's true.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   I look forward to that.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.240]   That sounds...
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.240]   I'll get that for my son immediately.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.240]   I can't wait.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.040]   Steve Steclow writes for the feature...
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040]   I can never...
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.040]   A senior writer.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.740]   New title now, Deputy Bureau Chief Boston.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.040]   Hell, that's good.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.040]   That's good.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.040]   I like that.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.540]   Steve Steclow is the Deputy Bureau Chief Boston for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.940]   Not to be confused with the sheriff of the Bureau Chief in Boston.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.140]   He shot the show, but not the deputy.
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.140]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.140]   John C...
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.140]   Thank you, Steve, for being here.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.140]   I really appreciate it.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:58.140]   Great to talk to you.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.140]   Thanks.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.640]   And John C. Devorek, of course, Devorek.org/blog and also Cranky Geeks.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.040]   Look for Jan Lechval.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.640]   I want to say Lechvalenza.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.340]   Jan Lech, your Hanson on Cranky Geeks episodes soon.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:12.340]   John, are you still there?
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.340]   Barely.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:14.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:15.340]   But...
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:17.140]   John, it's never been so bored, I think.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.040]   No, I mean, I didn't just...
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.540]   Obviously, I didn't have as much coffee as these two guys.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.940]   Hey, it's almost midnight here.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:23.940]   It's after midnight here.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.440]   Well, I don't know what you're doing.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.440]   You need to drink more wine.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.040]   So anyway, yeah.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.140]   Yeah, that would be cool to get DVD, John, on Cranky Geeks and see what he has to say.
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.140]   That sounds like fun.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.140]   John, if you're listening...
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.440]   Jan, I should say.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.440]   Jan.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.140]   If you're listening, Cranky Geeks.org.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.140]   You can reach him through his blog, you know.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.140]   So sue me.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:48.140]   Devorek.org/blog.
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:49.140]   Oh, so sue me.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:50.140]   The blogs, sue me.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.140]   Is that how you pronounce that?
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.140]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.940]   Oh, see, I missed the joke.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.140]   I'm looking at it, trying to think of how to pronounce that.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.140]   Sausomie.
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.140]   Sausomie.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:04.040]   A Norwegian word meaning so sue me.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.040]   Another twit.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.040]   This is amazing.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   It is in the can.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.840]   And then I read for like half an hour.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.040]   I don't really go back and edit much, you know, if there's a really bad one.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.200]   But the only thing I really edit out is if I burp, because I think that's just the
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200]   grossest thing.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   Yeah, you don't want to hear that.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.200]   Yeah, it's just so...
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   You leave the flubs in.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.260]   but wait a minute. What if the guy in the book is burping?
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.960]   Well, the guy in the book is burping.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.500]   Let's see, why is it not juicy? It's...a drive. Yeah. That's only...
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.860]   But yeah, no, our!
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:38.360]   We're coughing.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.580]   You know what, a juicy bird?
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.600]   Hell of a time.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.180]   When blue screens, like, forget it.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.600]   I'm killing you!
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:56.600]   [MUSIC]
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:06.600]   [MUSIC]
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:16.600]   [MUSIC]
