[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twitch this week in Tech, Episode 45 for March 12th, 2006.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   [Music]
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Hello Leo. That is Doug K who is joining us via ISDN from his house in somewhere in Northern California.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Hello Doug. From Amsterdam, John C. Devorak who was trying to get home. Are you lost John?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   No, I'm leaving tomorrow.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   He was at Seabit in Hanover.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   So I had a funny thing happen to me today, I was kind of amusing.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Let me introduce the rest and we'll talk about that.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   What time is it though, real quickly, what time is it in Amsterdam?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   It's a little after 1 a.m.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Sorry we're keeping you up. All right, we'll move fast here.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   From via Skype, from San Francisco, it's Robert Herron and good afternoon to you Robert.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Hello.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And of course also from San Francisco via Skype and DLTV, it is Patrick Norton. Hello Patrick.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   How's it going?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   It's going great.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Hey Cranky Geeks, Episode 1, did that come out?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Yeah, actually it's up on, if you go up to www.dl.tv, scroll about a third of the way down, you will see the links to download the very first show.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Oh, that's the pilot, but there's another show coming out sooner.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Well, it depends on when John ever gets back from Germany.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I guess you can't really do it while you're in Germany.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So what happened to you that's so funny, John?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So I'm roaming around Amsterdam taking photos in my normal fashion when I hit these little towns.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And I got approached by a guy in a girl, a woman with a camera, and it's a guy doing what he calls, I guess it was, ambush journalism for a computer magazine.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Wow.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Do you know who you were?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He didn't follow.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   No, he didn't know who it was, but he'll find out when he goes to the website at www.org/blog.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Anyway, they asked people on the street about how long they've been using email and what the value of it is, which I thought was amusing.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   How long have they been using it?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Well, they don't use a lot of emails, pretty new some people.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Not in Amsterdam, but surely.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Apparently it is.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You didn't get recognized in Amsterdam, John.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You didn't get any recognized by any Twit fans in Amsterdam?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I didn't see bit a couple, but in Amsterdam, no.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   They used to have a column, I think, that ran in a licensed version of PC Magazine around here, but they don't have that anymore.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So I'm kind of just a normal person here.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It's probably just as well.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Nobody was throwing brickbats at you.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We missed you at the Apple Store, though.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   They were looking for you with brickbats there.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Well, you know, it's a shame, isn't it?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   This is going to be kind of the trade show report because John's got an update on C-bit.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   E-Tech just happened to, that's O'Reilly's emerging tech conference, and Doug Kay was down there, and he's going to give us the latest from E-Tech.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And joining us a little bit later, Will Harris, who is with a British enthusiast site called bit-tech.net, a great little site.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And he was at the Intel Developers Forum, so we'll get the latest on the IDF as well.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So a lot of news in the works.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   You know, I think, in fact, we could focus on that because there's not a whole lot of news in the rest of the world, except maybe this Google acquisition of Rightly, which is the online word processor.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Anybody surprised by that?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Yeah, actually.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I was a little surprised because I visited with the company and they were, they had this road map.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   They were actually going to do a calendaring program or some other things, I guess, which kind of fits in nicely with what Google's up to.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I just would, I knew that, you know, this is the kind of thing that looks like an M&A company, mergers and acquisitions design, you know, to be bought eventually, but I think this was a little earlier than they were anticipating.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It was quick.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   What did they pay for it?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I didn't see a number anywhere. Anybody see a number?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   No.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Rightly is, I think, a pretty slick product, although interestingly, it's not written in PHP or Java or anything you'd expect. It's written in .NET.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Well, I was under the impression it was written in C sharp.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah, exactly. C sharp and .NET.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   So, which, a scope.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Well, they were Microsoft.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   When I talked to them, I'm sorry, when I talked to them, they were going to record it in Java.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I wonder now because I don't think Google does much .NET stuff, so.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Nobody does much.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   .NET is a, I don't even want to get started.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's a beastie.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's a little beastie.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It was just, there's a lot of extremely well proven and hammered upon code and everything .NET in my life.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Right.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Right.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   That's a good point.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Was that the talk of ETEC Doug when you were there?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   You know, it was part of, I would say one of two themes.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It's sort of the Web 2.0 theme if you think about it in those terms.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And of course,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I think we'll get it.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   We'll get bought.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Well, ETEC was about 50% or maybe even more, you know, new company announcements and particularly companies that were involved in the, what Tim O'Reilly refers to as the Web 2.0 stuff.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   But, you know, it sort of resurfaces that old debate about Google is Google going to be a viable alternative to Microsoft and.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Well, it sure looks like they're putting an office suite together, doesn't it?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And, you know, we all thought, I think that if anything, Google was writing that in house.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Right.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And now they turn around and buy the, probably the core component, which is the word processor.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Michael Arrington, who broke this story, also broke the first pictures I've ever seen of Google Calendar.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And I have to say, looking at it, it looks like the typical sparse ugly Google project, unimpressive, you know, and nothing compared to say something like Yahoo Calendar.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Yeah, but you know, you might say that about Gmail, but it works.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   True.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   You know.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   True.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And if you're already using Gmail, any integration with Gmail would be great.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   You know, I had another idea for one of the things about Web 2.0.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Maybe what it means is Web 2 Microsoft zero.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   John, you just wrote a column saying Web 2.0 was just Web 1.0 re-warmed and equally dumb.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's the same, you know, what you have to do is just, I think there's been some lists put on some websites and some blogs where it shows you, you know, the old name and the new name.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It's the same thing.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   They just renamed all these things.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Think free office rightly.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Well, there was a discussion about that at E-Tech too.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I don't know who said I wish I could remember, but somebody said that Web 2.0 really is the same thing as Web 2.0.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   But what happened in the meantime is that the investment community came in and popped the bubble or created a bubble and popped it.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So this is essentially the geeks taking the web back from the investment community.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I think there was nothing wrong with Web 2.0 except that there wasn't a business model for a lot of these.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And now that banner advertising is successful and you can make some money, I don't, I mean, yeah, you might see some overheating.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I think Google's snapping up rightly so quickly is probably some evidence of that.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   But is Web 1.0 was it so very flawed?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I mean, who cares that it was a, you know, investment bust?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Well, except that somebody needed to put a new spin on it so people would pay attention to it.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   The techies are doing the same stuff we did all along.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   We never stopped.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Right.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So it's a continuum.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I think John's writing that sense.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Well, you know who else never stopped?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Is Amazon and eBay and John pointed this out that some of those companies just kept on going?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   So, you know, if you stayed in business, you, by at this point, you'd be doing pretty well for yourself.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Right.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Most of the companies that, you know, a lot of these guys, you always have to remember these investors pulled the plug on some of these guys.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And then a lot of companies had, you know, a lot of companies did an IPO and then all that money, the real money that was made on the IPO was made by the middleman.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   I mean, the company, if they sold the stock for 10 bucks and it flew to 100, the company didn't get that $90.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Right.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Everybody in the middle did.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Now, the thing that's interesting about Google is that they did an auction IPO, which means all the money that was raised by the IPO and where that stock was going to head, all went to Google.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Well, nobody said the guys running Google were stupid.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And they're also in the rare position of actually having, you know, the entire, you know, Wall Street salivating so desperately they were willing to do anything it would take to get any kind of an idea.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Well, the way I looked at it is that if everybody had done back then what Google did today and actually absorbed those profits, you know, from the stock going up into the company instead of, you know, getting it, you know, the winners being the middleman.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   I think half of these companies that went out of business would probably still be in business.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I don't.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I don't.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Does it mistake to kind of confuse the investment community and what it's doing with actual technology and innovation?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I mean, well, not one there.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   The one span the bills.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   So you're saying that by sucking up all the capital, it kept it kept these good companies from from surviving.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Well, I'm not saying I agree with Patrick that they're not all these companies for good.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I mean, some of these ideas were idiotic, but there's a number of the things that could have done at least as well as, you know, some of the my space kinds of things.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I think if you look at all the recent acquisitions and compare them to what we saw five or six years ago, all the acquisitions today are the companies are being led by their founders and those founders are developers.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And if you look back at 2000, 1999, I think at that point, people were acquiring companies.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   There were much more inflated and the management were a quote professional managers.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   They had already replaced the developers.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So these are earlier stage acquisitions, which are essentially almost pure technology.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So it's a different world.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And developers are willing to have their company stay small so that they can reasonably maintain control.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   That's right.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I mean, they're looking for the Google acquisition as opposed to a venture round.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Right.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Well, a couple million dollars in pocket is a lot better than a theoretical, you know, 50 million dollars that turns into a 30 million dollar tax debt, you know, because you can't pay off, you know, your mock earnings off of the sale.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I mean, if you look at some of it, it just seems like so much of what a lot of people learn was it's, you know, you know, the IPO is just kicked a lot of people's asses venture capital kicked a lot of people's asses.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   You know, when you were watching, it was one thing to have like, you know, we're the emergency site that's going to be tracking.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I mean, how many sites were there dedicated to basically to have lawyers and other urban professionals, you know, be able to track their time, you know, in two minute chunks for billing, right?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Okay, there's room for a couple of those companies.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   But I remember watching like the fifth one open up and we'll receive 11 million dollars in VC funding and you were just watching, you know, okay ideas to begin with that there would be like, you know, four more VCs would be like, oh my God, you know, that's right.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   The money's going to be and then they would invest on it.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And it was just a mess to watch and then they'd never ship products or they'd be spending money.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I remember watching somebody who had all of this insanely expensive office space downtown, you know, then turn around and buy a retail building to convert it into their main office building in a, you know, in a retail section of San Francisco.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And it's just like, what are you insane?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   You're peeing away money on, on.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Well, you know, these guys were almost encouraged to do that kind of crack, crackpot stuff by the again by the investors.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I think we're a little off topic here.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   We should probably get back to what was it?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Was there anything new with the show besides the sudden discovery that Web 2.0 is Web 1.0?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Well, there was a lot of new stuff.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   What else happened to the E-TEC?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Well, I think one of the themes sort of continuing from last year was micro formats.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   That's one that's sort of been on the back burner.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   It's structured content in the form of calendar data or contact data, you know, simple things.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But when you put them together, they're fairly powerful.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   One of the things that was hyped a bit, I didn't fall for it, I don't think.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   But this was Ray Aussie showing his basically smart web-based copy paste thing, which I think has been shown other places.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Okay.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   It's a clipboard that's Web.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   It's Web or the Web.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   For the Web.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Right.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   So the idea is that you, just like you find something on Microsoft's desktop environment, you copy it from one application and paste it to another, why can't you do that on the Web?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Why can't you find an address or an RSS feed or some other structured object and paste it from one environment to the other?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   There was a lot of hype around it.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I either missed the point or didn't fall for it.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   But there is the part of it.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   You had a blogger.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I guess that's true.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   If you were a big blogger, it would be handy.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   You could cut and paste.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   But it's not text.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   It's structured data.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And when you got listened to the presentations by the calendar guys and the other micro format guys, and there were many presentations about those kinds of tools, it makes some sense.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Are they talking about using kind of an XML under code so that everything can, I mean, that is one of the big issues right now for users is the formats are all over the place.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Yeah, the theory is, you know, Ray is out there saying, well, Microsoft is going to get behind this and it's going to be completely open.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Now, if Ray is saying that, I believe it.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   If Ray is part of Microsoft is saying that I'm not sure I do.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   He was using Firefox to demonstrate this, I noticed.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Oh, is that right?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   I was in the other room listening.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Maybe it doesn't work in Internet Explorer.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   So that was one of the big things.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And I guess the only other big topic which again is something we've seen before it, meetings like E-Tech is the whole Ajax thing, which comes back to the word processing and so forth.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   So there are a lot of people developing Ajax based applications.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And now people are also sort of going to Ajax 2.0, which I just made up, but it's essentially recognizing that the performance of Ajax can be problematic.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   So a couple of proposals, one called Comet, for example, as a way to mitigate some of the performance problems of an Ajax architect.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   It's a faster Ajax, sir.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Yeah, just smarter.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   It just recognizes that you can't send half a dozen XML packets for every keystroke.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Getting back to what Ray Aussie was doing, I like the idea, if you could get people to agree, he demonstrated apparently copying an event from event for the first time.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And then you can get an event from eventful and pasting it into Microsoft's live calendar.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   But you've got to get eventful to agree and a Microsoft to agree and everybody else to agree.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   How realistic is that?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   I think it is because the micro format guys seem to be looking for anybody who will adopt their standards.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   They've created these standards and no one's showing up to the party.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And so if Microsoft turns around and says, "We'll endorse them and we'll put them into our products," there's plenty of motivation then for everybody else to adapt.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   VCal or Vcards? Is it something new and different?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   No, it includes VCal and Vcards.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It includes all that stuff, but it's more.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Right.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And then there are people looking at what is the...
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   The question is, what is the semantic component?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   If you paste an RSS feed into a webpage, what does that mean?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Does that mean you just get a little orange button?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Or do you get the content of the feed?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Or what does it mean?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   So there's more work to do.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I think we should get Dave Wider to work on this.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   That would really help.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Thanks, yeah.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   That solved the whole problem.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Anything exciting to see?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Well, I can tell you one thing that C-bit revealed, which was Microsoft's origami.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Did you go see that, John?
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I got the demo and I took the...
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Played with it and I got the lecture from Bill Mitchell, the head guy who did the thing.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   He was in the handover to promote it.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   There was a bunch of TV reports that were done on it.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Let me summarize.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   It's a small notepad.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   But no keyboard.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   No, actually, there's no keyboard, but I've got some stuff.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I think tomorrow or Tuesday for sure, PCMag.com will have a slide show that I'll be putting up tomorrow.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Some of the pictures I took at the show and they'll have a lot of...
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Well, at least two or three pictures of the...
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Well, at least one pick...
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Nope, couple.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   The origami device and some of these ideas that I've got.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   It's a nice little thing.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   It's no big deal.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   It could have a keyboard, I guess.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   There's no...
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Yeah, no, you can have a keyboard too.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Yeah, it only has two and a half hour battery life.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   There was somebody on television from Microsoft, maybe it's the same guy who said, "The target
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   market was soccer moms who have five or ten minutes while they're waiting for their kids."
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   I'm thinking that's not a much of a market.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I asked them specifically about this and they wouldn't tell me.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   I asked them specifically about their market research and what they...
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I think he said, "We can't say."
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Bill Gates wanted it.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   That's...
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   You know, that could be it.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Bill Gates would actually do the market research and make sure there was actually a market for it.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   I mean, the other thing is no US portable vendor is touching this.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   I know this is all Korean.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   It's a couple other vendors you've never even heard of.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Samsung's the main one.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   The first one comes out with three hours of battery life.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Physical specs are...
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   The thumb keyboard is definitely going to be in there for most people.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Keyboards are optional.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   It's basically a modified version of the tablet OS from Microsoft.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   It's like media center meets tablet PC with even less battery life than a PDA in a larger form factor.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Are the verticals going to want it?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Maybe, but hospitals and insurance adjusters seem happy with full-sized tablet PCs.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Are people going to want it at home?
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Well, do you want to spend $600 or $800 for one of these things for a 7-inch or smaller screen?
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Is this bigger than the Nokia 7770?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's a little bit bigger, isn't it?
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   No, it's a lot bigger.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   A lot bigger.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It's like half a screen.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Yeah, it's a good-sized paperback.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   No, it's bigger than that.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   It's about two thirds the size of a regular notebook.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   But, Patrick, you were all excited about the Sony ebook.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I mean, couldn't this be just...
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   It's kind of like an ebook.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Yeah, Patrick.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   It's not like an ebook at all.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Come on, Patrick.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Hold on.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Stop.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Pause.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Both of you.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   There's three things about the ebook.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   A whole bunch of storage, which is easy.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   The screen, which doesn't refresh, so it doesn't suck up battery life, doesn't kill your eyes.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And three, some way of getting content onto it.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   We'll find out whether or not Sony's screwed that up or not in a few weeks when the Sony reader
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   shows up.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   We're going to get one in for testing.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   But what it has is thousands of pages of battery life.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   There's a lot of storage on there, and the battery life is going to be phenomenal.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   But you can't watch movies on it or listen to music.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Well, you know, I mean, here's...
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   This is something that the entire industry's been going around and circles on since before I was writing about this stuff.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Is do we need single devices that are designed to do one thing really, really well?
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Or do we do another device that mostly does one thing and then half-asses for other things?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Does your GPS, you know, does your automotive navigational system also need to be an MP3 player?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Does your MP3 player also need to display movies?
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I'll tell you something.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   You know, I think that this little small tablet from Microsoft and Maca,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   if they had a cradle for it, it would make a great, great GPS device for the car,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   which was powered seriously.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   It's the right size and a good looking screen.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   It's a little big.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   If that's the biggest problem with it, it doesn't do any one thing, particularly well.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   By the way, that's why it's called origami.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Nobody mentioned this.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   I think I didn't write it in the column.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I just did one for Market, we'll watch about it.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   I asked him specifically, why was it called origami?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   He says, "Well, it's like..."
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Because I thought it was going to be something that folded up, right?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   He says, "Well, it's like a piece of paper."
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   You can fold it up different ways and it does different things.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Our device does all these different things.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Exactly what you described is why it was named origami in the first place.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Terrific.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Anyway, let me change the topic real quick and just say the real news of this show
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   seemed to me to be besides RFID, which was all over the place.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   It's like everybody's building this RFID gear.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   It's kind of frightening, actually.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   There are these new phones that you're going to be seeing.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   I think there's going to be your phone du jour, which looks like a regular phone
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   that the screen kind of gimbals and goes sideways.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   It looks kind of like a T.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   No kids do it.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Isn't that the 90s?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   The no-key and 90s?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Everybody had one of them.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   They were all like, "This big script."
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   So you can watch movies, I guess, sideways, or you can play games and have...
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   I thought it was...
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   That's origami.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Now, that's see, that's origami device.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   It folds up in different ways.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Yeah, that actually probably is more origami than the Microsoft product.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Samsung showed a 10 megapixel phone at CBIT.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I don't know what you would do with a 10 megapixel phone.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Very detailed.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I wonder if that's using the phobia on sensor because I didn't see that phone.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   That's pretty...
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And it is, by the way, just like the...
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   It's another one of those folding...
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Oh, no, actually, this one's not.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   The Grundig was the one that's kind of folding.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   That was a six megapixel.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   I don't have a question with what it's going to have decent optics.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   I mean, 10 megapixels of bad light is very detailed bad light.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   That's just kind of a cookie.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.800]   I think that's a number so that they can...
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.000]   For bragging rights more than anything else, right?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Well, retail salespeople love stuff like that.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Sure.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.500]   You know, the new Samsung phones got 10 megapixels and that's really the thing if you want the
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.000]   good photos of the kids.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Don't you, Leo?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   John, did you see any SED TVs there because I'm seeing now that they're saying SEDs will
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   be coming in about a year?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Yeah, there were these little bitty TVs that run on hand-held PCs or whatever, all over
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   the place.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Like lots of them.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Did you see that, Robert, that...
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Here's the announcement from Toshiba and Canon.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   They call this a major industry milestone.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.280]   A once in 50 years historical turning point for the TV industry comparable to the initial
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.960]   introduction of CRT.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.120]   This is that new SED.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   Have you seen...
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.920]   It has the potential.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.200]   It's a surface conduction electron emitter display.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.560]   Last time we talked about this, you said it was more like a CRT than an LCD.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.040]   Let me tell you something about that technology.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   That used to be called...
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.600]   If you ask anybody about that, it used to be called an FED, a field effect display or
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.360]   whatever, a field emitter.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.360]   Right.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.280]   These are called FEDs.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.760]   Two companies, probably the biggest bust in the history of Silicon Valley, was a company
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.440]   called Candelescent, I believe.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.520]   They billions of dollars essentially squandered.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.440]   Well, not that much, but close to it maybe.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.160]   But wherever the case is, this technology has never cut the mustard.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.520]   It's not going to happen that now it's over.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.320]   I think you're mixing up technologies.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   I'm pretty sure...
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   No, it's the same technology.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.400]   It's exactly the same technology.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.960]   It's just another Web 2.0, it's just renamed and kind of tweaked a little bit.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   Well, it's really Canon and Toshiba.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.920]   Two people you normally don't associate with display technologies per se.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.280]   I mean, the cameras and broadcast equipment, sure.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.360]   This is their baby as far as introducing not only a flat display technology, which initially
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.000]   they'll be 55 inches, at least that's what they reported back at CES.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.080]   But it also offers performance on a level above and beyond any other flat panel you
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.960]   can buy today, which, yes, when they first release, they will be expensive.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.240]   No, I'll tell you something else.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.240]   It won't work.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.840]   You mean it won't work.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.600]   We've seen them, haven't we?
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.600]   Yes.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.040]   Yes, that's our lab version.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.320]   Well, they had a dozen of them at least.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.560]   They had a dozen, what were they?
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:11.760]   36-inch 720p displays for demonstration purposes, showing everything from full motion video
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.160]   to rather challenging scenes.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.400]   Yes, it's all set up on their back end in hand massaged and whatnot.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.800]   But as a demonstration product, and after looking at enough bad TVs this past year in
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.720]   the consumer side of things, they have a potential technology that could easily end
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:33.120]   up wiping the floor with plows, mousse, and the LCD market as well.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   So would you delay?
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.120]   I mean, they say they won't start manufacturing.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.200]   Can we put some money on this dead end?
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.240]   They're not going to start manufacturing for another year.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.720]   They won't start shipping for another year and a half.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.720]   So this could be brilliant.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.520]   Is that the latest projected number?
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.760]   That's what she's been Canada saying now, that they're starting production in July,
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:26:00.160]   2007, and they want to get out by Q4 just in time for the 2008 Olympics, I think, is
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   where they're shooting for.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   It's the perfect timing.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.120]   Which does maybe give some credence to what John's saying.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.320]   I mean, if they had production models in January, but they're still not going to start making
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.240]   them until July 2007, there may be some issues.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.560]   They still have to resolve.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.000]   But then the guy in the New York Times today said that broadcast television is dead anyway.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Good point.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.760]   But we still will watch TVs, won't we?
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.080]   But anyway, there was a lot of little TVs at the thing, but they didn't have any of those
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   says that I saw.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.240]   I mean, there could have been.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:32.560]   I mean, that show, you have to remember that C-bit is the number of, they actually calculate
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.920]   the number of miles of aisles there are?
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.920]   30.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   Wow.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:44.480]   So how is it that you refuse to go to CES, which is a show arguably say 10 times smaller
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:50.280]   than even if it's C-bit, which is the granddaddy of all consumer electronics.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.080]   Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.600]   It's a pretty simple reason is that the CES is over-covered by American journalists and
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   C-bits not.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.920]   I mean, whatever I cover there is pretty much nobody else is covering it.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.160]   I mean, there's nobody, I mean, they have very few writers there from the USA.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.360]   So nobody gets any information.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.440]   But basically, I'm just reinventing the wheel down at CES.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   So what's the point?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.640]   And it would be interesting why it's like in gadget and a couple other places have been
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   doing some pretty good kind of--
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   Do they sense the people?
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.440]   And gadget's doing, they're doing the best job of covering these things.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.600]   They're coming on strong.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.560]   That's an interesting choice for them is maybe they become the trade show journal line.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.440]   But you know, as far as said, it's got one last comment was that it is a new technology
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.760]   and you could have said something very similar about the whole L-cost, the liquid crystal
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.760]   and so forth.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.760]   We did.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   I think we did.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   We did.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   We did.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.760]   We did.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.760]   We did.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.760]   We did.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   We did.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.760]   We did projection technology.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.200]   You could say that, you know, why bring in another technology that has, you know, it's
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.640]   going to have to compete against the LCD reproduction and the DLP reproduction.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.600]   They're so firmly entrenched right now.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.160]   Yet now, anybody who's in a market seriously for a new TV using reprejection is L-cost
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.640]   offers the best of all worlds at this point.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.520]   I think a year ago, we were saying L-cost was dead, that they couldn't get the chips out,
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.520]   the companies had given up.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.880]   I'm going back to that point of view, by the way.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.440]   Well Sony seems to be doing pretty well with its L-cost displays.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.160]   Yeah, no, I'm not saying that DK, I'm not saying it's impossible to make these things,
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.560]   but I was hanging out with one of the guys from one of the electronic buyers, a guy
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:22.720]   or electronic products, but a first publication and he's like kind of setting me straight
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.920]   on some of these things and L-cost is still a little bit on the cusp.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   Huh.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   Interesting.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.720]   Well, for projectors or for full-size screens?
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.160]   Just on the cusp period, there's some issues.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.840]   It's only a projection technology.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.840]   That's all it is.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   Well, that's why I said it's exciting.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.680]   Yeah, it's basically a projection.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:45.320]   So the problem with the projection technology is essentially is the Samsung invention, I
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   guess everybody's going to start doing this, the elimination of the color wheel with LEDs.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.160]   And they're going to use, and once you eliminate the color wheel, I mean, now there's no moving
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.400]   parts and things change, the cost structure changes dramatically.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.960]   And also you've gotten rid of the replaceable bulb and you replace it with LEDs.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.880]   That's our, you know, best thing.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.520]   I mean, it's going to be hard to compete with that kind of thing for projectors.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.240]   What was going on with RFID?
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.320]   There was a lot of RFID there.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.880]   It just seems to me that they're going to just RFID everything.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:25.720]   All of Europe wants to put RFID's on everything so they can track shipments of trucks and
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   everything else.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.920]   Mostly for tracking, but you can just see it's just headed to, you know, having people
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.920]   track to.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.840]   Do you get the sense that they're less concerned in Europe about privacy than we are here in
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.840]   the States?
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.560]   Well, it is going to be coming up in the conversation with RFID's.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.640]   I can tell you that's the first thing that comes up here.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.640]   You talk about.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.160]   I mean, what item that you buy in any major retailer doesn't have an RFID tag on it in
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   this country.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.840]   You walk into anything that has that protection system as you walk out of a.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.400]   But they take it off, right?
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.400]   No, they did.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.440]   So they fry the chip internally before they hand it to.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.280]   I mean, because you look at like a DVD packaging, the chip itself is built into the packaging
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.720]   and then they just have what that white strip is, that little white strip that's in there.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   Yeah, we're like a year.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   It's an RFID.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.040]   That's not an actual RFID tag.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.520]   Sure it is.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.520]   Are you sure?
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.200]   It contains them for I mean, all anything you put a serial number to and scan it or say,
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.360]   yes, I belong here or not here.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.200]   It's a crude version.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   It's a thing that you put in your handle or.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.680]   I think it's inevitable.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.760]   I think GPS everywhere, RFID everywhere.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.600]   And then nobody will ever get lost again.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   No, nobody, no thing will ever get lost again.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   No, that's that's that's the worst.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.200]   And then now I'm not even wishing for it.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   I'm dreading it.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   Are you kidding?
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.520]   Well, yeah, no, but I mean, it's you're still going to be able to get lost.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.200]   There's going to be a problem.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.080]   You know, there's going to be this half.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.280]   There'll still be huge swaths of the, you know, the American West that doesn't have
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   cell phone coverage.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.680]   I mean, proctoring gamble, it's like nuts.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.560]   They're claiming, you know, if they RFID tag everything, they're claiming that they can
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.880]   get some insane, like, save it like a billion dollars a year by producing, you know, lost
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.840]   product lost in shipping and shrinkage.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.080]   But then the, you know, then you turn around and you're looking and you start to realize
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:14.160]   it, you know, RFID tags don't work really well if you would say have, you know, six
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.320]   containers full of dishwashing soap because the RF gets absorbed by the liquid inside the
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   containers.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.720]   There's still a lot of stuff to be worked out to make this work.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.360]   I have faith.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.320]   I think they're more than out, more than out to them.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.880]   We think I bought a shirt a couple of weeks ago, you know, and they took off the big white
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.920]   plastic tag and I got it home and a little tiny tag was inside the shirt.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.040]   So I'm not sure that we're not carrying around more tags than we think.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.600]   That's what I'm saying here.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   Where there's no problems.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.000]   So what do you have to do just microwave everything you buy?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Yes.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   I've been looking.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.640]   I mean, you now, a number more and more phones, you know, phones have had GPS capability or
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.080]   location capability for a long time, but more and more phones are supporting things like
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.640]   telling them that where you basically your phone is a GPS device and you just dial it
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.200]   in and it's pretty cool.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.280]   I think when it works, it's great.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.280]   Yeah, it's a great idea.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:13.000]   So we, of course, the Intel developers forum was going on in Silicon Valley this week and
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.840]   Intel actually scooped Microsoft by showing the origami a little bit early, but they also
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:23.640]   showed some new chips and of all things, a water cooling system for overclockers.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.640]   We sent Will, well, we didn't send him.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.880]   He was there, but we talked to Will Harris from BitTech, which is a great UK enthusiast
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   site and he gave us his lowdown on the Intel developers forum.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.640]   There's a, I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff there this time.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:46.520]   The big news was Intel released what it calls its new core micro architecture, which is going
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:51.160]   to debut in its new processors, which are called Conro.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.920]   And Conro is going to be the chip basically that ends up in the new Apple Max.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.120]   Oh, interesting.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.640]   So Conro, we successor to Corduo.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.800]   Well, it's sort of.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.040]   Yeah, it's kind of the successor to the old Pentium 4.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.560]   And so when when Apple says, well, we're going to hold off on replacing the power max
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.960]   until the end of the year, they're waiting for this chip, basically.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   Is it what is it?
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960]   Conro to be finished.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.600]   Is it, is it Yona part two or where does it fit in the road?
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.000]   It's an, it's, it's an evolution.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.640]   So if you take the original Pentium M, which was such a massive success for Intel, because
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.400]   it's just like, hey, Israeli designers who are just done.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.640]   Yeah, the Israeli guys, it turns out, you know, we can make a really high powered processor
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.320]   that really doesn't consume any heat.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.480]   And they said, well, let's move that onto the desktop.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.640]   And so this is what you've seen now with them core duo and core solo, which is in all
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   the new Mac stuff.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.360]   And that was called named Yona, right?
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.600]   And those were, gosh, yes, Yona.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   And I think Banias.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.240]   You're Banias was kind of an M, yeah.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.840]   And then the Yona was a successor to that.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.840]   They have too many codename.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   I know.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.040]   And now so, as the successor to Yona.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.200]   So Conro is the successor to that.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   And there's three products.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.520]   There is a conero, which is desktop, Meron, which is laptop and woodcrest, which is server,
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.760]   which you know, you don't really care about.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:14.040]   But they're all based on this new core micro architecture, which is.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.800]   Instead of doing, instead of having everything go faster and scaling clock speeds all the
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.240]   time, we'll make it more efficient and we'll make it wider.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.440]   So the core micro architecture has like four execution engines in each core instead of
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.960]   three compared to the last generation.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.680]   So immediately you just add on a bunch of capacity there.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:42.200]   It's got all kinds of new logic engines for rearranging and combining processor instructions
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.880]   and better ways of accessing memory.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.960]   And it's got a more intelligent way of sharing cash between the dual cores.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.400]   And basically it's just designed to be really efficient, really fast, really sleek.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.320]   It's going to deliver a hell of a lot more performance for a hell of a lot less power.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.040]   It's is it all dual core?
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.120]   With a have a solo?
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.520]   It's all dual core from now on, I think.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.080]   They don't care about solo.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   Not at all.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.080]   How about quad core?
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.040]   I said, recently even talk about absolutely not.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.480]   So they actually demoed for the first time quad core in a gaming chip.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.080]   There's a gaming chip called I think it's called Kentsfield, which is due to arrive in
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.320]   January 2007.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.280]   And that is for physical cores.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.880]   It's going to be fast as heck.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.480]   They showed it playing, do you know the Guild Wars MMO?
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.200]   So they showed it running Guild Wars.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.360]   And you know, it looked pretty good.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.680]   I bet it looked pretty good.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.560]   Now are they hyper threading these at all or is that dead?
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.600]   No, I think they're dropping hyper threading.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.920]   Hyper threading was a great way to get people introduced to the idea of parallelism.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.200]   But it's really not that efficient now when you've got so much, so much actual hardware
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   to do that instead.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.640]   Now on bit tech.net, I know you've benchmarked Conroe already.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.360]   I don't know how you did it so fast.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.800]   Well, we had, I mean, we were kind of lucky.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:06.000]   We had Intel decided, you know, hey, we actually quite like you guys.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.240]   We'll let you come and have a go on this system.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   That's fantastic.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:15.320]   And so the guys that are on tech actually got to spend a fair amount of time just benchmarking
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.320]   it.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.000]   Intel had a Conroe system and an AMD FX60 system.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.080]   If you know the AMD Proline, the FX60 is like the hardcore gamer product.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.560]   And they were showing, hey, this is a lot faster than the AMD system.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.440]   And Anzac published that.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.560]   But then there was lots of controversy about like, well, hey, you're publishing results
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.920]   from an AMD system that's being configured by Intel.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.920]   Right.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.720]   So who knows what they've done to that.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   No, I agree.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.720]   That's a little suspicious.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.160]   So we, so when we went in, we had the chance and we said, hey, actually, forget about the
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.560]   AMD system in the corner.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.920]   We just wanted to run one of our benchmarks on the Conroe system so we can compare it
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.120]   to all the systems that we've done in the labs back home.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.600]   And you use fear for your demo.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.120]   So fear was something they had installed.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.480]   It was fairly easy to run.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.520]   And it's something that we've seen in our labs is gives a really good indication of CPU
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.520]   scaling.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   If you crank back the resolution and you crank back all the details, basically you become,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.880]   you take the graphics out of the equation, you become really CPU limited as to how fast
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.600]   can the CPU just keep churning this stuff out.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.600]   Perfect.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   That makes the graphics.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.600]   Absolutely.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.280]   So we ran that on there and we compared it to our results from the labs back home and
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   it was just stonking.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.280]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.040]   It was really, really like an order of magnitude faster.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.480]   And then RM really well configured AMD system at home.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:43.040]   Your Pentium XC955, which is your reference, was at 213 frames per second, which by the
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.560]   way is pretty fast.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.560]   Absolutely.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   346 for Conroe.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:52.840]   And even better, you take the top end system, you can buy an FX60 machine.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.840]   That was 253.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.920]   You're adding on like a whole another 100 frames a second.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.480]   It's more than 30% faster.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.760]   So it looks really, really, really good.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.080]   That's truly amazing.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.080]   So Conroe is the thing to look at.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:11.040]   I know they also showed though prototypes of origami.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.520]   So they have another product.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.960]   So they kind of pre-announced that for Microsoft.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.120]   Microsoft must be a little annoyed.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:24.360]   Well, they made a big thing about, you know, we're going to announce it on Thursday at
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.360]   Seabed in Germany.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   Right.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.360]   But of course, you know, we were all standing around on Monday going, hey, we're looking
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   at this right now.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   Here it is.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.360]   Here it is.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.040]   And so they had a bunch of different concept machines.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.240]   They had a couple of actual retail machines that they were showing.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.880]   And it was, I don't know, I'm not sure I can get very excited about it.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.960]   It's kind of like just a tablet PC, but a bit smaller, but not really small enough.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   Right.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.960]   It's not like you can put it in your pocket.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   No, I agree.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.760]   Maybe you can put it in a handbag.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.160]   Since I know very well, I don't know about your carry pads.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.440]   It's not got a cell phone in it.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440]   Right.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.240]   And so it's not like you can replace your cell phone.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:10.440]   So it's kind of just like, well, I'll take it on the plane and watch some movies.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.640]   But what else am I actually going to do with it?
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.240]   Microsoft just won't let go of this tablet PC idea.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.360]   In fact, this is not much different than their tablet that they announced.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.840]   I can't remember if it was a call the HPC.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.000]   The idea was you'd kind of be sitting in your living room, controlling your TV with it,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   which it's just never caught on.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.040]   No, it doesn't really work.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:33.360]   And it's certainly not when the origami speculation came out, it was Microsoft is reading an iPod
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.600]   killer.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.520]   And this is certainly not by any stretch of the imagination an iPod killer.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.960]   It's an entirely different usage model.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.400]   And I don't think it's a uses model that says popular.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.720]   I mean, you've got to spend like a thousand bucks on one of these things.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   We're talking to Will Harris.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:55.000]   He's the editor at bit-tech.net, a British tech enthusiast website, a great website.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.160]   He's been at the Intel developers forum for the last few days.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:06.560]   I noted that Don McDonald took a little swipe at Apple at his keynote.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   Tell us about that.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   Absolutely.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.960]   Well, I mean, Don is a fellow Brit and he's got a kind of rice sense of humor and he doesn't
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.680]   like to be outdone on anything, I don't think.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.440]   I mean, he invented the marketing concept for Centrino.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.720]   So he's a pretty clever guy.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   No kidding.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.240]   We had a good raise for that one.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.800]   But he was saying, basically he alluded to the fact jobs in his keynote a while back when
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.200]   he announced Front Row.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.920]   We're saying, hey, we've got this new Apple remote.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.240]   And it's only got six buttons.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.680]   It's just got the little circle.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.280]   It kind of looks like an iPod shuffle.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.560]   Look at how stupidly complicated our competitors remote controls are.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.880]   And they showed the Windows Media remote, which has like 50 buttons on something.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.400]   I mean, kind of skipping over the fact that Windows Media 7 does about five times the
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   thing that Front Row does.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.000]   You only need six buttons on Front Row.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Absolutely.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   We gloss over that.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.640]   But Don said, you know, hey, we thought of the challenge was can we make a remote control
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.800]   with with node buttons?
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.400]   Can we best Steve Jobs?
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:11.560]   And so he showed some basically voice control of Windows Media Center.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   So basically the premise was you say, hey, computer, what time is Family Guy on TV?
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.560]   And the computer goes, let me think about that.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.640]   And it searches the guide for Family Guy and brings you up.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.480]   And then you can say, hey, record this episode of Family Guy and it automatically records
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.480]   for you.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   So does it work?
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.440]   Well, the problem was it took him about five goes to actually get it to work.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.400]   And then on the stage going, computer, what time is Family Guy on?
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.880]   I don't really know what you're talking about.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.440]   That's my problem with all of these.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.680]   Exactly what always happens.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.880]   If computer like on on and you end up shouting.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.880]   And it really.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.280]   And the trouble is, you know, you got multiple systems in your house and you say computer,
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.480]   record Family Guy and you got five systems in the same room.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.240]   We'll start recording Family Guy, you know.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.200]   So that wasn't particularly a compelling demonstration.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.800]   Anything else you saw there that you found interest to the idea?
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   I mean, they had them.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   You're aware of the sort of, of the kind of liquid cooling enthusiast hobby of taking
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   your site.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.400]   They got, they got an extreme addition to five gigahertz.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.480]   So the idea is that, you know, you see for years, for years we've had water cooling systems
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.800]   in PCs where you, you know, you have a reservoir and a pump and you throw that right into
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   some tubing.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   That's pretty cool, right?
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   And they're quiet.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   And they're cooler.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.800]   You can overclockwise.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   But Intel has decided, well, hey, we're going to try and take this to the next level.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.200]   We want to, we want to make something that does the same thing, but which we can ship
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.720]   in a whole bunch of systems.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.600]   You can't really ship a water cooling system because, you know, a tube burst, you've got
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.600]   water going everywhere.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   Right.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.320]   So they said, well, we're going to, we're going to make a water block that sits on the
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   CPU.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:54.280]   We're going to integrate a centrifugal pump into the water block.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   Wow.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.600]   So that all is like one solid unit.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.560]   And then we're just going to have that go through some metal pipes to a heat exchanger,
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.240]   like a traditional radiator.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.160]   And what they did was, you know, Intel's R&D is pretty, has a pretty nice budget, has
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.160]   a lot of expertise.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.560]   And they were just able to take this concept of water cooling far beyond what the kind
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.920]   of niche industry that it always has been has been able to do.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:24.360]   And so they had, yeah, a penny extreme edition, which ships at 3.8 gigahertz, and they had
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.280]   that up over five gigahertz.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.280]   Wow.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:32.200]   Still operating well, well within temperature ranges that are acceptable.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   Wow.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.560]   And it was just sort of like, wow, you can suddenly, it's going to be $50 because they
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.440]   made sure that when they created it, they used easily available components, you know,
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.800]   stuff that if you're a CPU maker, you can just go and get out and shine your water.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.880]   It works on an ATX motherboard or a BTX.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.880]   And it works on either of them.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.760]   You just, you know, you plonk it on, you set up your heat exchanger, make sure the pipes
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   are okay.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.120]   And it looks like a really elegant solution.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.000]   Isn't a little strange to see Intel promoting overclocking?
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.560]   I mean, it seems like that's the last thing they'd want.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.440]   Well, that is exactly what I said to the guys.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.080]   And actually, you know, it's quite a good story.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   There is inside Intel, you know, Intel, as you say, is a very kind of anti overclocking,
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.800]   very by the book.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.440]   There is a little team of enthusiasts that works in the Intel R&D department.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:21.160]   And they had this look a secret society and they have a meeting every week.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.800]   You know, on a Friday, they're going to find like a spare room somewhere in Intel.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   It's like invitation only.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.720]   You can't turn up unless you've been like verified as one of these enthusiastic kind
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.720]   of people.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:37.960]   And they just sit there and brainstorm ways to make Intel products more friendly to enthusiasts.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.400]   You know, these guys are enthusiasts themselves.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:45.200]   And so they set up these secret clubs and they've done stuff like so.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.840]   They got this product green lighted and they got it, you know, you're going to see this
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.720]   being rolled out for the rest of the year as a really good and out of the box performance
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   cooling system.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.720]   I would buy it a minute, especially when you tell you know it's going to work, you know?
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.520]   And it's been, you know, verified.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.240]   It's going to work for at least three years.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.560]   And are they saying to use it?
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.920]   Are they saying to overclock with it or are they just saying use this?
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   Absolutely.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.720]   I mean, they're putting more overclocking features onto their main boards.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.360]   One of the things they also showed was that they've started putting heat sinks on the
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.760]   voltage regulators on the motherboard.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.640]   And of course, the only reason you'd ever put heat sinks on a voltage regulator on
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.320]   a motherboard is to crank up the voltage regulators a lot.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.200]   And so they're really getting Intel to move away from this.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.000]   Hey, we're not going to do anything in this area.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.560]   So hey, actually, maybe we could make some money in this.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.840]   You know, this works so well.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.080]   I actually, I think hell is actually freezing over right now.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.080]   Unbelievable.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:48.560]   And I think, you know, they're, they really are starting to get it a little bit.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.600]   Well, I want to thank you so much.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:55.440]   This has been great to get your perspective on the Intel developer forum, which is wrapping
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.440]   up.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.440]   We're just wrapped up.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:01.400]   We're recording this on Thursday the ninth for more information bit, B.I.T.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.400]   dash tech T C H dot net.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.800]   You're going to put more articles up.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.040]   There's some great stuff on there.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.200]   And I have to say, this is going to be a book marking.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.720]   It's going to be a regular visit.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.400]   Well, thank you very much, Leo.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.520]   Thanks very much for having me.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   Really appreciate it.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:20.800]   Will Harris, editor of bit tech dot net with the IDF update.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.160]   And Leo, before you go to that, I'm going to take off.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.160]   Okay.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.160]   So I'll see you guys next week.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.080]   I'm actually we're back already.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.960]   We're never mind.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.440]   I'll let you back.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.200]   But I will let you go because it is like getting it's almost two o'clock in the morning.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.560]   So yeah, I got to get the bed.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.960]   I got to really play tomorrow.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.560]   I'm only staying up because of our fantastic fans who listen to the show.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   Thank you, John.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.560]   It's wonderful.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.560]   You're going to be stuck up, John.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.120]   You're going to be back next week.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.680]   I'll be back.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.080]   I'm going to be back tomorrow.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   I mean, essentially.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.560]   So I'll see you guys.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.880]   Safe for home.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.880]   Thank you, John.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.880]   Thanks.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.880]   Good night.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.880]   Good night.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.120]   Hello, Leo.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:05.080]   Speaking of Intel and Microsoft, what's the what's the story about EFI?
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.280]   I wasn't familiar with EFI until you pointed it out to me.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.280]   Let me bring that up.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.960]   And then I would like to get kind of especially Robert and Patrick, your take on Intel's announcements
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:19.640]   at IDF because there's some interesting stuff coming out of there.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.440]   One of the kind of surprising announcements from Microsoft this week was that they are
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:30.880]   not going to support the new EFI BIOS, something they co-jointly developed with Intel.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:37.840]   In Vista, they're going to stick with the 20-year-old BIOS, which is kind of a surprise.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.600]   It's just one more thing that's being pulled out of Vista, if you ask me.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.080]   EFI stands for the Extensible Firmware Interface.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:49.920]   And irony of ironies, Apple's already using it in their Intel Macs.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.680]   And I think one of the reasons people paid attention to this, although I don't think
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.840]   it's the most important part of the story, is that it means that Vista won't boot on
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.320]   any of these Mac intels because they need EFI support.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:05.760]   But more than that, I think it's Microsoft saying, "God, we can't even support our own
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.400]   technology EFI in our brand new operating system.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.560]   What's going on with Vista?"
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:14.360]   Well, I think they're doing it for 64-bit PCs, not 32-bit.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:20.880]   They say it won't appear until Vista Server edition, and it requires 64-bit.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:25.680]   But Mac's doing it with 32-bit.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:31.080]   Would that be the reason or the means that they will keep the OS from migrating so easily
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.080]   then to the Apple app?
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.080]   I wonder what they want to, though.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.280]   I don't understand why they want to prevent that.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.240]   It's more money for them if they sell more, if it runs on more hardware.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.080]   Why would it be...
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:48.000]   Or will this also give the Windows side with all of its user base as big as it is?
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:55.360]   Will that just give more people the option than to try out the OS on their existing hardware?
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   Maybe.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.360]   Maybe that's it.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.840]   Maybe it's an upgrade issue.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:04.040]   I mean, some of the reports I'm reading on this says Vista will support EFI on 64-bit
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.040]   processors.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:12.240]   Windows XP will support it through basically amounts to a compatibility module.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.680]   This is Andrew Ritz, who's the Microsoft Development Manager who's talking to IDF.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:21.560]   He said there will never be any support for booting Windows via EFI on systems with 32-bit
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.560]   processors.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.240]   He'll only be on 64-bit, and EFI will not be seen in any version of Windows until the
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.560]   release of Longhorn Server.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.440]   Yeah, but aren't they supposed to deliver server at the same time?
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   Yeah, but nobody's...
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   Are you buying server?
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.440]   Are you just going to buy Vista, right?
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.760]   No, he just said it's not going to appear anywhere until that.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.840]   Maybe that means they just need to finish the code and then they can...
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.800]   Maybe they'll put in everything then.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:55.240]   Because they've also said that 64-bit processors and they've also said in other places that
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:00.440]   they'll fundamentally be a bootstrapping device to get EFI to get older operating systems
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.440]   or for EFI.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:08.240]   But you know, they've been doing some funny things that's weak of forced operating system
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.080]   upgrades lately.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.080]   It said...
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.080]   Yeah, Windows XP.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.600]   Yeah, they said Friday.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.480]   Windows XP will boot under EFI when a compatibility support module is present.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.480]   When it is.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.840]   Because I write that, I don't know.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.440]   Yeah, when they ship that.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:29.280]   It said the decision to "reprioritize EFI development to the server version of Windows
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.280]   was based on a lack of available desktop PCs with EFI."
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:37.520]   So it's a chicken and egg thing where nobody supports it so they don't have to support
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.320]   it in software.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:45.400]   And then again, quoting Ritz, "No combination of factors changed our plans.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:51.200]   The big one in my opinion was platform availability with this huge move to 64-bit based platforms
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.600]   and for us to support it, we needed to see a large heterogeneous sample of 64-bit implementations."
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.760]   So basically it's saying there's not enough 32-bit hardware out there.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:05.000]   So does it mean that for us Mac hardware fans that the Windows issue is completely dead
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.520]   or is this something that's hackable?
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.360]   Well, it's dead for now.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.360]   It's exactly hackable.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.760]   Yeah, I mean once they release the module I suppose you could do it.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:18.680]   I'm always pleasantly surprised, shocked, and amazed by what hackers come up with.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:24.160]   I mean you saw the Linux running on a nano and they've got MAME running on Linux running
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.520]   Pac-Man on a nano.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.960]   So in fact somebody built a little arcade case that was nano-sized.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.960]   You insert the nano into the arcade case.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:34.960]   That's cool.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.520]   I didn't see if it had a little tiny little track ball but obviously you're right.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:45.440]   There are people with a lot more time on their hands than common sense.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.560]   So what about this?
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:52.960]   The first thing that shocked me was that there was some very interesting stuff out of IDF.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:58.240]   But I think when Will said that Intel was showing a water-cooled system and encouraging
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.200]   overclocking, I mean that's a shocker.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   Very cool.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:09.320]   Intel's also admitted that AMD's are running faster and Intel's like two years.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:15.720]   They've gone from clock speed on processor is the most important marketing tool we have
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.320]   in the retail market space to doing the BMW style and learning system.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.920]   They've gone and now they're saying it's all about reducing power consumption.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.840]   It's all about making corporate buyers happy and also, hey, reducing your home electricity
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.840]   bill.
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:35.720]   So I think they're finally reacting to AMD's success.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:39.240]   And saying what the heck, I mean how many people, is it going to cost them anything that
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:43.520]   people are overclocking until processors I don't think?
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.280]   I don't know how much they were excited about overclocking so much as they were the Intel
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.640]   advanced liquid cooling technology.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.800]   And they certainly were.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.800]   But they...
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.920]   I remember for the Pentium 4 launch though, they did a similar thing where they at least
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.080]   they showed what cooler they were using but I believe they had a completely sealed box
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:05.080]   and they just sat there and ramped up the frontside bus speed until the thing finally
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   froze.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.080]   But it hit like 4.5 gigahertz back in the day when it actually meant something.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.080]   True, true.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   All right.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.600]   It's nice to actually see them come up with a decent cooler that can actually support,
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:21.920]   hey, maybe their previous Prescott parts as well, which were incredibly notorious for
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.440]   being arguably the hottest CPUs you could put into a computer.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:31.000]   And their own Intel's own coolers sometimes weren't enough under certain case designs
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.600]   and certain airflow designs to keep up with the heat.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.520]   That thing was capable of putting off.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:43.320]   So it's nice to see them focusing on as much as the low power per computing part, the fact
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:48.840]   that they can make them more efficient and change the architecture to do more with fewer
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:52.640]   pipelines and also the smaller build processes.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.520]   But just on top of that, put a good cooler on top.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:00.480]   You can see, you know what, here, even if you want to overclock down the road, you'll
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.760]   have the headroom and the coolers available for you to do that as well.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:11.680]   And as Will said, new chip architecture, Conroe, Merrim and Woodcrest for respectively desktop
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.680]   laptop and server.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.600]   What do you think of these Conroe chips?
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:20.800]   I mean, I'm watching people who cover chips for a living or literally like, I mean, we
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:28.840]   had Lloyd Case was on talking about Conroe on Thursday's episode of DLTV and he's just
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:33.480]   stoked because they're looking at phenomenal performance improvements and phenomenal
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:40.440]   reductions in power consumption and a pretty heavy re-architecture that, you know, if it,
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.280]   you know, will wait until we actually have the chips in our hands to test them.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.600]   But it looks like they're going to be unbelievably fast.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.920]   Will's site had a did have some bench.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.000]   They were able to do some benchmarking at IDF and yes, absolutely stunning.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.080]   I want to see, you know, I want to see, I want to see shipping parts.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.080]   Oh, well, I agree.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.080]   I agree.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.880]   It always looks good when they're doing the demo.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.520]   But still pretty, pretty impressive.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:10.080]   And as Will said, this is clearly the chip that Apple was waiting for its high end machines.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   For the desktop.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   And it's amazing.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.000]   I mean, they've dropped the, they've dropped it's a 14 stage pipeline.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.320]   It's out of a 30 stage pipeline, you know, which slows down the clock frequency, but
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.320]   makes it a lot more efficient.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:25.480]   Isn't it funny because for a long time, the push was how big can we make this pipeline?
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:30.040]   And then they hit Prescott and it was, oh my God, it's not working anymore.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.800]   We've, we've gone too far.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.880]   So they're pulling way back on that.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.880]   It's pretty cool.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:39.640]   I mean, you know, each, each side of the core has 64 KVA L1 cache.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   Wow.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.200]   And there's like four megabytes of shared L2 cache into the sharing on the four megabytes
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.680]   L2 cache is dynamic.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.480]   It's going to be, I mean, it's going to be really interesting.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.040]   So me interesting to watch this does the Condro desktop performance and Marim does for
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.000]   mobile performance.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.640]   You know, and they're saying like the, you know, this, a lot of this doesn't actually
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.880]   require one of the things they've done is they set it up to the SSC instructions will
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:08.120]   take the entire like the SSC engine in 128 bits.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:13.560]   So they can now a single clock cycle, execute all, you know, an entire, all the SSC instructions.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:14.560]   Wow.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.560]   Awesome.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.960]   And you really see benefit there in, in transcoding and coding, in 3D gaming, you really see a
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.960]   big, big improvement.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.440]   Anytime you're working with a massive data, that's where you're really going to get some
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.840]   benefit of that.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.720]   So that's going to be, I mean, it's going to be interesting to see.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.240]   And it's supposed to ship by, you know, the end of this spring.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.920]   So if you're thinking about buying a notebook, man, or a desktop, it might be worth waiting,
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.960]   you know, a Merrim notebook would be pretty awesome.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.120]   I mean, I think that that might be the notebook I'm waiting for.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.400]   So Q2, Q3 of 2006.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.400]   That's when it's coming out.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.400]   Okay.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.920]   Any other stories you guys, we pretty much have used up our allotted time.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.560]   Is there anything else you guys?
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:02.200]   Well, there's one, one thing I liked that I saw at E-Tech was a company, EVDB, the events
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.200]   and venues database.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   Yeah, I like them.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   Yeah, they've got some great stuff.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:08.520]   Brian Deere, who was formerly with MP3.com, has hidden that up.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.360]   They want to be the IMDB of concerts and shows and events.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   They already are actually.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   They're doing a great job.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.000]   I mean, they don't have the scale perhaps yet.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.480]   But they came out with a really interesting concept there, which they call eventful demand.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.720]   And it's just interesting because you go to the site and you decide what event you'd
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:27.720]   like to see.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.720]   Oh.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:33.360]   And you create that event, then people participate and vote or whatever.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.400]   And I think you're going to see it.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.600]   That is an interesting sort of a part of it.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:42.800]   It's for fans to kind of get back to the promoters and say, "Hey, we need a Beatles
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:43.800]   reunion."
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.240]   It's just an interesting twist on one of the theme of the show this year was the attention
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.600]   economy.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:55.080]   And as Doc Sirls has said, maybe what it ought to be is the intention economy.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.400]   And so it's turning around and putting it in the hands more of the community.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.800]   Now, I have to say some of the demands are kind of interesting.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   I'm looking right now.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   And this is brand new.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   They've just launched it.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.160]   But demand number one, they want to see the impeachment of George W. Bush at the Washington
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.720]   Metro arena.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.240]   So obviously some people are being a little silly.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:17.200]   I thought this was kind of like Polestar only with interaction.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   What's Polestar?
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:26.160]   Well Polestar basically tracks pretty much all the major acts that tour in North America
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.520]   list their tours on here.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:34.040]   Well, you know, one of the top vote getters right now is our buddy Will Wheaton.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:38.880]   They want him to do an event at the San Diego Metro area.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:42.640]   No, I think it's sort of a...
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:45.120]   It's a meet up.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.620]   It's flash mobs.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.960]   It's all this sort of coming together in another form.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:54.200]   Well, you know it's only a matter of time before people start putting Twit on the road.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:58.800]   And I just want to stop you right there because unless you're going to pay for it, we ain't
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.800]   going anywhere.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.080]   It's tough enough to get everybody together by Skype.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.960]   How many people would pay $5 a piece?
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.240]   Well, if we get it, you know what?
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:09.480]   If we see a thousand people on there saying, you know, come to Tucson, I guess we would
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   have to come to Tucson.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   There you go.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   Don't you think?
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.480]   If they all came.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.480]   That's the problem.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:21.340]   You get the haul, you get all dressed up and you go and then five people show up and we're
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.340]   in trouble.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.140]   Maybe we should take the money first.
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.140]   Yeah, pay us.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.140]   Then we'll show up.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:27.140]   Then we'll show up.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:28.340]   I do want to put in a plug.
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:33.140]   The podcast Academy is holding a new event at Boston University at the end of April.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:37.940]   Go to podcastacademy.org and you can get more podcasting in two days than you'd ever
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:38.940]   want to see.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.620]   How much does it cost to take the...
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:41.620]   It is...
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:45.640]   If you do it before March 15th, it's only $250.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:46.640]   That's great.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:47.640]   Which includes some meals.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.000]   You'll know what the podcast Academy is.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.280]   The podcast Academy is part of the Conversations Network.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:57.760]   That's the nonprofit network that brings you IT Conversations.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.940]   And the podcast Academy is doing four events around the country this year and hopefully
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:07.320]   won an Australia in January to train people in the basics of podcasting.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.320]   That's great.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.240]   What we do is to record those events and we'll be putting those online as free online courses
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:16.280]   in podcasting technology and tools.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.280]   As always...
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.780]   I mean, it's actually point of view.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:24.620]   It's good wholesome nuts and bolts information and not just like go out and buy a $700 microphone.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.620]   That's really neat.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.420]   I should hope not.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.180]   We've got some great people.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.720]   This one we've got Tony Kahn from WGBH.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.120]   We'll be talking.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.640]   We've got Michael Gohegan from Great Radio and who produces the Disney podcast.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.440]   We've got people who are really in the top tier of podcasting and public radio talking
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:48.720]   about everything from the technology to the business side to podcasting and education.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.720]   That's awesome.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.720]   That sounds wonderful.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   Podcastacademy.org.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.720]   I was going to say, "Okay, podcastacademy.org."
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.960]   Of course, IT Conversations is at ITConversations.com.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.160]   And that's a great place to find about 3,000 podcasts.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.600]   And I forgot to tell you that membership in the Conversations Network is going to be
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.600]   now free.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.600]   Oh, really?
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.960]   We discovered that none of our social tools were being used if we made them available
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.440]   to paid members only.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.440]   Right.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.840]   So it's a nonprofit, but guest membership is now free to everyone.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.840]   Good.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.840]   That's great.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.840]   Well done.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.840]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840]   We appreciate it, Doug.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.840]   It's always great to talk to you.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.840]   A lot of fun.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840]   Thanks for your update on ETEC.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.840]   And have a great day.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.840]   Thank you.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.520]   Want to thank also, of course, you, Patrick Norton and Robert Herron for stopping by.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.520]   Hey, do we add on the show on Thursday?
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.520]   What?
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.520]   I'm going to tell you.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520]   Who?
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520]   We actually had Jeff Heimos.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.920]   We should meet Jeff Bates, aka Heimos from Slash.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920]   Oh, how cool?
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.920]   Which is really funny.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.400]   Oh, you're getting some great people.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   What did he talk about?
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.560]   It talked to him a bunch about sort of the history of Slash.how it came together and also
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.000]   about some of the stuff that's coming in the future, which includes some pretty serious
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.400]   mods to the interface involving ETEC.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   Oh boy.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.400]   Our friend Kevin has rolled out Ajax commenting now in the dig.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.800]   And it looks really slick.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   And I'm sure Heimos and the commander talk over looking at that going, hmm, we go do
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   little Ajax ourselves.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.800]   Oh, Ajax.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.520]   And the dl.tv to see that show and all of the shows.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:21.280]   And of course, John C. de Vorex knew cranky, cranky geeks, which is a lot of fun.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.000]   I look forward to another one of those.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   And Robert Herron, of course, joins you every, every day on dl.tv too.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.880]   Am I, am I right?
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   You are.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.880]   Right.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.880]   I am.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.880]   On Thursdays.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.720]   No, you do have Tuesday and Thursday, though.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.720]   Okay.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.120]   Two a week, but every day you can watch one if you want.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.040]   You know, you can watch them over and over.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.120]   You don't have to watch live.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.560]   You can watch much like my relationship between over and over.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.960]   It's like a day without sunshine.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960]   Thank you, Patrick.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.080]   Our thanks to AOL radio for providing us with the bandwidth and broadcasting the show
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:02.440]   on their podcast channel, AOL dot com slash podcasting.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.640]   If you want to know more, subscribe.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.600]   It's great online radio service.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:12.360]   You know, we're going to have our first advertisement on Twitter in a couple of months, I think.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.360]   Just one.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.360]   We're going to.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.000]   I'll tell you, I'll tell you when the time comes, but it's just one.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.240]   I just thought it'd be kind of interesting.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.680]   It'll be beginning the middle.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.040]   Will you, will you read it out?
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.840]   No, it's going to be prerecorded.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.320]   It'll be at the beginning.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.960]   It'll be short.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:32.360]   It's, I can't tell you what it is yet, but, but, and the only reason we're doing it
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.960]   is just to see what happens.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.960]   Ooh, there's.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.200]   Yeah, I'm very excited about this.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.960]   And Robert, by the way, we will be looking for an endorsement from you.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   All right, guys.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.840]   Have a great, have a great afternoon.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.400]   You know, the Sopranos are on the night.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:51.960]   I'm going to check out early because I got to get my sound on the oven to start baking.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.960]   Have a great day.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.760]   Another twin is in the can.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:55.760]   All right.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.760]   I should have paid attention.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.760]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.760]   Too much work.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.200]   The problem is there's no limit.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.200]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200]   So here's the deal.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a ton of blue screens.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   Like, forget it.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   I'm killing you.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200]   [LAUGHTER]
