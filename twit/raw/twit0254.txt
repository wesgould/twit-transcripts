[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.560]   This is Tuit, this week in tech, our 254th episode,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.280]   and the continuing saga, trying to understand
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.200]   what's going on in the world of tech.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.520]   And I'm so glad one of the original--
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.520]   Twitter is here.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.920]   Oh, that doesn't sound right.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.040]   One of the original people who tweeted--
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.680]   no, that doesn't sound-- Kevin Rose, my old friend, is here.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.280]   Hi, Kevin.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.000]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.520]   Good to see you.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.680]   We've got some big announcements from Kevin today.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.040]   Semi-big.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   One really big.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.720]   One huge.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.520]   And then one we don't know because you won't tell me.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.040]   That's right.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.480]   Also with this-- oh, Dr. Stone.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.640]   Yes, I'm in the house.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.720]   Dig 4 was my idea, even though you're wearing a shirt.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.240]   You like my shirt?
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.800]   That's amazing.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.600]   Thanks to T-shirts plus for sending me that.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.000]   It says Dig 4 was my idea because it was Kevin,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.760]   but I'll explain that later.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.960]   Hopefully it's everything you dreamed of over there.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.360]   Hopefully it's everything you dreamed of.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.080]   I'm thinking it is, but we'll see.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.280]   We're going to take a look at--
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.640]   that's news story one.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.440]   We're going to get a look at the brand new Dig 4
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.880]   and Kevin's very kindly offer to do this for the first time.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.880]   Do you want to hear first?
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.380]   Yep.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.880]   In public.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.080]   I suggest people get logged in now while we're going.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.280]   Well--
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.440]   Yeah, I was going to say--
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.320]   I can start with this.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.600]   So the little announcement is we're opening it up just
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.120]   for the first time, just to the Twitter audience right now.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.560]   So if you go to new.dig.com and then click on request
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.880]   and invite, once you do that, put in your Dig
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.400]   username and password, and it'll let you write in.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.360]   You are in.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.640]   So request and invitation, OK.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.720]   Oh, that's it.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.840]   You don't need to do anything special.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.880]   Nothing special.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.680]   And that lasts until 4.30 today.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.160]   Until 4.30, yeah.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.000]   4.30 Pacific.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.160]   So it's only for people who are watching live right
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.320]   at this moment.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.760]   Yep.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.200]   So I just tell the friend to come to the show.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.480]   Oh, man, this is so exciting.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.160]   Let me take it off here before I enter my password.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.360]   Wait, wait, wait, enter my email address.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.320]   Oh, I see.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.600]   I just click--
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.080]   I just--
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.520]   I don't need a password.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.160]   I just put request and invite, and then--
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   Oh, log in now.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.400]   Oh, good, good, good, good, good.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.160]   There we go.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.880]   It might not let you in until you actually--
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.240]   you have to request and invite first.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.080]   Let me in.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.680]   Let you in, sweet.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.040]   I think.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.680]   Is this new?
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.320]   Is this the new one?
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.720]   That's it.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.200]   That's part of the onboarding now.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.400]   So tell me about the process.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.240]   What is Dig 4 all about?
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.680]   So essentially--
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.280]   one second, let me just log in.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.000]   Get this done.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.280]   You know, and coming back into Dig
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.200]   to give people a little bit of background,
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.800]   I started the company five years ago,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.080]   but really kind of stepped out and let other people
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.000]   run the show for a while.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.520]   And so--
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.080]   I was busy.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.040]   You were doing other stuff.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.440]   I was doing angel investing stuff, and just--
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.960]   I don't think--
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.480]   I don't think--
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.080]   we know that you really weren't part of Dig.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.760]   I mean, I was there a couple days a week,
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.440]   but outside of that, I was busy just working
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.560]   on other projects, helping other entrepreneurs.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.560]   And I sat down with Mark and Driesen a while ago.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.520]   He's one of our board members and investors,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.200]   and talked to him about some of the frustrations I had
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.520]   with not being able to scale Dig.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.560]   And we had problems for years on scaling Dig.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.880]   Like we couldn't roll out any new features.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.800]   Finally, the new Dig, you'll see it's a lot faster
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.280]   because it's all based on Cassandra back-end.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.480]   We got to a point where we could actually develop new features
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.280]   again, so I was like, well, this is great.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.480]   I can actually see some of these features that I've
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.240]   wanted for a long time.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.000]   So that's interesting.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.240]   So you weren't satisfied with where Dig was.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.360]   You just couldn't change it because the technology--
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.680]   We haven't rolled out anything new in the last two years,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.120]   two and a half years, something like that.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.080]   Since the Dig Labs stuff that you did the flash stuff--
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.160]   Since that was cool.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.720]   Dig V3, yeah.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.280]   About two or three months after that is when things started
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.080]   falling over just from the traffic.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080]   Wow.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.720]   Was that-- was it a hockey stick, a traffic?
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.440]   I mean, was there a--
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   I mean, Dig still is 27-ish million people
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.720]   a month coming to the site.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.040]   Unique some month.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.160]   And so it's like to scale that kind of traffic,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.360]   it requires a special type of engineer and back end.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.760]   And we're very right intensive app with all the digs,
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.160]   obviously.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.720]   So finally, we're on a new back end.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.240]   And so when I came in back into the company here
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.760]   a few couple months ago, my whole thing was,
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.080]   let's pair this down to just three to five awesome features
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.200]   that we've been wanting to do for a long time
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.680]   and get the release out there.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.360]   Just do something really simple.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.480]   And so what you're going to see is basically us
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.280]   fixing a lot of the problems.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.120]   So it's super fast.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.080]   When you dig something, your friends and followers
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.360]   actually see it.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.840]   Like, that was a big thing for a long time.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.240]   People will come in, they dig stories,
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.720]   but no one would actually see those digs.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.520]   So the new default view is what's called My News.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.240]   And My News is essentially a way for you
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.840]   to see what you're seeing right here is all stories that
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.080]   have been touched by my friends.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.040]   So this first story here has been dug by my friend Daniel
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.040]   Birka, so it says, "D" Birka right there.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.600]   The story underneath here has two friends that have dug it.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.880]   So you'll see little number two there.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.840]   And as my friends dig stuff, it just appears right here
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.800]   in this feed for them.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.680]   And if they dig it, it goes up to their followers.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.800]   So it's a really efficient way of spreading links,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.120]   link sharing essentially, on the dig platform.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.000]   And then if you look in the upper right hand corner here,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.560]   you'll see this is the hottest news as determined by my friends.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.920]   So--
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.680]   - So that is the biggest, and I think
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.760]   that's why I'm wearing this T-shirt, the most important
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.800]   change you've made.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.960]   Because the thing to me about Dig,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.440]   they've always made a little less useful
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.640]   because it wasn't people I cared about.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.320]   It was everybody.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.440]   It was a universe that that's what determined
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.520]   what their story was dug.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.120]   - Right, exactly.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.040]   - And what I really would like to do is use a Twitter-style
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.200]   situation where I get to choose who I care about
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.600]   and let them curate my news for me.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.040]   That's what's so powerful about Twitter.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.960]   - Right, exactly.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.200]   So this is the model.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.080]   Is that what you're doing now?
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.600]   - Absolutely.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.000]   So you're picking-- so I'll show you, like,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.240]   when you log in for the first time,
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.120]   this is what you're going to see, something just like this,
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.720]   where you'll see a bunch of suggested users to you.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.400]   You're on here.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.240]   There's a little port right there.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.280]   You can follow Leo.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.200]   - I'm following you.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.720]   I'm following Engadget, of course, Huffington Post.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.000]   You know what?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.400]   These are good suggested users.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.080]   Time, Trent Reznor.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.760]   These are some of your friends too, which is cool.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.600]   - Some friends on there.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.120]   - Yeah, Life Hacker, of course.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.440]   The Oatmeal?
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.040]   - The Oatmeal's a hilarious comic.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.880]   You gotta check it out.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.280]   - I'll follow it.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.040]   - It's pretty awesome.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.440]   - Cracked.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.240]   I love Mashable.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.920]   I love.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.240]   - And then you can go on the left-hand side of you.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.640]   You can see all the-- here's all the different categories.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.240]   So if you just want to follow business sources,
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.320]   you can click on Business over here.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.680]   - Oh, okay.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.680]   So you have effectively like Twitter lists too.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.920]   - Yeah, so it'll allow you to filter them
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.640]   and find the source that you want to follow.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.120]   But the cool thing is, as a publisher,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.920]   so like for example with your profile, Leo,
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   I think what we did, let me go to--
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.040]   Oh, we've changed that.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.800]   We now have Vanity URLs too, so your username
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.320]   is dig.com/yourname.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.080]   - Oh, oh.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.160]   - In this case--
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.960]   - Wait a minute.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.680]   Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.040]   And error occurred at 79.7%.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.480]   Luckily this is Aaron's fault.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.240]   - Is that Aaron's fault?
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240]   Aaron, best of--
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.760]   - That's when I went to my site.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.400]   - You know what?
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.240]   - It's probably--
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.080]   - Did we break it?
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.920]   - No, no, it's up.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.760]   I'm on your phone.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.600]   - Okay, there it is, okay.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.440]   - So check out your profile.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.720]   - Oh, look, these are all their shows.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.760]   - Yeah, so on the right hand side,
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.400]   what we're doing now is that publishers
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.520]   for the longest time have said like,
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.760]   we have all this great content,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.480]   but we have to go and manually submit
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.320]   all of these stories, right?
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.080]   So you can link up your RSS feeds
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.280]   for and claim your feeds that you own.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.600]   And so we've linked up here your Google Buzzfeed
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.280]   and your twit.tv feed.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.000]   And so every time a podcast comes out,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.320]   it automatically submits it to Dig with a single Dig.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.480]   - That's awesome.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.320]   - Yeah.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.400]   - So no more submission and it'll go out
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.720]   to all of your followers instantly
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.560]   and then if they dig it,
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.320]   it goes out to their friends and so on.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.320]   So just a lot of stuff that we should have done
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.480]   a couple of years ago.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.680]   - Can you add comments like you could before?
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.640]   When I dig something, it's the same process
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.920]   of digging something, yes?
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.080]   - Right, same process, it's a lot faster.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.240]   I mean, you'll notice when you dig something
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.560]   and just the whole show's up.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.640]   - This is so slick.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.200]   - So will all the dig bookmarks
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.040]   and all the other stuff,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.480]   the widgets all still work the same?
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.840]   - Yes, they're going to once we put over the API,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.960]   which is what we're still,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.160]   that's why we haven't a sunset of V3 yet
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.000]   is we're still working on that.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.920]   - We should tell everybody,
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.640]   you're getting special access right now.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   - This is early, this is Alpha.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.920]   If there's bugs, there's no, there's going to be bugs.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.200]   And now after an hour and a half,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.720]   are they not going to be able to get in here anymore?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.560]   Or is this--
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.800]   - Yeah, just for the hour and a half,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.640]   just because we're trying to keep it--
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.480]   - We're going crazy.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.600]   - Yeah, we still need to test out some stuff,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.040]   but we'll open this up probably about,
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.160]   I'd say another month or so.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.000]   We'll actually go live.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.960]   - What takes so long and stuff like this?
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.120]   Where's the effort?
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.280]   - Well, I mean, the backend is all Cassandra,
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.840]   which is one of those NoSQL solutions, you know?
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.880]   And we've got a few of the--
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.760]   - So it's your database, but it's not MySQL.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.600]   - Right.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.000]   - And it's flat, is it flat file, is it?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.840]   - No, it's not flat file.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's this weird--
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.840]   - You guys might know.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.160]   - You still do queries and all this stuff?
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.960]   - Yeah, it's just a different way of storing data.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.440]   And we have it now in multi-data centers,
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.760]   like we have a East Coast and West Coast
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.600]   that we're serving out of.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.440]   And so there's a lot of--
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.280]   - What you need to do, yeah.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.040]   - There's a lot of really weird little bugs
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.320]   that we're just trying to work out.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.160]   - Right.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.680]   - So it's a complete refactor.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.800]   And we have to port all of our old data over.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.600]   So that's a lot of work as well.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.280]   - So I wish to say when you say you guys,
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.440]   we have some other people in Studio.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.560]   I dragged over here from FooCamp.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.360]   Let me see if I can figure out where their camera is.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.200]   There you go.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.040]   Tim Shea is here.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.840]   He's from nextnewnetworks.com, which is a great,
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.400]   kind of, twit-like network, really, of aggregated.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.480]   How many shows you have?
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.200]   - I think there's like 81 channels now or something.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.160]   - Wow, huge.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.920]   Nextnewnetworks.com.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.240]   And sitting to his left is the Evil Genius
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.440]   from developer of Boing Boing, Dean Putney.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.600]   Hey, Dean.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.440]   Good to see you.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.320]   He's a junior at CMU.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.400]   - Just finished my junior year.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.160]   - Good, rising senior.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.120]   And also was that, where else were you at?
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.200]   - Institute for the Future.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.040]   - Yeah.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   Cool, cool.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.280]   Are you a maker or you're a web guy?
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.120]   - I'm a web guy.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.960]   - Yeah.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.800]   - Do there.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.680]   - So when Kevin says Cassandra and what a pain,
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.920]   you just ring a bell and just sign?
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.600]   I'm familiar with that stuff.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.360]   I did a project at Carnegie Mellon using Mongo.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.880]   So similar stuff.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   - So these are, are these servers or are they,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.920]   they're databases?
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.160]   - Yeah, this is the database system.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.960]   - Oh, we did a thing on Mongo and Floss Weekly.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.880]   That's another NoSQL, NoSQL.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.800]   - There's a few competing projects right now.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.760]   Well, there was even a session of FU on NoSQL.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.600]   - Yeah.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.720]   - It's a hot topic now, for sure.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.560]   - Why?
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.560]   What's wrong with MySQL?
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.200]   - It's not really better things to be with it so much.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.040]   - Yeah.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.880]   - I'm in the chat room.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.720]   I'm good.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.560]   I'm in the chat room.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.400]   I'm in the chat room.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.240]   I'm in the chat room.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.640]   - I think he likes that chair a little too much.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.880]   - You guys talk all nerdy for five minutes
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.680]   and I'll come back and get a regular stuff.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.120]   I'm just, I'm trying to dig stuff right now.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.040]   - Oh, what are you on dig?
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.320]   Are you on dig.com, dig for?
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.160]   - Yes.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.000]   - Dig on it?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   - Dig me, follow.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.120]   - You are O-H-D-O-C-T-A-H.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.960]   - That's right, I'm cool.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.800]   - Okay.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.640]   - I'm alive.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.680]   - So why do they hate, why do they hate my SQL so much?
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.440]   - I think a lot of it has to do with relationships
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.680]   in the database and how you connect different types
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.760]   of data to each other.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.720]   So, I mean, an example here, digs and users.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.560]   So I imagine that it makes it really easy for you
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.520]   to get all the digs for a particular user
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.000]   in the NoSQL database.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.600]   - It's a lot of joins with MySQL
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.240]   and that's really heavy on the database.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.080]   - Yeah.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.080]   - In the NoSQL system, you can just collect it,
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.080]   well, does Cassandra use embedded documents or?
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   - I do not know.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.040]   - Okay, well I imagine it does.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.880]   - There are much people,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.720]   - There's really familiar with it.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.560]   - People smarter than me wearing errands.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.400]   - I'm saying errands.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.240]   - Errands.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.080]   - Errands.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.920]   - It really does know that one.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.760]   (laughing)
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.600]   - And Chris.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.080]   - Yeah, in Mongo, when you get a user,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.440]   all of the digs would come with it basically.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.480]   - So you'd be very easy to access that.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.320]   - Right.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.120]   This was kind of the problem the Twitter had
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.040]   when it was trying to scale.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.680]   - Actually, Twitter engineers are working very closely
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.280]   with dig engineers on this because they also have a cluster
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.400]   of Cassandra servers that they're working on as well.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.760]   - You told me this and I thought this was really cool
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.600]   that there's this collaborative thing going on.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.960]   You said that the Twitter guys will come over to--
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.880]   - And J's come over to our guys and Facebook guys
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   and everybody's talking about,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.680]   well, how do you solve this?
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.520]   How do you do that?
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.360]   How do you scale?
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.600]   - And it's all open source too.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.920]   It's an Apache project.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.480]   - That's so awesome.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.720]   There's, it's interesting that there's this collaboration
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.200]   going on among erstwhile competitors in Silicon Valley.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.960]   Everybody's helping each other out.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.800]   I think that's really cool.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.640]   - It's pretty awesome.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.600]   - Yeah, it's really amazing.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.880]   So let's see more of Dig 4 Kevin Rose showing us
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.920]   for the first time ever.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.520]   If you wanted, if you just joined us
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.520]   and you want to take a look just from now
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.560]   to the end of the show,
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.400]   - 430.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.000]   - beta.dig.com.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.320]   - New, sorry.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.400]   - new.dig.com.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.000]   - And then click on request and invite,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.840]   put in your Dig username and password
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.280]   and we'll let you write in.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.120]   - All right.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.600]   - So yeah, so basically we're also doing things
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.440]   like if you leave a comment,
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.040]   your friends instantly see it.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.800]   So there's no more having to go into a story.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.640]   So--
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.600]   - This could be Twitter, right?
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.120]   - It's basically, the thing about Twitter,
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.840]   the funny thing is that people,
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.440]   I've been asked by the press a couple times,
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.680]   like how does this compare to Twitter?
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.280]   How does it compare to Facebook?
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.680]   And the way that I look at it is that,
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.880]   you know, on Facebook, when you like something,
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.480]   when you click the like button,
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.360]   like it goes into that algorithm that they have
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.640]   and they look at all your different touch points
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.920]   with all the different users that you know
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.120]   and then they determine like,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.600]   does it have enough power to put it
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.800]   at the top of your newsfeed, right?
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.040]   So there's no guarantee that your friends
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.600]   are actually gonna see it.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.520]   Twitter obviously, opposite of that, completely open,
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.280]   extremely easy to follow tastemakers.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.600]   You get a little bit of everything,
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.800]   including the stuff that you don't want.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.080]   So like you can follow Tony Hawk,
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.200]   but you're also gonna get the fact that,
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   you know, Tony Hawk tweets about dropping his kids off
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   at the park when all you really want are--
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.400]   - I want his videos, his links, right?
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   - I want his damn links.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.240]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.680]   In fact, this turning out, that's what's valuable
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.480]   about Twitter, at least for a certain,
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.600]   I guess you're right.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.760]   Sometimes I wanna know what he's doing.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.040]   - Right, exactly.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.640]   - But mostly what I really want is the links.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.440]   So it's just cool 'cause you can map it to your Twitter graph.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.280]   - You can.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.520]   And so this basically just allows you to be a tastemaker
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.360]   and news.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.120]   - It's always been about news and so we're always about the links.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.800]   We just wanna make it as efficient as possible
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.920]   for you to dig and syndicate and spread content
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.240]   to the people you care about.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.600]   So you can go in, you can follow your friends,
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   you can follow the tastemakers,
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.640]   you can follow the sources that you like
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.160]   and then all of that will come directly into your my news.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.000]   - There's got Nate.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.200]   - And everybody wants to compare everything to Twitter.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.040]   I mean, really-- - I know, that's not fair.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.960]   - How is this better than Reddit right now
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.160]   or something like that? - Right.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160]   - A service that's trying to go after your throat.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.040]   Like that's who I care about with the differences.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.760]   - 'Cause that's the most direct--
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.040]   - The Twitter and the Facebook is like a smokescreen
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.080]   of a question 'cause it's really, it's not the same thing.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.560]   - Well it's just very different than Reddit,
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.280]   don't you think, Doctor?
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.040]   - Definitely, especially right now the way this is.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.520]   I really like the way this is set up right now.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.920]   - I think this is gonna be so much more useful.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.000]   - The biggest thing for me is the RSS feed out too
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.520]   'cause I'm one of the guys, you know, I do my own show.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.320]   So I may at least be the first submitting person
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   all the time.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.680]   So I always feel like it's cheating,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.120]   but you gotta do it 'cause it gets the ball rolling
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.160]   and it's just habit.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.440]   But now I don't have to worry about that anymore.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.200]   So that makes me happy.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.960]   Top news from people I follow, new iPhone arrives.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.680]   This drummer's at the wrong gig, the iPhone.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.360]   - Oh that's the funniest video ever.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.200]   - Have you seen that?
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.040]   - Have you seen that?
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.760]   - Right now, see this is gonna be awesome.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.600]   I'm so excited.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.880]   - So now if you dig that story,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.360]   it instantly goes out to all of your followers
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.840]   and look at the top of their my news.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.880]   - Yeah.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.720]   - That's really it.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.040]   - So stuff can go viral so fast.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.520]   - Yeah.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.160]   - That's pretty powerful.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.040]   - You gotta watch that drummer video, it is epic.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.120]   The guy looks like, you've you seen it?
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.360]   - Yeah, oh no, it's fantastic.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.200]   - Yeah.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.880]   - This drummer is at the wrong gig.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.040]   - So into it too.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.880]   - Yeah.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.400]   - I'm gonna take you to where me and the fellas perform.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.640]   - You gotta fast forward to like,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   I'd say 30 the way in.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.920]   - So this is at like some county fair, right?
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.400]   And these guys are just like.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.640]   - A little something to feature our own.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.480]   - Top of the band.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.840]   - This is the top one of the first.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.120]   - Yeah, all of a sudden they realize,
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.400]   they realize how awesome he is
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.240]   and then they just start like zooming in on him
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.480]   once he starts going crazy.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.800]   - It's like too good?
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.480]   - Yeah, he's just way too good.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.440]   I like his.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.440]   - He's like a showman too.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.280]   - Yeah.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.120]   - It's arm work.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.960]   - Hold on.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.200]   No one to fast forward it's tiny bit.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.920]   He's just kind of going chill right now.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.040]   I hear you guys.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.240]   Oh man.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.720]   It's a little choppy.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.560]   You gotta watch.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.280]   - There's a choppy online because you've got
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.280]   the good computer.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.800]   ♪ This girl's crazy about a sharpness man ♪
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.320]   (laughing)
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.720]   - He's like, he's going first Farley.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.600]   - Yeah, much more interesting than the band.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.960]   The camera guy's like, look at that.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.920]   And he keeps rolling the sticks down his leaves
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.160]   and catching him and twirling them and everything.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160]   (laughing)
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.000]   - All right.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.840]   - Did you see the next song after this, they play?
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.680]   - No.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.520]   - The lead singer comes behind and starts grabbing
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.960]   the six with him and drumming with him.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.120]   So they totally know he's like a star.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.960]   - Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.800]   - He can't jump in with him.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.640]   It is awesome.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.840]   - It has like four million views that video.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.680]   - It does.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.080]   - It has four million, four point seven million views.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.040]   And now I'm gonna get, you know, every time I do this,
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.440]   I get a, you can, you can just slide that lens
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.720]   just a little bit to the left.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.080]   I don't know if Kevin moved or the camera moved.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.360]   (imitating camera noises)
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.200]   Nice.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.120]   This is how, this is what a professional operation
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.360]   we have here.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.080]   The guests become the camera operators.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.760]   - I'm on sandwich duty in 25 minutes.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.600]   - What?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.920]   - Oh yeah, you gotta get sandwiches for the gang.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.920]   - I'm on sandwich duty.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.760]   - So this is cool.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.720]   So I would never would have seen that video,
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.720]   but that's not so different from other sources.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.920]   The key is that you're gonna give me stuff
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.760]   that's super relevant now,
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.680]   because I'm following people that I care about
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.120]   and not people I don't care about.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.560]   - That was a problem for us.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.240]   I think that when you look at the Dig front page,
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.080]   you get people like my mom that would come to the site
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.640]   and say like, this site isn't for me.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.480]   - Right.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.320]   - Because it was, you know,
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.840]   a combination of political news,
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.360]   cats jumping off of diving boards,
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.120]   like all this random stuff.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.600]   And in this case, you know, she goes in,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.560]   she follows Oprah, she follows a few of the other accounts
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.480]   that she really cares about.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.600]   And it's custom news for her.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.800]   - This is the future of, in my opinion,
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.520]   this is the future of all of this stuff.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.080]   Is curation by your friends?
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   - And I think that what we're working on next
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.480]   and some of the bigger stuff,
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.480]   I think that this is a lot of the low hanging fruits
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.520]   that we wanna do for a long time.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.480]   The bigger stuff though is how we can figure out
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.600]   user reputation, and so that when you dig stuff,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.520]   you know, you're building a reputation for yourself
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.640]   around different topics.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.480]   - Right.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.040]   - So kind of a core style, you know,
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.600]   when you go and you try to build a reputation
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.400]   around different subjects,
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.080]   we wanna find the same type of users
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.760]   who are the taste makers in, you know, Audi cars,
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.960]   or T, or different topics,
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.160]   and how can we build a reputation around that?
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.080]   So that's gonna be, you know, releases later,
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.880]   but that's kind of the bigger picture stuff
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.240]   that we're working on after we get this launch out.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.680]   - So on people like you dig something like 23,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.240]   people can go write a blog post about it
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.960]   because you found it credible.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.920]   - Well, and how many people dig after you?
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.240]   So if you like dig something and it blows up,
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.480]   then you're, you know, you've just earned a little bit
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.840]   of credit as a taste maker under that particular topic,
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.160]   you know, 'cause you were really one of the first influencers
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.360]   to find that piece of content.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.200]   - Exactly.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.240]   - I always try to do that, and I'm never the first,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.400]   never, I'm a follower, not a leader.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.000]   - It's good to piggyback, Uncle Leo.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.840]   - I do.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.080]   - I'm just hoping you push on my content,
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.000]   then you make me look better.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.520]   - That's right, but that's the neat thing,
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.480]   is it's okay, right?
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.560]   You don't mind if I retweet you, right?
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.800]   - Especially when it's your friend,
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.960]   because I'm gonna follow you,
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.080]   and you find credible-- - Right, we have a social contract.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.760]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.120]   - Kevin Rose is here, Owen Stone is here also joining us,
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.400]   Dean Putney from Carnegie Mellon University's
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.040]   a developer at Boing Boing, and I dragged him here from
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.080]   Food Camp, actually Tim Shae did,
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.800]   he's with the next new networks.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.280]   We're gonna take a little break, come back with more,
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.680]   Kevin Rose has two more big announcements.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.520]   - Oh boy.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.920]   - One you're not anxious to do, I know,
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.680]   and one that you're excited about, but it's a rumor
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.960]   that's kind of a mind-boggling rumor,
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.480]   and that's the-- - You haven't heard it yet.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.000]   - You don't know what I'm talking about it, or do you?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.920]   - I kind of know what you're talking about.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.560]   We'll see, I might, I might know what you're talking about.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.400]   - All right.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.840]   - Does it have to do with the Google?
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.680]   - Maybe.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.400]   - You know what, they were like all these Google people.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.880]   - Did they say it, did you ask them?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.720]   - Did you ask them?
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.560]   - Did you say a bloody thing?
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.640]   Did you even get into me?
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.800]   Well I didn't, 'cause I didn't know about it till I got here.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.720]   So I didn't, did you, did either of you guys know
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.240]   about this new Google thing?
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.480]   No, no, they're looking blank at me.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.960]   - Yeah, we're completely oblivious.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.880]   - Oh good, this is good.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.480]   Yeah, see this is one problem being a food camp,
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.880]   you're completely out of touch.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.280]   (laughing)
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.360]   - You kind of always feel like there's something else
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.040]   going on in the next room that's even better than what I--
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.320]   - Yeah, that's the problem with food.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.160]   Like you're sitting there like,
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.920]   is this the best talk that I should be in right now?
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.920]   - Oh, it's hard, that's tough.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.120]   - That's just stupid all the time.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.520]   - Yeah, they're just as smart as people in the world
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.520]   are there and you're a, I wanted to talk to Tim.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.200]   Every time I went close to Tim, he'd turn away
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.760]   and talk to somebody else, 'cause I think he knew
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.920]   that I was coming, I was going like this.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.480]   It was very intense, 'cause I wanna talk him
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.920]   into letting us broadcast it,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.240]   and I know that's antithetical to what food camp is,
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.080]   but they should.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.680]   - We should start Leo Camp.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.840]   - And just broadcast it.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.680]   Why not?
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.360]   - Just broadcast it, 'cause I think it's cool
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.720]   to get through these great minds together.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.960]   It's uncool to hide the output.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.800]   - Right.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.960]   - Yeah, I mean, just don't do it at the same time,
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.880]   obviously don't compete, but we could do a really fun--
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.800]   - Oh, I wouldn't compete with--
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.120]   - I think camping's a great idea though, camping's awesome.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.160]   - I did a tent, even though I'm half an hour away,
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.000]   I did a tent.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   - Really cool?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.600]   - Yeah, it's really cool.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.840]   Couple of problems.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.920]   First of all, I have a four-man tent,
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.840]   so there's everybody's in one-man tents except me,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.920]   I have like a skyscraper, I have a porch.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.680]   - Of course, Uncle Leo has to have a car.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.080]   - That's the party tent.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.840]   - Dude, you're a massive freaking tent,
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.840]   it was very embarrassing.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.200]   And then second of all, it's next to Scoble,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.800]   who by the way is in a one-man Google tent.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.200]   - And he's gonna be talking all night long.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.000]   - Oh, he didn't go bed to like four or five.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   - And then he talks in his sleeve.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.840]   - And he snores and he talks and it's like, oh God.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.120]   - You need to instantly attempt.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.000]   - So what I did is I just got up at 7.30,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.440]   I made a lot of noise taking my tent down.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.800]   - Did you take a shower there?
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.920]   - Yeah, that was a little strange.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.160]   It's kind of communal, right?
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.040]   I didn't take a shower yesterday,
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.960]   and I really had to take one today.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   (laughs)
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.520]   Fortunately, I have this nice way.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.480]   Dig was my idea, sure.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.920]   Hey, very quickly, I'd love to talk a little bit
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.080]   about our friends at Squarespace.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.080]   I know you know them very well, Kevin Rose,
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.400]   'cause that's your blog.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.400]   And do you know Anthony and Dane?
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.480]   - I do, yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   - Yeah, I figured you would.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.720]   - Anthony is a brilliant guy.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.200]   He's so smart, it's insane.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.320]   I just, well smart guys.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.440]   - I think what they're doing is great.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.840]   Squarespace is the place to,
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.300]   we're exceptional websites begin.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.440]   We're starting to put some of our stuff on there,
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.800]   we've got the inside twit blog there,
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.920]   and I'm gonna move the tech guy blog over to Squarespace,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.840]   because it's just so easy to set up a great-looking site
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.280]   with a couple of clicks of the mouse,
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.840]   and then you've got complete customization control,
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.600]   to the point where you can drag and drop widths of everything.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.680]   I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.240]   You've got great stats.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.000]   The iPhone app is killer.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.320]   It's just got all the features you're looking for.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.720]   It is hosting plus, hosting plus the software.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.160]   And by the way, it's easy to import your WordPress,
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.520]   your blog or your movable type,
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.200]   or your Type Hat blog right in,
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.720]   and they're big believers in round tripping.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.920]   So you're never stuck.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.440]   You can export it right out too,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.880]   if you decide you wanna go somewhere else,
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.800]   you're never stuck.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   Built-in search engine optimization,
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.080]   permission access handling means
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.880]   you can have multiple editors,
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.400]   and it's in the cloud,
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.120]   they're using a virtual server technology
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.960]   that allows them to add,
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.400]   it's kinda, the state of the art allows them
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.960]   to add bandwidth as needed,
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.920]   so your site does not ever go down.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.480]   So if you get dug in the new dig 4G--
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.320]   - You can attest to that.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.400]   I've had my site on--
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.640]   - You get dug all the time.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.720]   - I've had a couple homepage stories
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.880]   and they've been able to handle them, no problem.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.080]   - Yeah.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.900]   - I want you to take a look at it,
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.080]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.160]   If you go there right now,
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.140]   you could try it free for 15 days,
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.000]   and if you'd like 10% off for the life of your new site,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.720]   all you have to do is use the word "twit" at checkout,
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.360]   T-W-I-T, squarespace.com/twit.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.320]   So Kevin, I'm gonna give you some time and space
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.920]   to compose yourself.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.840]   - Yes.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.760]   - And bring us the news.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.040]   What's the news, Kevin Rose?
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.960]   - So I wasn't gonna talk about this actually,
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.720]   and then I realized it's being picked up
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   on a bunch of different blogs.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.920]   - It's being leaked out there.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.400]   - So it's like, it's too late to keep it,
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.680]   'cause I got a request to take down the tweet
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.960]   that I tweeted about it,
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.840]   and I took down the tweet, and now--
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.680]   - So you tweeted it?
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.040]   - I tweeted it last night,
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:55.880]   I had a couple of glasses of wine.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.000]   - So first of all, let's say this,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.920]   you had a great party last night,
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.400]   which I couldn't come to.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.240]   - Friday night. - Friday night.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.080]   - Friday night. - Yes.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.880]   - It's three's fifth year anniversary.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.240]   - Five years, crazy.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.080]   - Isn't that great?
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.920]   - It's not. - Yeah.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.920]   - Congratulations on that.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.320]   - I'm bummed you couldn't make it.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.080]   - There was comedy, there was magic.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:11.960]   - Shwood was there right now.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.800]   - There's drama.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.960]   - Yeah, great, a great band.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.200]   My daughter's girlfriend, my boyfriend's band or something.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.360]   - They did a killer, they did a killer,
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.240]   Michael Jackson cover, like their third set,
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.080]   and it was awesome.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.920]   - Who, the Dizzy balloons?
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.760]   - Yeah.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.600]   - Did you like them?
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.440]   - Yeah, they were like,
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.760]   'cause it was the anniversary of Michael Jackson's death,
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.800]   and he did a Michael Jackson song,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.560]   and they covered it, and it was their awesome band.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.640]   - I thought they were really good.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.240]   I asked her if she's, if they're signed.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.560]   She said, "Well, they're on iTunes."
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.120]   - That's what signed is now.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.200]   - Her generation, no idea what that means.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.240]   Yeah, they're on iTunes, what do you want?
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.840]   They have a record, yeah.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.280]   - Hey, they're making money.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.840]   - They're signed, I don't know what that means.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.680]   - Someone's talking about their money.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.520]   - Yeah, by the album.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.520]   - So, it went well, you had a special dignity with Alex,
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.600]   and you did a lot of great things,
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.440]   and then you got drunk and tweeted.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.960]   - No, that was actually the last night
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.680]   that I had wine and tweeted.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.520]   - 'Cause you were sad.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.480]   - So the day after that.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.480]   - Yeah, but so essentially what happened is,
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.840]   you know, I got leaked a rumor
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.600]   from a pretty credible source, I believe.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.960]   - Oh, you're gonna talk about the other thing.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.480]   - Oh, you wanna talk about the other thing.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.320]   - Yeah.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.160]   - Which one do you wanna start?
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.000]   You wanna start the Google one?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.840]   - Do the Google thing.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.680]   - You wanna do the Google one?
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.520]   - Yeah, okay, so essentially--
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.960]   - Do you have to take that tweet down?
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.800]   - Yeah, I have to take the tweet down.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.640]   - Who?
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.480]   - Who?
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.880]   - Who called you?
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.280]   - Let's just say--
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.760]   - Eric Schmidt says hello, Eric Kevin.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.680]   - Do we have, you have been tweeting again?
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.080]   - We follow your Twitter accounts.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.480]   - So yeah, basically the rumor was that Google
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.520]   is launching a Facebook competitor soon.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.720]   - Yes, I'm so happy.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.880]   - And then it's gonna be called--
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.720]   - It's not our quit.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.960]   - It's gonna be called Google Me.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.800]   - Google Me.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.640]   - And I've heard it's a good name.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.960]   - It's pretty awesome.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.320]   - Really is what the rumor is
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.240]   and this is a very credible source, so.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.720]   We'll see, Facebook competitor.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.760]   - Mm, Dean's going, hm, sound surprised.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.480]   - Well, it sounds interesting.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.320]   - Sounds great.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.840]   - It's actually after the buzz thing
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.320]   with trying to take over Twitter.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.000]   - Well, and there's an opportunity here
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.760]   because I think there's, I'm not the only one
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.760]   who's a little bit skittish and fed up about Facebook,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.760]   but I do trust Google.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   - Well, Google had its own little privacy problem too
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.760]   with their buzz, so I mean, come on.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.760]   - Yeah, the problem I have with Google though
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.400]   is the usability thing.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.760]   Like, they're products, outside of Gmail,
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.760]   I can't point to really one product where I'm just like,
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.760]   "Wow, this is a killer user experience."
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   - I thought I'd go to Orkut, right?
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   - I think that was their Facebook.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.760]   - Right.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   - It's not usable.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.760]   - It's terrible.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.760]   - It has no feeling behind it whatsoever.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.760]   Everything is like-
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.760]   - It's like Google.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760]   - Made for a machine.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.760]   - I am on Orkut, and so are my friends.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   - I'm so often cuddly.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.760]   - Please.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   - Tell me, how are you?
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   What are you up to today?
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.760]   You can make me different colors.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.760]   - And however, here's why Google does not scare me on.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   Their business model is an alignment with my interests
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   as opposed to Facebook.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.760]   So Facebook's business, in my opinion, Facebook's business model
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   is all about the more they can reveal about me,
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   the more the better, right?
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.760]   Google's business model is the more you use the web,
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   the more we make.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   So in my opinion, Google's model is speed up the web,
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.760]   make the web more usable, make the web better,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.760]   make it friendly or give us great tools, give us YouTube,
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.760]   all this stuff, because the more we use it,
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.760]   the more they make, right?
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   - I respect that answer.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   - Does that make sense?
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.760]   - Yes.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.760]   - Facebook, that's not Facebook's deal is make everything Facebook.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.760]   The like button is about drawing you into Facebook.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.760]   It's not about promoting the web, it's about drawing you into Facebook.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   - So in 10 years, you're gonna be the first person lined up
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.760]   to get Google socks and Google deodorant,
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.760]   'cause they're gonna take over.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.760]   - Well, if they take over the world, then we'll talk.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.760]   - Okay.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760]   - I'm not saying I love them forever.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.760]   - Okay.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   - I'm not marrying them.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   - They're just slowly infiltrating every orifice of your life on the web.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.760]   - Well, I'd like to see some competition, but I think that one of the reasons
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.760]   you can't leave Facebook right now, one of the reasons it was painful
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.760]   for me to leave Facebook is because I'm disconnecting
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.760]   and there's nowhere else I can send it, right?
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   - Yeah, well, that's what happened.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.760]   Well, you had my space and then Facebook came and you could leave my space.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.760]   - You could leave my space.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.760]   - Right?
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.760]   - So there's nowhere for us to leave to, so you have a very valid point there.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.760]   - So again, it has to look good, it has to feel good for me to use it.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.760]   - Yes, I am.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.760]   - For the regular person to use it, I don't care that Google did it.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.760]   You know, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.760]   I mean, we're in here, we're in, I'm not a nerd.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   You got to smarter than me.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.760]   But, you know, for you guys, maybe you'll try, but for the masses,
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.760]   Google has to finally break down and say, "I need a supermodel.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   I need somebody that looks good and feels good, and I want to take home to my mom
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.760]   and impress everybody."
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   - Can they do that, Kevin?
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.760]   - It's hard for people to make the jump at this point because, I mean,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.760]   the news feed is very addicting.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.760]   I mean, you go there every day to see what your friends are up to,
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.760]   all your friends are already there, your family's there.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   I mean, I have aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.760]   - That's not hard for me.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   - How am I going to get my aunt to change to Google me, you know?
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.760]   It's like she's not going to, you know?
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   - Give yourself a little bit more power than that, Mr. I tweet stuff.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.760]   - No, look, here's the deal.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.760]   Do I want to call my aunt up and teach her how to make the change?
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.760]   And the answer is no.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.760]   - Especially if it was to take time.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.760]   - Especially if Google doesn't make it appealing.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   - Right.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.760]   - Because then it's even harder, it's even more hard to help for you.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.760]   - Right.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.760]   I'm not going to use it unless it's--
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760]   - What does Google have to do to make Google me compete with Facebook?
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.760]   - It doesn't have to be, I'm not saying beat Facebook.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   I'm saying be competitive.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   - In my mind, it's going to have to be like a being-like experience in that.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.760]   It has to be beautiful.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   It has to have some features and functionality that are above and beyond what Facebook can
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   do.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.760]   It can't just be a clone.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.760]   I think that so many clones fail just because they're copying feature for feature.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.760]   There's been thousands of dig clones over the years.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   The ones that scare me, the most are the ones that aren't copying us, but actually innovating
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   in different ways.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   - Reddit doesn't scare you as much as somebody who's doing something different.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   - Right, exactly.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   Like a different take on what you're doing.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.760]   - I'm curious to see what it is, but it's sad they lost their--
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.760]   - Who was a Doug Bowman that was their main creative director for a long time.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.760]   - He went to Facebook.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.760]   - He went to Twitter.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.760]   - I'm sorry, Twitter.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.760]   - Yeah, and so he is brilliant.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.760]   That guy was one of the best designers, and he just got fed up because he said they wanted
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.760]   to test 54 shades of blue with an algorithm.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.760]   - You wrote an algorithm.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.760]   - A very famous blog post about why design sucks at Google.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.760]   - Right, and so I just don't have the faith.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   - Google Wave, what?
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.760]   Amazing.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.760]   - Yeah.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.760]   - Google Buzz, what?
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   - I like Buzz.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.760]   You don't like Buzz, I like Buzz.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.760]   I'm still--
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.760]   - You were laying there.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.760]   - You were there like Scoble and Six of them as well.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.760]   - There's a lot of work.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.760]   - There's only a few of you.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.760]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.760]   You need something for regular people, and Google just doesn't get that.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   They have the smartest people.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.760]   If you go to a Google office, you'll be amazed at the creativity and the beauty
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.760]   of the beauty of everything that they do and the colors and the toys.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.760]   - Beauty Fiacity.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.760]   - Yeah, my gosh.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.360]   - But if you go look at their products, it's like, look dude, like a three-year-old
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.760]   coder could have made something that looked better than this.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   - You have a three-year-old too.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   You should get her to do the designs.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.760]   - Google hired me and my daughter.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   We would make everything beautiful asity and hire me.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.760]   I'll do that.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.760]   I'll sit in this chair and make stuff look good like I do for myself.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   - Well, I could say right now, I mean, I really did disconnect myself from my family.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.760]   And not my close friends.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.760]   My close friends, of course, are my friends.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   I talk to them.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760]   I have a relationship with them.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.760]   It's the second chair.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   It's like my first girlfriend in high school.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.760]   There's no way she can poke me anymore, right?
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   - Right.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   - Which is not so bad.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.760]   But Kathy, I love you, but stop poking me.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   But it's those second-tier friends that you wouldn't have been in touch with without Facebook.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.760]   And Facebook gives you a way to loosely engage with them.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.760]   You don't have to email them or call them.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.760]   You just kind of know what they're doing.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   You see their pictures and stuff.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.760]   - See the random birthdays, things like that.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   - And so you feel like you're connected.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.760]   And that was the only pain of withdrawing from Facebook for me.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.760]   It wasn't a business issue because we have a lot of presence on the web.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   We don't need Facebook for that.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.760]   - Yeah.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   Did your family, do you still have a fan page though?
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.760]   Do you have a Twitter page?
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   - No, I killed them all.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.760]   - Because they're well, it was tied to my account.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   So if I kill my account, it's all gone.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   It's all gone.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760]   That's okay.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.760]   I don't think that for my business, I don't think our audience, it's like being on AOL.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.760]   I don't think they want us.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   I don't think they care.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   - The only thing I have, I mean, did you consider just stop using them?
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   Like, lead them be, but don't use them because that way in case they ever correct their ways down the road.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:05.760]   - I had this conversation and I apologize to those who've heard this before, but I had this conversation with myself.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.760]   Can I just stay here?
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.760]   I know how to use Facebook.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   Can I just stay here?
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.760]   I know how to be private on Facebook.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.760]   They're not invading my ability.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.760]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.760]   But by being there, it's coercing other people, including family and friends to be part of Facebook.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   I'm part of the problem if I'm on it.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   - Are you kids still?
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   - Yeah.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   - They're still on it.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   That was when it really hit me.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.760]   It's like I tried to explain to them why it's dangerous.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   I said, "Don't put anything on Facebook that you wouldn't put that you don't want family, friends, future employers to see."
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.760]   - Teacher employers is the big one.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   - Yeah.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   - And they didn't get that.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   They said, "No, it's private."
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   And they said, "Nah, yeah, well."
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.760]   - And that's the thing about the internet.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.760]   Once you step foot on the internet, privacy is not the problem or the issue.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.760]   It's about control because anything you put on there you know to somebody has access to.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.760]   We talked about this earlier.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.760]   Using better tools for the code.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   - It's all about control.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.760]   - Yes.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   - Someone can get a hold of your information at any moment.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.760]   As soon as you go on the internet, you're putting yourself out there to be exposed.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.760]   So watch what you do.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.760]   Your brother told you that when you were two years old.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   - Right.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.760]   - Wear clean underwear in case you get hit by a bus.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.760]   - It's pretty straightforward, isn't it?
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.760]   - Yes, but we don't do that.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   - Kids don't get it.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.760]   - And they don't.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.760]   They get a cell phone and they're taking pictures of themselves at parties drunk and then leave it up there.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   And then somebody searches it on Google me 20 years later and it's still pop straight up.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760]   - Do you're still in college, Dean?
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.760]   - Everybody's in Facebook.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.760]   - Uh, yeah.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   - CMU.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.760]   I mean, these are a bunch of geeks.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.760]   - Yep.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.760]   - Still on Facebook.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.760]   - Yeah, unfortunately.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.760]   - There's no, is there any backlash at all?
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   - Well, there are a lot of people who are unhappy about things.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.760]   - But they don't leave.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   - Well, where do you go?
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.760]   - You know why?
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.760]   Because Facebook's how you score, isn't it?
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.760]   It's how you meet girls.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.760]   I think really seriously.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.760]   - It is, it is, really like--
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   - That's the real point of Facebook for college age kids anyway.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.760]   - There have been so many situations where all you need is my name anymore.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.760]   - Right.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:49.760]   - You don't, I mean, it's literally my address book on the internet and that's fantastic.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.760]   I mean, you meet somebody at a party, you catch half a name.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.760]   - So I'm on Facebook.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.760]   - Yeah, or they, you know, even like, you know, you see a cute girl and you don't really--
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   - Gocker later.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   - Yeah, but you know her friends or something.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   - Either way, this is exactly why Mark Zuckerberg designed Facebook.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   You know that, your friends with Mark, that's exactly what point was.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.760]   - Well, it started out to meet girls.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.760]   - Yeah, it was a big college thing.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.760]   - How to fall, or how girls can meet guys?
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   What's wrong, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.760]   If Google did a credible alternative, you wouldn't go there because they wouldn't all be there.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.760]   It's gotta be where everybody is, right?
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.760]   - There's a tipping point that has to happen, right?
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   - Right.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   - And that's gonna be pretty difficult.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.760]   - Yeah.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.760]   - And if they make something that looks good, people will try it.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.760]   And that's the biggest thing, like, Google Buzz, I couldn't get away from it the first week.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.760]   After a week, it just died out.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.760]   - So--
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.760]   - Yeah.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.760]   Dan Shapiro is here.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.760]   He said, "Here's his claim to fame.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.760]   I beat him at werewolf."
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.760]   (laughs)
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   - Let's squeeze Dan in somewhere.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   Oh, and can you share that chair?
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.760]   - I can share that chair by now.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.760]   - Share the chair, baby.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.760]   - I have my chair.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.760]   - Hey, Dan, have a seat.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.760]   Do you know Kevin Rose, Dan?
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.760]   - Hey, how's it going?
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:58.760]   - Kevin Rose, Dan, the serial entrepreneur, also a four.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.760]   We're gonna make Owen leave.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.760]   We're gonna continue on.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.760]   Actually, while we're doing that, go ahead and get in there.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.760]   I want Kevin as one more announcement to make.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.760]   One more announcement from Kevin, and we're gonna do that in a second, but first.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.760]   (laughs)
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.760]   But first...
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.760]   - You got the chair.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.760]   - Owen's not gone.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.760]   He's just...
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.760]   If you have anything to say, come stand behind me and say it.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.760]   Literally, just come on over.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.760]   Just listen and come in here, and he'll be in the chat room too.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.760]   I want to mention, "I stock photo."
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.760]   Great place.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.760]   If you're a blogger, you do content of any kind and you need images.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   Look at a blog post with text.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.760]   It's not as good as a blog post with a picture.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   It's just simple.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.760]   It's just simple.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   But sometimes you don't have that right picture, or don't steal the picture.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:48.760]   You can go to istockphoto.com/
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.760]   Is it Twitstock?
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.760]   I think it is.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.760]   That's strange.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.760]   /twitstock

[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.760]   I'm not sure how you'd use that.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   I'm going to tweet and have stock images in my tweet.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   Here's the chick I met last night.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760]   She's beautiful.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.760]   I don't know what I'd use that for.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.760]   istockphoto.com/twitstock.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:19.760]   I did tweet a few images from a food camp, including the Death Star made out of a watermelon.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   That was truly awesome.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.760]   Wasn't that amazing?
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   Anybody's doing an ignited food camp or otherwise.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   There's no better way to fill out your slide deck than istockphoto.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.760]   Oh, you know about it.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.760]   Oh, use it all the time.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.760]   Oh, for Dex, I didn't even think of that.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.760]   You bet.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.760]   Fantastic.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.760]   You bet.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.760]   Dan, give me a lower third.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.760]   You want danshiphero.com or?
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   Danshiphero.com.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760]   That's easy.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   Easy to remember.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.760]   You missed our conversation on dig 4, but I'm very excited about that.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.760]   You missed our conversation.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   Maybe you have something to say before we move on to the next story about Kevin's scoop.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   You say you have it on good authority.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.760]   Someone that is very closely connected to the project, yes.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.760]   So whether it'll see the light of day, I don't know when.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.760]   You know how we know it's real?
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.760]   Because they made you take it down.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   I took it down.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.760]   If it were fake, that tweet would still be up there and you know that.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.760]   They made you take it down.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.760]   So he says it's a Facebook, Dan.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   It's a Facebook clone from Google called Google me, a Facebook competitor.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.760]   Oh, I haven't heard this.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.760]   Is that a story?
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.760]   Is that juicy?
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.760]   It's got to be a bit of them buzz.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   Man.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   Hopefully.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.760]   Well, that's the trick, isn't it?
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.760]   Why does everybody mention buzz?
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.760]   When Google says we're going to do something new, first it was wave and now it's buzz.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.760]   It sounds like they're getting any credit for Android.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.760]   You know, I'm looking at Android.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.760]   You know, one of the things we were talking a lot about I think at Food this weekend was
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.760]   that, you know, this idea of, you know, can things anticipate better your needs?
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.760]   You know, some of the guys were there from Doppler.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   That's now part of Nokia and we were talking about, you know, how well Doppler did some of that.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.760]   Doppler's Nokia now?
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   I believe so, right?
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.760]   When they first find out the market bought that.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.760]   I had bought that.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   Wow.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.760]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.760]   I think it's a good thing.

[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.760]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.760]   That kind of bugged me a little bit.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   I also got my 3GS to do it as well.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   That's the point is all cell phone case.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   Let's talk about this real quickly.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:33.760]   It turns out that if you look at the iPhone, it has, first of all, kind of crazy to build
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   a device that you drop frequently and have it have glass on both sides.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   Now I don't think glass on the front glass in the back.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   They say it's gorilla glass.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.760]   It's stronger than plastic BS.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.760]   I fixed it, dropped it and it shattered.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.760]   Of course.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.760]   It's glass.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   Sorry, dudes.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   It's beautiful though.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   It's beautiful industrial design glass on both sides.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:51:01.760]   Then a unibody aluminum cast aluminum stripe all the way around it.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   The left hand side is, I think the left hand side is a 3G antenna.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.760]   The right hand side is the Wi-Fi antenna.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.760]   There's a reason for these bars.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:16.760]   At the bottom, there are two black plastic insulators that insulate those antennas from
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.760]   the U-shaped piece at the bottom.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.760]   That's the cell phone antenna.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   If you cup the iPhone, it's very easy to demonstrate this.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   I'll show you Kevin right now.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.760]   I've got five bars on my iPhone.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:31.760]   All I have to do is cup it in the left hand and I'm a lefty.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   That's exactly how I would hold it.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.760]   But do you actually hold it like that when you talk on the phone?
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   Do you hold it that tight?
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.760]   Well, maybe not.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.760]   I don't know.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.760]   If you look at the ads, of course somebody sent an email to Steve Jobs saying, "Dude."
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   And Steve's response one line.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.760]   It's totally useless.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   Well, don't do it.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.760]   So, did you see that?
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.760]   It went from five bars to zero bars.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.760]   Just that fast.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.760]   So, it does.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   It's absolutely true.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   But you're right.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   You can do it with a Palm Pre.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.760]   You can do it with a 3.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   And so, I'll see if I can find this article.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   An RF engineer wrote a story.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.760]   Did you read the story, Tim?
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.760]   Either of you?
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   Yeah, I did see that.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.760]   He wrote a story saying, "Look, I've designed cell towers for AT&T.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.760]   I know a little bit about RF.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   Here's the deal."
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   He said, "All cell phones have to have an antenna.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.760]   They're radios.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.760]   Used to be you'd have the antenna.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.760]   You'd pull it up."
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   Remember that?
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.760]   Motorola realized nobody was pulling up the antenna on their start tech.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   So, they built an internal body antenna.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.760]   If you pull it up, it'd use the external.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   But if you didn't, at least it would have something that would have the body antenna.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.880]   And I remember holding those antennas and, yes, you would absolutely attenuate the signal
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.880]   just like you do with this.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.760]   So, he said, "All cell phones have the antenna in the body."
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.760]   Here's another thing he said.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:46.520]   When the FCC tests a cell phone, they're not required to test it with a hand, just with
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.520]   a head.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.680]   So, they test the cell phones.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   I've seen this.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.840]   We went to, remember with screen savers?
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:56.360]   We went to the FCC's testing lab, and they have a clamp with a robot on it, and they have
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.360]   the phone.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.400]   And this clamp, there's no hand, clamped to a robot head that's filled with goo that
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.240]   simulates human body goo.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:10.560]   And then they fire, they put a receptor in the goo, and they see where the RF characteristics
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.560]   are.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:15.280]   He said, "Since they don't test with a hand, and all the manufacturers know this, where
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.240]   do they put the antenna, where your hand would be?"
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.080]   Because it's not being tested there.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.880]   And so he said, "This is going to be a universal problem.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.720]   Every phone has somewhere you can hold it and attenuate it.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   However."
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.200]   Still bad news, right?
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.680]   Yeah, it looks bad.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.880]   In fact, that all these videos are leaking out there, and then it's very easy, like you
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.680]   said, to do a better problem.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   Anybody could do this.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.080]   I've got an experiment for a listener to try.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.960]   You know, those cheap little antenna boosting modules that they used to self-world.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   Right.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.960]   They go in the back.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.680]   So I worked at a startup that built a cell phone, and I talked to the RF engineer, and I said,
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.680]   "So these are hokum," right?
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.480]   And he said, "No, no, no."
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.840]   They go through a lot of effort to go optimize the radiation, all different directions for
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:56.840]   these cell phones.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.960]   And when you put one of those stickers on, you're hitting the random number generator.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.200]   May get something better.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.520]   May get something worse.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.520]   So I put it out there.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.720]   I want somebody to grab a couple of these stickers, these cheap ones that you can find,
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.560]   and they give away for free.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.200]   Take them all over the iPhone 4.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   Let's hear what happens.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.000]   See where the best place to put a sticker is.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Exactly.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.680]   That's the part of the problem, is you don't even want to put a case on this.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.600]   I think the conformation that Apple knew about this is that Apple does for the first
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.880]   time sell a case for the iPhone.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.880]   Guess what it is?
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.520]   It's a piece of rubber that goes around the antenna.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.520]   It's right where you would hold it.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.520]   That's the case.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.440]   It's called their bumper case.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:33.840]   Well, apparently that pretty much eliminates the issue.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.840]   It fixes it.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   Yeah, it eliminates the antenna issue.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.840]   So...
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   Yeah, it's a bit different from it.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.440]   Would it be cheaper to just give those away for free than do a recall?
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.360]   They're not going to do a recall, right?
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   So is it the fact that the metal isn't coated with anything?
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:51.440]   I mean, if they put a slight thin plastic coating on the outside, could they not...
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.440]   Maybe, yeah.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.440]   ...have this problem.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.440]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.440]   Or paint it.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.440]   Or tape it.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.440]   I'm not sure.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.440]   Some people say it's because we're shorting the top antenna of the bottom one.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.440]   Right, that's the most idea.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.440]   I'm not sure if it's that or just we're blocking it, but I'm sure you could fix it.
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.640]   What if you put a paperclip between those two in touch?
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.640]   Should I try?
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   Yes, try.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   Let's hack this thing.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.680]   That's the dark tipper I know of.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:19.400]   So it wouldn't be such a problem except that AT&T has such a crappy reputation for dropped
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   calls already.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   Right.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.360]   And this is just going to play right into what people think about the iPhone.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.360]   Do you want to try it?
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.360]   Yeah, let's see if we can...
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.440]   I don't know.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   If you got...
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.040]   I have this clip to try.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.840]   Penny would be better because it's copper, right?
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.840]   Just a damp finger, probably.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.840]   Well, we know.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.840]   Yeah, but we want to test it with like...
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.320]   Does anybody have a penny on them?
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.200]   No, nobody has a penny or a gold chain.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.560]   What's a penny?
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.560]   Uh...
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.640]   Wait, do I want to go on record?
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.600]   Is handing you my wedding ring for a science experiment?
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.600]   There you go.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   I'm going to use my wedding ring.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.600]   Gold is the best.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.600]   Gold is the best.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.600]   Gold is the best.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:58.600]   What if they just didn't charge $30 for the bumper?
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.600]   What if they just didn't charge $30 for the bumper?
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   I think they gave it away.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.600]   And not even give it away.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.600]   Just charge a reasonable price.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.240]   It's the thinnest case you can get.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:08.080]   And it still costs as much as the most expensive case you can get.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.520]   I mean, really, fixed a problem.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.000]   Solved $10 for the thinnest piece of rubber available.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.800]   I mean, Apple is the best at saying, "Look, this is pretty.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.600]   You're going to pay for it no matter what, idiot.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.600]   Just make it cheaper.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.680]   If you know I fixed a problem, I'll pay $10 or $5.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.520]   $30 for a rubber strip and I drop it in a glasto.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.520]   Brakes are crazy."
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.520]   I still don't want that.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.520]   Oh, doctor is a doctor.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.760]   This is what I love Owen for.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.760]   Yeah, totally.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.760]   He just comes in, gets pissed off and walks out.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.960]   So Owen, you can use the room mic too.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.920]   Any time you want it, just come in.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.200]   So yeah, I got it down two bars with the gold ring.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.200]   With the ring.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.200]   Not with your finger, just a ring.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.840]   So take a shorting it then.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.840]   Shooting and shorting a little bit.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.840]   That's what it is.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.840]   It does take a while.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.840]   It takes about a minute or two.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.840]   It's down to a couple bars there.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.480]   That's only because it has to go and say, "Are you there?
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   Are you there?"
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.480]   It's talking to the tower.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   Right.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.480]   And you said I'm in to figure out that, nope, not there.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.480]   There's no tower.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.480]   Yep.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.120]   We couldn't demonstrate this at food camp because we didn't have any signal anyway on AT&T.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.480]   That's part of the fun of food.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.480]   It's interesting.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.800]   You know, one of the things that surprised me and somebody was telling me, "You've been
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.640]   a previous food's Kevin."
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.200]   That was pretty typical at these events for everybody to have a laptop out as they're
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.200]   listening to the event.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   Is that the case?
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.960]   I mean, people have no laptops.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   Really?
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   No laptops.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.960]   Why is that?
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   Barely even phones.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.600]   There were a couple I've had some, but it was like really, everybody's was talking.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.160]   I've never been in a conference.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.200]   And it wasn't like everybody colluded.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.160]   Just nobody brought out a laptop.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.680]   I didn't even bring one.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   That's awesome.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.680]   I don't know what that heralds, if anything.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:44.680]   Well, there are also a couple of talks about, they're all about like turning off technology
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.480]   and getting, there was one about like slow technology.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.840]   There's one called slow technology.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.600]   There's another one about, you know, the new affluence being having leisure time and,
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   you know, all kinds of, there's like a real impulse among.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.520]   And I think it was from a lot of the people that have been there a lot.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.520]   Right.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:04.640]   Well, worthy, they were all just, you know, they're all looking for a way to sort of disengage
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.080]   from all the glut of information.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:10.760]   If anything, the people at an event like this, we're talking about Bill O'Reilly.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:11.760]   Tim O'Reilly.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.320]   I don't want to go to the Bill O'Reilly food camp.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.160]   Bill O'Reilly, who, Tim O'Reilly, I didn't sleep.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:21.120]   I literally did not sleep for three days.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.120]   So you'll excuse me.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.960]   Tim O'Reilly, who is a publisher at O'Reilly Media.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.960]   And you know, for years published all these great computer books with the animals on the
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   idea cover.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.320]   And they do a number of big, big conferences.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.760]   Started it about eight years ago, I think, to have these, he called them Friends of O'Reilly
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.760]   camp.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:41.720]   We're bringing about 200, 250 of, you know, not friends, friends of his necessarily, but
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:46.280]   really interesting thinkers together in a variety of disciplines in a kind of semi-private
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   environment.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.280]   They all camp.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:51.920]   And it was the first unconference, I think.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.200]   So it was the first conference without planned agenda, without keynotes, without speeches.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:01.840]   But everybody who goes was kind of expected to participate either by engaging in an event
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.800]   or by putting one on.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.440]   And you know, there's people with vandigraph generators.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.760]   We toasted a marshmallow last night with a vandigraph generator.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.760]   Tesla coil.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.000]   Oh, that was a Tesla coil.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   Okay, never mind.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   More fun.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   It was loud.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   It was like the state of marshmallow, man.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.560]   I thought it was going to explode.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.040]   It was beautiful.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.600]   It also smelled odd.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:21.600]   Ozone.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.920]   Yeah, it was pretty ozone-y.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:29.160]   It was amazing. I learned something that I was not expecting to be educated in this category.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:33.640]   But one of the talks I went to was Linda Stone, a researcher, used to be with Microsoft
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:37.880]   Research, and she was doing a study on email apnea.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:38.880]   So I have mild sleep apnea.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.120]   And my doctor scared the tarnation out of me when he showed me some of the numbers.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.360]   You stop breathing, right?
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:44.360]   Sleep apnea is where you stop breathing.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.360]   I have a mild case.
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:49.400]   Severe cases shorten the lifespan by five to 10 years or more.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.400]   That's not good.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.400]   It's tremendous.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.400]   So you stop breathing and you don't breathe, you don't breathe in.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.400]   But suddenly with a gasp, you start breathing again.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.400]   Is that basically it?
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   Exactly.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.400]   Okay.
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.560]   And she discovered that people have the same behavior while they're checking their email.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.560]   That people will actually--
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.560]   Hold their breath.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:08.400]   So stop their breathing and hold their breath while they're doing important emails.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.560]   And he was finding stress levels going up, cortisol and so on and so forth.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.520]   And this is amazing and terrifying at the same time.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.480]   So I guess she bugs it, Linda Stone.net, and found some tools that you can actually put
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.800]   a little clip on your ear and have a little glowing orb in the corner of your screen.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.840]   And when your blood oxygen level or whatever it is starts to drop, it turns red.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.080]   It will remind you to take a breath.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080]   That's pathetic.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   We actually need to be told to breathe.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.280]   She was talking about practicing breathing.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.360]   And I'm thinking I've been practicing breathing for 34 years.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.520]   And if you weren't breathing, I guess you know it.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.280]   This is the reason these things need to be taped and put online.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.280]   I would love to watch that.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.720]   Well, and that's my contention is it's great to do this kind of in private because I guess
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.320]   people feel free to talk.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.680]   But this is like Ted.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.800]   I mean, these are many of them spoke at Ted.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.800]   This is like an amazing event.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.200]   And it's a shame.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.920]   I celebrate the fact that Ted decided to put everything online.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   And that's a huge boon.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.320]   And I think Riley should probably do the same thing.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.240]   Here's a picture of the Tesla coil making us more.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.360]   And that was taken with the iPhone.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:19.320]   And I have to say the camera on the new iPhone 4 is unbelievable.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.440]   It is as good as a 5 megapixel white and shoot.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.600]   Are you happy with the video?
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600]   It's the next one.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.440]   And the next one is very good.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.440]   I'm not not good at it.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.440]   Hardware is great.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.440]   The software is terrible.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.080]   It takes tremendous video, but it usually misexposes the still photos.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.040]   So I come out of most my most recent company was on tele then photo bucket.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.600]   So you know a little bit about this.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.040]   Way too much with camera phones.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.120]   But I thought the next one was pretty pretty good.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.560]   But now the iPhone 4 is dramatically good.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.280]   I mean, it really is spectacular.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280]   That's going to change things.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.480]   In fact, I think it's going to put some pressure on Cisco.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   They flip camera.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.480]   Who'd buy a flip camera?
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.480]   Right?
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.840]   Well, maybe somebody doesn't have an iPhone, I guess.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.520]   But this is as good as a flip easily in the video.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.360]   And shooting that Tesla coil in low light at night.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.720]   It's spectacular.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   Here's something Google brought.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.720]   They call it not quite the holodeck.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.160]   That was fantastic.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.160]   What is that?
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.920]   It's like Google Earth on a screen.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.680]   It was just Google Earth on eight screens, but just the immersive experience of having
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680]   it around you.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.160]   And a really brilliant controller.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160]   Yeah, great controller.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.280]   You can just tilt and pan and move around.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.160]   And we actually-- we did some fun stuff with it.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.600]   You can fly around the moon.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.160]   You can go around with the moon landing is.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.440]   And you can actually-- if you get good at the controller, you can sit yourself down
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.200]   right on the rover and look around and sort of see the horizon as they saw it.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.160]   There's another really cool area.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.760]   I forget what it's called.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.160]   The canyon that's right off of LA, off the LA coastline, the underwater canyon is
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160]   deep in the front of the canyon.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.160]   Mariana's trench.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.160]   Mariana's trench.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.600]   You can actually go under the water and sort of fly through the Mariana's trench, which
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.600]   is something no one's ever seen before.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.400]   And so it's like this god-like power to fly around and zoom.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.920]   And then when you're over the Earth, you see all the buildings because people have
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.240]   actually gone and built the buildings in Google Earth, uploaded them, put them in the
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.240]   proper motions.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.320]   Yeah, they've wrapped the photos around the buildings, too.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.400]   So we were going through Western New York.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.880]   I was flying to my apartment to look in my window.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.120]   And there were some that are so lifelike wrapped.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.560]   I saw a little garage shop.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.720]   And it's just the experience of having the huge screens around you.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.840]   You got motion sickness behind me and had to leave.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.640]   When it actually flew through Third World countries via Nam Tokyo, all the buildings
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   are there.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:32.240]   When is the-- there needs to be an MMO for Monopoly with Google Earth.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.800]   They were working on that.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.400]   There was one where you could buy your town and you could buy your street.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.400]   Would that be awesome?
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.560]   Like you could buy buildings, like those 3D buildings and then own them.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.560]   There was.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.400]   Well then there's my town, which is my town.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400]   That's kind of the idea.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.000]   Well, since Second Life, don't they let you do that very much?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.040]   But it's not based on real world stuff.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.240]   It's their own universe, right?
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.440]   It'd be awesome if it was Google Earth-based.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.040]   The impulse was definitely to play.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.240]   I mean, once you're-- so I hope they make that available because as soon as you're
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.680]   on the moon, you want to actually-- everybody wanted to drive the rover around.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:07.280]   And so that's probably the next step is to just have a massive Mars game or something.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.320]   We could all go terraform it or something.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.320]   That'd be pretty sweet.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.560]   So I think-- and actually Robert Scoblin, I wanted to do this and we didn't-- was a
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.680]   debate iPhone versus Android.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.080]   And I think it would have been an interesting debate and I was going to debate the Android
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   side.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.400]   Although Robert pointed out and I think he was accurate, I could flip easily.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.520]   Like halfway through, he was going to say, "Okay, now switch."
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.320]   And it would-- so I think you could make a case for either.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:36.360]   But I have to say that almost always when I hear people extol the virtues of the iPhone,
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.840]   it's things like-- it's just better.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.840]   It's just easier.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.840]   It's just prettier.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.840]   It's a very subjective thing.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.840]   I've got-- I've got--
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840]   I've got--
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.840]   --to feature this Android kills with features.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.520]   So I've got this-- this theory that I have-- I think it holds true is that if you're an
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.080]   iPhone user and you have the iPhone and you've used it for more than six months, to go to
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.440]   Android seems like a step down from a UI standpoint.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.440]   Right.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.280]   And it just doesn't feel as clean.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.000]   There's certain buttons that you wouldn't expect.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.640]   You just get so comfortable with the iPhone, it's hard to make that jump.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.400]   So when I went and bought the Nexus One, or they sent me one, I started playing with
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.400]   it.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.760]   I'm like, "Oh, I could make the jump because there are some features and some apps that
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.200]   they don't have on the iPhone."
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.800]   You can dictate anywhere.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:21.360]   But I just-- it didn't feel as clean and cool.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.360]   It feels as clean.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.360]   You know what I mean?
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.840]   So I think we're going to-- next month's going to be a very telling time.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:32.040]   First of all, at the announcement for Droid X this week on Wednesday, Ruben and Andy
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:37.720]   Rubin of Android said, "We are now installing 160,000 handsets a day.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.160]   That's 5 million a month."
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.160]   Android handsets.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:46.360]   So that-- I mean, when Apple goes, "Hey, we sold 3 million iPads in the last 3 months,
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.840]   they're selling 5 million a month of Android."
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:55.000]   But also, we're going to see-- and by the way, 58,000 apps, at that point, I don't think
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.760]   whether you have 58,000 or a quarter of a million.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.520]   I think you're close enough, right?
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.680]   Does it matter?
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.560]   There is one big difference, though, which is that the big businesses are investing in
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.960]   fantastic experiences on the iPhone, and they're not doing that yet on Android.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.200]   You definitely feel like you're an exile on Android.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   Still?
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:16.320]   Yeah, you get apps like-- it feels like when it mattered to buy software for the Mac and
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.320]   when before everything was on the iPhone.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.320]   It did.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.320]   Right.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.320]   We're used to that as Mac users.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.320]   You know, we'll be like, "Oh, man, six months to get the new game."
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.320]   Right.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.320]   And it feels like that with apps on the Android.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.320]   Right.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.320]   So it's a great way to--
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:31.840]   On the iPhone, you get the Pizza Hut app and the taco time and this and that.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.640]   On Android, you get a metal detector.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.400]   Somebody actually went and hacked up the sensor.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.400]   See?
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.200]   So that you can actually use it as a real metal detector.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.200]   What do you want, Dan?
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.200]   Pizza time or a metal detector?
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   Exactly.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.200]   That's pretty cool.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.200]   It all depends on what matters to you.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.200]   I think you're right.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.520]   I mean, Mintz on there now.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.600]   Every program that I really needed on the iPhone is-- in fact, they have a much better
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.560]   out the Audible app on Android is killer.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.440]   And there is no Audible app on the iPhone.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.800]   People say, "Well, you don't need an app.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   That's the point on the iPhone.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.800]   It just plays them."
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.040]   But on Android, you've got a list of every book you ever bought on Audible.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040]   It gives you stats.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:06.680]   They have badges, four-square-style badges for listeners, listening ship.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.480]   I think that-- I don't know.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.440]   And I think if I'm a developer, I would-- don't you think you'd be scared to develop for iPhone
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.560]   these days and much more comfortable developing for Android, especially when you know there's
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.920]   5 million handsets a month being sold?
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.160]   It seems like a short-term problem that the apps--
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.200]   So, Droid X is the next Motorola Droid.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.200]   Looks pretty sweet.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:36.080]   Looks like the Evo a little bit, 4.3-inch screen, 8 megapixel camera.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.240]   But I'm putting my money on Samsung's Galaxy X, which comes out.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.640]   No one knows, but we think next month.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640]   Have you seen it?
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   Did you see the CTIA?
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   I did.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.040]   And Samsung's in an interesting position because they have this new operating system,
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.880]   Bada, which is their mid-range or cheap smartphone.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   More feature phone.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:57.320]   And they are paying developers, scandals, amounts of money to go bring brilliant experiences
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.320]   to Bada.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.320]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.520]   And from what I've heard of people who've actually lived with the phone, they're wonderful
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.520]   phones.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.520]   They're--
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.520]   Who left the iPhone sensuousness?
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.840]   I haven't got to play with one yet.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.760]   So that's going to be really interesting when suddenly you have feature phone pricing and
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:18.120]   build materials and design and great applications outside of the smartphone ecosystem.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.520]   Samsung's one of the few companies that really could do that.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.480]   I mean, they really have the clout to do that.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.660]   They make the AMOLED screens that are in the Galaxy S4 inch, which is not as big as Evo
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.760]   Android X, but I think bigger than the iPhone.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.400]   I think just about right, actually.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.160]   Yeah, when is too big because I have a hard time--
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.160]   4.3 is big.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.160]   Too much larger than this.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   The Evo looks a little uncomfortable.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.920]   I feel like if your phone needs to kickstand, it's probably too big.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920]   That's one of the things Evo has.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:47.240]   You have to reinforce the lining of your pocket.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.000]   Burns a hole in your pocket.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.440]   Well, here's the good news.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.720]   If you like smartphones, and I think anybody listens to this show, likes having a computer
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.120]   in their pocket, this is a great time.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120]   I mean, you're really--
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120]   Time.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120]   So you're still on the 3GS?
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.120]   I know.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120]   I'm going for soon.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.120]   How retro?
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   Doesn't it look kind of retro?
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.120]   It kind of looks a little retro compared to the 4.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.520]   I still want to buy the original iPhone, like, sealed in box and save it.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.320]   I'll be worth something some time.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   I have the original iPod.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.320]   Do you?
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.320]   Yeah, first gen?
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.320]   I have the newton.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.320]   I have a newton.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.320]   It still works, too.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.320]   That's awesome.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.520]   You know, it works because you put real batteries in the alkaline battery.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.800]   And I haven't used it much.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800]   That's amazing.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.200]   How's the handwriting recognition?
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.200]   First generation iPhone.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.840]   First generation iPod.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.880]   That's the little museum behind it.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.800]   I forgot what the original iPhone felt like.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.640]   Look how big the original iPod was.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640]   That was 5 gigabytes.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   That thing's like a deck of cards.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.040]   And that's got the actual hard drive inside it.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.920]   Yeah, you can almost feel it spin up when you just hold up.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.920]   You could feel it spin up.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.480]   Remember that you feel the little?
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.480]   That's amazing.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480]   I forgot it was Firewire.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.480]   There's the port right on it.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   That's awesome.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.120]   Yeah, I was working it pre-doc.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.360]   You could use a Firewire cable.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.440]   I was working at Microsoft when this came out and everybody was clustered around one
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.280]   of the first ones that somebody brought in.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.120]   And the thing they got everybody just, their heads spinning around was they put a speaker
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:15.200]   in here just so that they could make a click when you turn the wheel.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.200]   That's right.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.720]   That was what blew up for the audience.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.520]   And everybody around the table said, "We would never do that here."
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   No.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.520]   It's bad engineering.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520]   It's crazy.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.760]   And yet it's great UI.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   It's brilliant UI.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   Indeed.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.520]   All right, we're passing around the hardware while we do that.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.560]   Dan Shapiro is here.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.760]   Serial venture, serial entrepreneur.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.840]   Do you want to talk about your latest project?
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:37.840]   What are you working on now?
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.840]   I'm not sure what it was yet.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.840]   You're just in between?
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.240]   I'm playing with some things in e-commerce, some things in online education, some things
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.240]   in mobile app stores and we'll see what...
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.240]   What do you think...
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.240]   Okay, so you have your choice.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.400]   So what category you think is the next big thing?
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   Oh boy.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.400]   Apps?
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.000]   No, Apps for the last big...
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.640]   Location, mobile.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   Those are all old.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.640]   Those are all pretty...
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.800]   You need to be next thing.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:07.000]   Well, one of the things that I'm really excited about right now is the problem of e-commerce
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   is 10 years old.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   And I feel like we are where Search was before Google looked at it.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   10 years ago, Amazon looked at the problem of how to buy things, commodities, a laptop,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.320]   a DVD player, et cetera, and said, "We're going to go do this."
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.360]   And they built this idea of Search.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.360]   So you're looking for something and you go Search for it.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.960]   And then they added to it the idea of Serendipity.
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.680]   So I'm looking at this thing and they say, "What about that thing?"
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.480]   So there's been a renaissance around Serendipity.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.680]   You've got Woot and you've got Groupon and you've got these people at Flash Sale saying,
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.600]   "Here's something you might not have known you needed, but it's entertainment shopping."
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.960]   But nobody's gone back to that original concept of, "I have a problem.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:46.280]   I've got $200, $300, $400 in my pocket to go solve that problem.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.000]   Help me solve that."
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.800]   So I've been spending some time thinking about what is the solution to that look like and
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.800]   how do you help people shopping to solve problems?
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.440]   Do you know what I need?
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.440]   How do I get there?
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.240]   Kind of like a Caterina's hunch.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.160]   That's hunch a little bit.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.760]   I like to think of this.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:02.760]   Hunch for commerce.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760]   Kayak for commerce.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.120]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:09.200]   So you maybe you give them, it's a recommendation engine.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.440]   You give them some parameters and it gives you some ideas.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.080]   I'd be an interesting way to go about it.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.520]   So I'm prototyping a few different approaches right now.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.520]   Simultaneously being secretive and don't know the right answer.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.160]   So I'm playing with you.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.920]   You sound like you know what you're doing.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.840]   Just to see what feels right and what works best.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.480]   We're also Kevin Rose is also here.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.680]   Always a pleasure to have Kevin, one of the original Twitters.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.880]   Episode number one, episode one, actually episode zero two, for that matter.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.520]   Somebody said, "Oh, I'm disappointed.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.320]   Kevin, I don't even get all the rest of the guys on.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.320]   We could do a re-issue."
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.320]   You shouldn't do that.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.320]   Yeah, it'd be really fun to do that.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.320]   Maybe you have a, you know what?
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.600]   I could get a barbecue out there.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.600]   I'll have a cookout.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.600]   Yes.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.600]   And that'd be fun.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.600]   Awesome.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600]   Be friends of Leo.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600]   There are five of them.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.120]   It's a small group.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.480]   But a nice bunch of people.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.480]   We'll do that.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.480]   We'll definitely do that.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:02.400]   Also, Tim Shea is here from next new networks.com and Dean Putney from Boing Boing.net.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.800]   He's a developer at Boing Boing.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.440]   We'll be back with more in just a bit, but I want to tell you a little bit about audible.com
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.840]   and a very special deal from Audible right now.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.000]   They call it the Big Summer Listen.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.160]   If you go to audible.com/summer, you can get a book absolutely free.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.120]   And when I free, I mean no strings.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.760]   You don't even need to give them a credit card.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.240]   You don't even need to, you know, nothing.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.440]   Just take a book.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.600]   They only do this once a year.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.120]   So this is the time to do this.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.120]   Audible.com/summer.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.560]   You're going to choose from one of, well, it looks like they said eight books, but now
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.280]   it looks like 12, 16.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.760]   There's quite a, it's an unlimited number.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.160]   It's a huge number.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.520]   It's a free audio book giveaway, but you cannot do this if you're an Audible member.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.360]   So Audible members don't go there.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.920]   And if you want to become an Audible member, then I can get you three books free.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.920]   How about that?
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.480]   Look at all these books.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480]   This is great.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.040]   The Lost Fleet.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.040]   Master and Commander.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.040]   That's a great way.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.040]   Boy, Audible's smart.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.400]   The Reed Master and Commander, they're going to get you for 21 more books for the whole
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.760]   series of Patrick O'Brien books.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:08.760]   That's smart.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.760]   First one's free.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.400]   It's one of my favorite things.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.760]   I am legend.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.760]   The Good Earth.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:20.040]   Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the next 100 years by George Freeman, a really good book.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.120]   Jane Austen's Persuasion says a lot of books in here.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.800]   The time traveler's wife, I just read this.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:25.800]   I loved it.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.800]   Life of Pi.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.120]   Maybe the best audiobook ever made.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.320]   The Road, another great one.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.320]   Outlander.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320]   Wow.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.920]   Stiff by Mary Roach.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:35.920]   The story of Death.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:36.920]   Oh, that's a really interesting one.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:37.920]   Isn't that a great book?
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.920]   And Boink.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.920]   It's companion.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:40.920]   Stiff and Boink.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.920]   Brilliant.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.120]   I just finished Boink.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.000]   It's all about science and sex.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.520]   Is Damon on there?
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.520]   Damon is not.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.920]   But you know, okay, so here's the deal.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.840]   I'm going to, actually, this is what we're going to do this.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:59.920]   You go to audible.com/twit2, you can sign up for the Audible Platinum account.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.480]   That's two free books.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.000]   And absolutely get Daniel Suarez's two books.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.640]   They're really one book written in two different volumes.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:14.480]   There's Damon, D-A-E-M-O-N, and then Freedom TM.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.480]   So you get those free.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.920]   But don't do that until after you've gone audible.com/sour and picked a book there,
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:25.360]   like Stiff, David Sidaris, Live at Carnegie Hall, Little B, tons of books here.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.400]   So pick a book, get it free for the summer audio book, give away.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:34.240]   That's audible.com/sour then go to audible.com/twit2 and you have scammed them out of three books,
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.400]   my friend, at no cost to you.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.880]   Three free books.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.520]   Go to audible.com/twit2 and take advantage of the summer of reading because they do this
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.680]   once a year and it's really great.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.240]   And it's only good through, I think, July 2nd.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.200]   So if you're listening to this after July 2nd, whoops, I should have warned you.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.680]   There's nothing there.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:59.120]   Audible.com/sour then audible.com/twit2 and as always, we thank Audible for their support.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.800]   And by the way, if you do have an XS1, the Audible app on here is just great.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.400]   It gives you everything you've ever listened to.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.720]   Because once you buy a book on Audible, it's yours for life.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.760]   You can take it off, you don't have to leave it on the device.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.160]   So every book I've ever bought, I mean, there's 300, 400 books here.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.440]   Because I've been Audible members since...
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.200]   Is there an Audible iPhone app, too?
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.200]   No.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.720]   I wish they would do this for the iPhone because it's really fantastic.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.720]   You don't need it for the iPhone.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.640]   Because the iPhone, you just listen on the iPod.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.760]   But I like this better because you could bookmark.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.440]   You get these, like I said, badges.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.600]   They've got you give you stats.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.560]   Like, here's the stats.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.560]   It's like, I'm a rank beginner.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.120]   Audible Master, Audible Newbie, novice pro, scholar.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.600]   Then they show you how many hours you spent their badges.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.560]   See like four square style badges on there?
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.440]   This is in beta right now, but it's really sweet.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.400]   Listen, I'm out of time you spent listening.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.080]   Today, monthly daily.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.000]   Oh, here's a graph.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   This is for nerds who love stats.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.880]   It's just very smart.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:11.800]   Audible.com, let me thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.520]   So what else?
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.560]   I haven't really been paying attention to tech news.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.880]   Any other big stories that affected you?
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.920]   Kevin Russ, I think the big story is a big forum.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.160]   I'm really excited about this.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.160]   Thank you.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.160]   You only have them back.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.160]   It's done, actually.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.160]   We just turned it off.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.160]   It's 4.30.
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.160]   It's 4.30.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.160]   It's 4.30.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.280]   Man, I hope you got a chance to play with it.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.240]   And how soon before you think it'll come out?
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:40.240]   We're going to start inviting people probably tomorrow or the next day at about 10,000 or
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.240]   so a day.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.240]   Go there anyway.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.280]   Go to new.dig.com and just sign up.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.600]   Yeah, sign up and we'll put you on the list.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.080]   And then we'll send you an invite very soon.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.720]   I think this is going to transform a dig.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.120]   And I'm going to use it more.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.360]   In fact, I'm thinking I'm going to start using it to bookmark stories for our shows.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.840]   We wanted to do that ages ago, but I think this is the time to do it.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.440]   Submitting content is much easier now.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.440]   It's like two clicks.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.440]   It's awesome.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.440]   I like that.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:13.160]   See, iPhone we talked about.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.160]   We talked about Android.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.840]   Dan, anything that's on your mind these days, any big tech stories you thought were interesting?
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.160]   We've just been locked up in a room for the last three days.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.160]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.160]   Yeah, totally off the grid.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:26.160]   It was kind of fun.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.160]   It's kind of fun, isn't it?
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.040]   You know, I was at Newsfoe, Stephen Levy, who writes for wire, but was it Newsweek and
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.040]   wrote Hackers?
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.640]   By the way, I got the 25th edition of Hackers and I got Stephen to sign it.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.640]   I'm so happy.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   Awesome.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   Smart, huh?
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:46.760]   He's just great, but we're talking about this Rolling Stone article.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.880]   I thought this was quite interesting.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:53.000]   I kind of wasn't paying attention because of the Apple thing and then going off to a
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.520]   food camp.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:19:00.160]   Rolling Stone, not known for its political reporting, sent a reporter out to, if you're
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.440]   General McChrystal and got him off the record, on the record rather, saying all sorts of
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.440]   things.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.440]   He got fired on Wednesday.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.120]   And I don't think it's true that they're not known for their political reporting.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.960]   I think they do that once every...
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.960]   Once in a while, you're right.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.400]   And when they do, it's great.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.840]   Like, you know, Gonzo reporting was born there.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.840]   Mm-hmm.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.840]   You're right, actually.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.840]   It's not fair to them, is it?
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.840]   They had Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.920]   So that was a topic of conversation this week.
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.880]   What's on anything on your mind, Tim, anything?
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.640]   Tell me about next new networks.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.440]   What's the latest for you guys?
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:37.360]   Well, we had like a big week where we put up a new site called nextnewbillion.com.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   That's really...
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.880]   It's really just for our fans and sort of changed the end card on all our videos.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.280]   We're passing a billion views, I think.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.680]   You passed a billion views?
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.680]   Holy cow.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.680]   That's like Lady Gaga.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.000]   Yeah, it's us and Lady Gaga and a couple other people.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.680]   And yeah, so it's pretty cool.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.560]   It took us about 8,000 videos to do it.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:58.920]   So, you know, the backwards way we've been thinking about that is if your average video
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:03.480]   on the web gets 100 lifetime views, you know, the average video we've put out has gotten
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.040]   about 125,000.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.560]   And you know, people haven't heard of next new networks so much, but you know, we're
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.680]   the people that did the Obama girl videos and we've spun a lot of political comedy
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.000]   off of that.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.080]   And you know, we've got all these other channels like Andy Mughal and Threadbanger.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:20.600]   And now we're starting to move into things like food with hunger nation and fitness
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.760]   network called Click Fitness.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:26.400]   So that whole way of just locking up with independent producers and just helping them
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.360]   succeed, you know, is really starting to pay off.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:33.560]   So next new billion, if you don't know what we do, you can just go there and there's like
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:38.760]   a playlist of about 80 of 80 videos with over 100,000 views that sort of give a sort of
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   show you might have seen one of them over the years.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.720]   I was talking to Dina Kaplan at foodcampofblip.tv.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720]   That's great.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:49.600]   She was saying, and maybe you've seen this at revision three as well, that advertising
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:56.000]   support for video IP video networks is jumped at the end of last year and this year.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   It's been our experience as well.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   It's been pretty crazy.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   This is very good news.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.920]   You know, we've all kind of known each other in the industry forever and we've all been
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:05.920]   struggling for years.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.920]   I mean, we've all shared info along the way and you know, the hard thing with online
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.960]   videos that we're not actually competing with each other.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.280]   It's not like someone goes, you know, I really want to advertise on a web video, but I just
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.360]   can't decide between revision three and I can't wait to that day.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.400]   You know, we're trying to compete with every single website and piece of content on the
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.400]   web.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.520]   The same RF music gets sent to us, gets sent to Facebook and Google.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.080]   So you know, it's every time one of us goes out there and I talked to Dina a lot about
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.560]   this and I've talked to Kevin's colleagues at revision three a lot about this is that,
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.480]   you know, we're not only trying to sell ourselves, but we're trying to sell the whole
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.880]   medium every time we go out the door.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.160]   And it's been three years of really hard work, you know, getting it up to level where
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.360]   we're all, if not profitable, I think pretty close to profitable across the board.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.120]   It's pretty crazy how the advertisers have changed too.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.560]   Like initially it was like, you know, tech brands, things like that.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.440]   And now like, you know, we just did Ford sponsor Ignatian last time.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.440]   Wow.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.440]   And it's like, it's crazy.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.440]   You know, big brands.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.440]   Big brands.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.440]   And I think that's really exciting.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.440]   I mean, this is, this is mainstream.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.520]   I mean, when you see, when you see a billion views, you know, that's, that's 50 million
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:12.600]   views a month and we've had, you know, five renewals with Warner Brothers.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.560]   We've done like, you know, it's real brands that are, they're coming in Samsung, American
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.440]   Express, you know, that, you know, they're, they're starting to realize that audiences
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:20.440]   are moving here.
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.280]   And all we need is, I did some, I did some conference of the Dan, you know, all we need
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.440]   is just a small percentage of that's the thing.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:30.080]   The advertising like come over and we'd all be able to say billion dollars or something.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:34.360]   So we're seeing some really interesting things that photo bucket and we've been user-generated
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.360]   content forever.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.680]   A little bit of video, mostly pictures and about 160 billion media views a month.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.680]   And what we're seeing is the, the interest is coming up exactly like you're saying, the
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:48.120]   other thing that's really fun is we're starting to see the interest on the mobile platforms
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.120]   as well.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.720]   And people are saying, how can we connect with people wherever they are?
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.520]   And that's where you have an advantage, right?
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:58.880]   Cause I mean, I guess I was watching this World Cup on my iPhone though on all BTV.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.280]   I was, I have to confess, I was in a very boring session.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.200]   You know, it was everything I could do.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.120]   Is that why the Wi-Fi network was so good?
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:11.360]   We were all watching the, we're starting to see a lot of your show come from the YouTube
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.200]   mobile app, you know, and, and, you know, there's not a lot of space in the YouTube mobile
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.200]   app.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.200]   But you know, if you're one of the, if you're one of the featured videos on YouTube that
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.520]   day, you know, one of those first four that are on the front page, that means you're also
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.320]   on the mobile app and we'll see a, just a huge percentage of our traffic for the day
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.320]   come from there.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.800]   So people are using it, you know, we're not exactly sure who or how.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.760]   But, but, um, I think that, you know, we've all been waiting for like 10 years.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.000]   We've always said people are going to start watching a lot of video on mobile phones.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.800]   I think it's, it's finally starting to happen.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.960]   A couple other big stories that I actually didn't neglect to mention.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.320]   One is there's a price war between the Kindle and the Nook.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.720]   Big drop on the price of the Amazon Kindle, uh, down to what, what is it?
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.720]   $59, $189, $50 drop.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:56.400]   And the Nook, if you don't want wife, if you want to, if I only is $149 now, I thought
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.760]   it was free with a cup of coffee.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.760]   Practically.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.920]   Um, is that in response to the iPad or is it in response to each other?
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:03.920]   Are they fighting?
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:04.920]   First of all worlds.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.880]   I mean, they're just getting jumped on both sides.
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.160]   So now you can spend, you know, a lot more money and get the iPad, which is the sexy version
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.160]   of the Kindle, right?
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:16.280]   And you've got them competing with each other and it turned out, I will never understand
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.880]   why Amazon did not decide to be the bookstore instead of trying to be the book.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.880]   I mean, it's all well.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.200]   Well, I was told, here's the deal.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.280]   I was told there's two divisions.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.360]   There's a hardware division and there's this, there's the book division, the software division.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.040]   And that's why I was surprised.
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:34.240]   We saw such a great software app on the iPad because I thought, well, that's got to kill
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.240]   the Kindle.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.240]   It's different divisions.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.800]   And, and actually that's smart off Jeff Bezos.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.080]   They're, you know, they're, they're fighting each other.
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.080]   That's fine.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.440]   Each your own young, each, each your babies, they say at Microsoft.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.720]   You know, there was an angle to a story that I just heard about that was really exciting
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.200]   to me, which was I've heard about the Kinect, you know, formerly Project Utah, this new
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.200]   controller.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.320]   And I didn't really get what all the fuss was about.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.480]   So this is a webcam.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.280]   This is some new algorithms for it.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.160]   And finally, I got somebody at Microsoft in the research group to explain to me what all
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.760]   the fuss was about and it's fascinating.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:07.240]   Am I the only person who doesn't know how this works or is it about the locking it on
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.240]   the skeleton thing?
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.440]   Well, it's how they do it.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.200]   So it turns out there's so, the Kinect is, is there is, it's a bar that you attach to the
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.200]   Xbox 360.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.240]   It'll be out in November, 150 bucks.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.920]   It's got an RGB camera and a depth sensor in it.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.200]   It looks like a microphone array and it's three sensors.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.040]   It was the depth sensor that's the magic.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040]   So the trick is how do you find depth?
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.000]   Well, you put two cameras and you see how deep it is.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.320]   Well, how do you know what the same thing is?
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.000]   Because if I know that's your head, then I can figure out far away, but is it your
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   head?
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   Is it the book behind it?
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.480]   And the magic is that the second camera, it's two cameras.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.480]   The second one is an infrared camera.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.840]   And they're projecting a grid onto you in infrared.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:43.840]   Wow.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.200]   The infrared camera is scanning the grid.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:50.720]   So it can actually determine how far you are, can triangulate and find.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.520]   So that's how they know where you are in the room and the rest of it's all just software.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.600]   They also have an array mic, which will help them do voice records.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.600]   Right.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.600]   Right.
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:25:59.600]   It's cool.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.600]   You jump in and it knows it's you.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.600]   It puts your avatar up.
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.520]   If one person is playing a single player game and you jump in, then it becomes a two-player
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.840]   game automatically.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.600]   And playing it is actually surprisingly fun.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.600]   I was very skeptical.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.600]   I saw that.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.800]   I like everybody else so fully should they jump around like a goon last year.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.000]   And I thought this is stupid.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   I hate the Wii.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.320]   We never did anything for me.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:19.320]   And this is not the Wii.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.320]   This is really, really fun.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.320]   Did you get to play?
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.320]   Yeah, I did.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.320]   I liked it.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:24.320]   I did.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.320]   I did.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.320]   I did.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.320]   I really liked it.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.320]   I thought it was a lot of fun.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.320]   Another, let's see, another big story.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.320]   What the domains?
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.160]   X, X, X, X, SEXAY.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.080]   Oh, yes.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.080]   And you know what's funny?
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.080]   I love it.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:41.880]   Anything that both porn producers and the religious right hate has got to be different.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.080]   It's got to be interesting.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.960]   The porn producers don't like it because I guess they're afraid of being censored like
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.960]   being a ghetto on the web.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.360]   Of course, the right doesn't like it because it tells people exactly where to go to get
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.360]   it.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360]   Well, they'll have to buy their domains again.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   So it's going to be very expensive for them.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.640]   Yeah, if you're Playboy.com, are they going to force them to go to Playboy.triple X?
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.640]   No.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.800]   No, they just have to buy Playboy.triple X.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.840]   But more to the point, they have to go buy all the misspellings.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.160]   And for Playboy.com, that might not be such a big deal.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.120]   But I built this porn site in my basement.com.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.120]   That's a big deal.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:17.840]   Or so I would know anything about that.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:21.840]   So I've got an interesting little anecdote.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.480]   Fireaway Dean Putney.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:26.240]   Last night, the iPhone 4 was jailbroken.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.240]   That's right.
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.920]   Soric was at the Pufu Cam and he was very excited.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:34.240]   Yeah, this was at like four o'clock in the morning and I'm sitting there with Chris Poole
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:41.400]   and Soric and he's working on this and did the jailbreak of the second iPhone 4.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.400]   Well, at Fucamp.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.640]   Actually, others were doing it, but he was part of the...
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.480]   You were a 15-year-old did it in the city.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.960]   And by the way, it's pronounced Sidia I found out, which I never knew.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.400]   I thought it was Sidia.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.520]   Sidia is now on the iPhone 4.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.520]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.520]   It's amazing.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.520]   That's fast.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.520]   That's fast.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.520]   1% and 2%.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.520]   And a 17-year-old.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.520]   I love it.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.520]   And I'm sorry because Sidia is Soric.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.520]   And it's just one guy.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.520]   It's just him.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.840]   He demonstrated something that blew my mind.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:17.080]   He showed a way to take running code on an iPhone and inject your code into it.
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.760]   So you could, for instance, like when you're pressing a hold on the iPhone and they jiggle,
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:25.520]   jiggle, jiggle, you can have it instead go transparent and jiggle or...
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.040]   You could take over a program and running program and inject your own code into it.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.040]   I don't know what the...
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.040]   Yeah, that was fascinating.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:38.080]   He said that he could actually overwrite any C function on the iPad or the iPhone.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:42.360]   And so he was connecting to it over Wi-Fi and I guess they had written a protocol that
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:50.800]   used very simple object sent transfers and it was all sort of similar to JavaScript or
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.800]   JavaScript-based.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.320]   And so it was like he was just changing things on the fly and it was immediate.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.320]   I asked him about it.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.200]   It's part of it because Apple uses such consistent naming of its variables.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.680]   It's very easy to figure out what's going on, what it's doing.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.240]   Simple thing.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.240]   F-forward.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.240]   Kevin, tell me about that.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.240]   That's a new show.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.680]   You guys are doing it on revision three?
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.480]   That's going to be my next thing after Ignatian.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.480]   It's just...
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.480]   I'm just calling it forward.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.480]   But it's...
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.480]   There's two Fs.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:21.160]   Yeah, I couldn't get forward.com or FWD.com or any of the other things that I wanted.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:27.600]   So it's just F-F-O-R-W-A-R-D.com and that will be coming soon.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.360]   So it's only a newsletter sign up for him right now.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.520]   But what is it?
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.760]   It's going to be just kind of a new show that I've been wanting to do for a while like we
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.440]   were talking about before.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.680]   Something that it's going to be a combination of geek culture type show.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:46.640]   So not really tech news but more kind of just having these different entrepreneurs that
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.640]   I meet all the time in the Bay Area come on and talk about what they're doing, demo
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.640]   products.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:57.680]   A lot of people come on and talk about geek fashion or I know this guy that's really
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.400]   passionate about cooking the best steak.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.120]   Have him come on and explain how to make the best steak.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.400]   I mean just a little bit of everything.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.600]   Is it a revision three show or are you just going to do yourself?
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.600]   It's going to be a rev three show.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.600]   Cool.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.760]   And so yeah, it's going to be fun.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:11.920]   Revision three also added Callie Lewis and Geek Brief which is very exciting.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:12.920]   I'm really happy to hear that.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:13.920]   Yeah, it was awesome.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:15.920]   She's the greatest.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.920]   Well, we're done.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:21.080]   I want to thank everybody for coming out.
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.480]   Kevin Rose from dig.com.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:24.880]   Congratulations on the new dig for all.
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.800]   I'll look very with great interest to see it when it launches in the next few weeks.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:30.800]   Sweet.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.240]   And for those of you who are watching live, you get a chance to play with it before
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:34.920]   anybody and break it.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.960]   But no, I think it held up very well.
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:38.960]   That's a good sign.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:39.960]   Yeah, very good sign.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.440]   So glad also to have entrepreneur Dan Shapiro here.
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.800]   It was really nice for you.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:49.720]   You popped in at the last minute and so glad you did on your way home from the camp.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:52.200]   250 new followers at Dan Shapiro.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.200]   You're kidding.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.840]   We didn't even mention it yet at Dan Shapiro at Dan Shapiro.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:00.200]   Let's even get them to 500 new followers at Dan Shapiro.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.280]   I'll put it right up here.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.720]   And of course, don't forget pickle sauce hamster.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.720]   No, no, wait a minute.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.840]   I'm sure it's something like that mustard.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.840]   That's disgusting.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.920]   Dean Putney is mustard hamster.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:13.920]   Oh, doctor.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.920]   Oh, doctor.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.920]   Oh, doctor.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:16.920]   I'm not going to forget you.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.920]   Don't worry, oh, doctor.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.920]   Don't forget.
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:21.320]   I'm not going to forget.
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:22.320]   That was better.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.800]   I love.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:28.040]   We looked at like that Rosie Greer movie where he had two heads.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:31.200]   Actually, I see since one is darker than the other.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.200]   Well, I think it was.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.200]   I think it was.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.040]   Who was the other guy in their head with Rosie Greer?
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.040]   Do you remember that movie?
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.920]   I think I missed this one.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.960]   I think maybe I'm having a bad nightmare.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:42.960]   I don't know.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.280]   You can't have my phone for.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.840]   I love you, doctor.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.840]   I'll give it back.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:47.840]   Oh, doctor.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.840]   It's all smashed.
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.600]   Now, I know a guy up in Roaner Park will fix that for $85, dude.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:53.600]   $85?
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.600]   That's cheap.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.600]   He'll just replace the glass.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.840]   Yeah, deal.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:58.840]   Where was I?
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:31:59.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:00.840]   Hamster mustard.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:01.840]   Mustard hamster.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.440]   Dean Putney, thank you for coming by developer Boing Boing.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:07.480]   Follow him at mustard hamster.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.720]   And despite the fact that they misspelled it on hamster dance, there is no P.
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:12.720]   And hamster.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:13.720]   That's right.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.080]   It's actually mustard hamsters, plural.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.080]   There's more than one.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.080]   That's scary.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.080]   Wow.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.080]   Mustard hamsters.
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.080]   Who has the hamster?
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.080]   Just the...
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.080]   They're out there.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.080]   Oh, I'm scared.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.080]   It could be a soulmate.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:31.040]   It could be a lady that has the other one or no?
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.040]   Oof.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.040]   I can't tell you that.
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.040]   I'm not telling you.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:38.800]   Tim Shay is celebrating one billion views now on next new networks.com.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:39.800]   Congrats on that.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:40.800]   That's really good.
