[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.500]   This week in Tech, the show that covers the tech news from the week gone by,
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.700]   and there was a whole heck of a lot of it.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.800]   Because it's the Memorial Day weekend here in the US of A,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.300]   we have decided to put together a practically international panel.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.100]   We almost got 100% international, but that's okay.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.400]   We'll start with Canada.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.500]   Amber MacArthur is here.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.000]   I don't have to introduce Amber MacArthur.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.800]   Everybody knows Amber from the Social Hour, my host on Call for Help many moons ago.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.100]   Hey, it's good to be on the show.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.900]   It's been a while.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.200]   Welcome back.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.100]   And she's calling from Toronto.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.300]   Yes, I am in Toronto.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.600]   I'm home and it has surpassed patio weather.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.800]   You'll be happy to hear Leo.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.000]   Nice and hot there, huh?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.800]   It's getting there.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.500]   Yeah, it's definitely heating up.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.800]   You and Sarah are doing such a great job with the Social Hour,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.600]   which is kind of just the rebranded version of the show inside the net.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   Then it was net at night.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.500]   Now it's a social hour with the Internet keeps changing, damn it.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.100]   I know, and we keep changing, but it's been a great experience over the past 10 episodes.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.200]   And she's so much fun to work with.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   She's hilarious.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.800]   Sarah's great.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.400]   And I love the show.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.700]   Sarah is, you know, Sarah's role at Twit is to keep me informed and what the trends are.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.100]   So I figure she really should be doing a show about, you know, Internet trends.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.300]   Oh, yeah, she's perfect.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.400]   And we have lots of audience participation.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.600]   And so it's been really fun just doing some episodes with her and lots to look forward to.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.000]   And she's great at producing too, Leo.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.700]   That's a nice thing.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.800]   You know, she really understands how to package a show and kind of put it together with lots of different elements.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.900]   It's my, it's my new favorite show actually on Twitter.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.100]   But if you have not seen it, the social hour, you do the show on Mondays and it's available
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.900]   for download almost immediately at twit.tv/ I think we still have it on night though, right?
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.900]   Twit.tv is it slash an ATM, Jammer B?
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.900]   Oh, not sure.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.400]   Is it?
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   Is it?
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   It's SH?
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   Yes.

[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   Also with us today, Mr. O'Malley who's got money in his pocket.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.800]   Not in my pocket.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   Don't even have a pocket.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.500]   Oh, is the guy behind Gig Aome, which is a great site and also has his own new newsletter,
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.100]   which is, how many weeks old is this?
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.100]   Oh, it says.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.300]   It's about eight weeks old.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.300]   Okay.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.300]   Good.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.300]   And it's a paid subscription?
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.000]   No, it's, I like it when I have something important to say.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.800]   I don't write it if just to fill up space.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.300]   So it's, it's free and you sign up and sometimes I write four times a week.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.040]   Sometimes I write twice a week and sometimes I don't.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.980]   It's only when I have something to say that's when I go for it.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.140]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.180]   I think there's just too much noise on the internet.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.900]   So what I'm trying to do is not to act to it.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.900]   Doesn't it?
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.500]   I'm sure it does feel like as a blogger, you've just kind of post every day.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.100]   And even if you have nothing important to say.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.140]   Well, like we have a great team.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.620]   So they post interesting things every day.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.220]   I try and reframe myself from doing, you know, just adding more noise to people's life.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.580]   That's what I like it.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.180]   But why don't you charge for it?
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.620]   How many could probably charge a hundred bucks a month for this?
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.500]   No, but you know, this is, I would have written this as a blog post and I would have given
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.300]   it away as free.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.420]   So there's no difference in that.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.740]   It just goes out as an email and then later in the day, like about 12 hours later, it
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.060]   goes up as a blog post.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.260]   So I don't, you know, I don't think that, you know, you can charge for something you've
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.500]   been doing away for free for so long.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   It's interesting.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   I guess newsletters are kind of back for a while.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.780]   It seemed like nobody was doing it.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.780]   Now everybody is.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.780]   Everybody I know wants to write a newsletter.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.780]   There you go.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.540]   And I am calling from people's Republic of California.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.540]   That's international.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.540]   That's international.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.980]   That's good to have you.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.340]   Now from France, we've got Patrick Bezia.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.340]   Great.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.940]   Hey, it's nice to be back.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.380]   Not Patrick on Twitter.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.380]   That's me.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.300]   And he has a bunch of podcasts.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.940]   I should really do what all of his doing, but actually when I have something to say,
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.020]   just go on Twitter.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.660]   So it's not that smart.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.780]   I should start to give it in a way.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.900]   Although Twitter is only 140 characters, I find that actually a great relief because
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.380]   posting a long blog post.
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.380]   It takes a long time.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.700]   What I have to say is not that complicated.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.700]   Right.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.460]   140 characters is way enough.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.460]   Right.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.100]   We actually, I'm glad Patrick's here because one of our top stories is the E.G.8.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.020]   The G.8 summit is coming to France next week.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.780]   All the leaders of the major developed nations, the US, Canada, France, England, Germany and
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.780]   so forth.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.700]   The G.8 summit.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.140]   The week before President Sarkozy, who's not known for being a champion of the free
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:41.420]   internet, through a little party for internet big wigs, including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:49.820]   of Amazon, Eric Schmidt of Google, to create a white paper, a position paper to present
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.020]   to the G.8 leaders on how the internet should be regulated.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.620]   The fear was, I know Corey Doctorow wrote, "I'm not going to be able to do this."
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:06.380]   "I'm not going to go because this is just an attempt to get us to kind of rubber stamp
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.860]   something that I can't possibly agree with."
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:15.980]   Sarkozy is so notorious for his kind of pro-business anti-free internet stance.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.220]   What did the E.G.A. end up being like, Patrick?
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:27.180]   Well, I guess it's difficult to explain because a lot of people were expecting it to be something
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.380]   that it wasn't meant to be.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:37.380]   I think, okay, what you have to remember is, we in the tech world know what we should be
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.620]   doing and what works and what doesn't work, even from a technical standpoint, set aside
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.820]   the ethical and moral implications of regulating the internet.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:52.900]   But you have to remember that the governments do not know what the hell even that internet
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.180]   thing is.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.260]   So I was one of the very few voices, I think, that thought this E.G.A. was actually a good
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:06.580]   idea because it was the government's recognizing that maybe they didn't have all the answers
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.340]   and trying to include everyone in the conversation.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.580]   And of course, at first they're going to ask the people that they know and the people
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.540]   that they would go to anyway who have no clue either.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:25.300]   You know, the music lobby and the movie lobby and intellectual property rights holders.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.540]   But it's a willingness to open the conversation.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:37.540]   And I think we have to be part of that conversation and just look at how much voice Jeff Gott
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:46.380]   and JP Barlow Gott and a few others and compare that to things like ACTA and the Protect IP
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.740]   Act, which are complete horrors negotiated in secret.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.700]   So it's starting the conversation, I think.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.020]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.900]   You know, I was one of the people invited thanks to Louis Glamour and couldn't go because
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.420]   of family emergency.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.900]   But I was really glad to see Jeff Jarvis of this week in Google show go.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:11.060]   And he wrote a blog post before he left saying, "I'm going to try to get Sarkozy and others
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:17.380]   to essentially sign a Hippocratic oath for the internet that the first and foremost government
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.020]   would do no harm.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.860]   Jeff and I and many others, I know John Parrot, Perry Barlow believe that government should
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.500]   just keep its mitts off of the internet that the pendulum has swung too far in the direction
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.460]   of rights holders.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:36.260]   And you know, I felt like, yeah, even if there's going to be some attempt to kind of whitewash
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:43.860]   what we say, if we don't come to the table, then we've kind of lost our right to complain.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.860]   So I was...
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.100]   Yeah, there's definitely part of that.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   And it's...
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.700]   I mean, there's a lot of people who think there is bad intentions to begin with.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.100]   Like, okay, we'll say that they were included and we'll do what we want anyway.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.420]   But that they could have done even without the EG8.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.260]   And remember, this is related to the G8, which is if you want to talk to governments, there's
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.180]   no bigger venue.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:16.940]   And also, I have to say, as much as I appreciate the intent behind the Hippocratic oath, I think
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:22.340]   there's a little bit of a disconnect between what we know and you know, you can't tell
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.380]   the government first do no harm to the internet.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.140]   They won't even understand what that is about.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.420]   Well, it sets actually what Sarkozy's reaction was.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.420]   Well, what do you mean?
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.900]   Of course, I'm not going to do any harm to the internet because they don't understand
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.500]   that the kinds of restrictions like the three strikes law they're talking about, they don't
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.780]   understand that that's perceived by many as harmful.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.060]   They say, no, no, we're just protecting rights holders.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.780]   You wouldn't want an internet where piracy was rampant and widespread.
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.780]   That's not good.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.700]   Do no harm means preventing that.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:02.260]   And Sarkozy was a little bit, you know, a guest, he ended up regaining his composure.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.980]   I thought it was quite violent.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.460]   Yeah, yeah, no, he answered quite well in the end.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.420]   But at first he was like, do you know what do you mean?
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.420]   Of course.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.420]   Right, right.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.420]   Right.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.420]   I don't, I don't do it.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.700]   Oh, where do you ever thought about this?
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.380]   Have you been, did you follow the EGA summit?
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:26.860]   So I was also invited, I refuse to go for one basic reason, which is that, you know,
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:36.940]   I don't, given a man has to prove his intent by his actions and not by empty words.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:44.740]   So when a politician invites me for something, I'm already on guard because, and the French
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:52.660]   president has had a pretty bad track record of being, you know, I'm not, I think, you
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:58.220]   know, you made a comment earlier saying that anti-business and anti-internet, I think those
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:04.740]   are two, I think you can be pro-business and pro-internet at the same time.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:10.180]   And all you need is to think differently about what internet represents.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.580]   So from that perspective, I thought this was a bit of a, bit of a sham.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.900]   And, and frankly, this is a group of people, group of countries which are trying to define
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.900]   the internet.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:27.820]   When the internet is going to be defined by 2.5 billion people who are not really represented
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.820]   in the G.A.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.820]   Right.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:37.820]   So it's actually arrogant and, and, you know, annoying to see French people trying to define
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:43.740]   the future of the internet looks like, if I need to know that I think the dialogue has
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.900]   to be with people from, you know, the representatives of China, representatives of India, people
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:55.420]   from Brazil, Russia, and, and, and from people of the African continent.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.260]   But you have to start somewhere, I mean, the cuts, that's incredibly disingenuous.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:07.020]   You're talking in, in theory, in theoretical, yes, ideally that should be the case, but you
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.140]   know that's never going to be that way, at least not in the short, short term, the people
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.940]   who are going to decide how things are handled are, you know, the U.S. first and then France
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.940]   and the other countries in the G.A.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.300]   We can't, I disagree with you entirely on that because if you look at how China and, and
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:32.020]   Brazil and, and India, Russia evolving as internet economies, they're not taking their
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:37.940]   cue from the U.S. they're, they're doing their, that's an entirely different kind of
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.340]   an internet forming.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.580]   They have a whole different, you know, DNA when it comes to the internet.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.220]   I think what we are talking about is, is two different internet.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:55.060]   Because the internet, as we've known so far, has been very Western, you know, influenced.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.540]   But I think now is beginning to change.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.540]   One thing.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.340]   Sorry, sorry Amber, go ahead.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.340]   No, no, it's okay.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.700]   I just, you know, one thing that just comes to mind when we're talking about this is I
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.460]   wonder how a group of people who come together at a conference like this, which is, you know,
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.540]   kind of an international conference, can really talk about the fate of the internet when I
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.340]   view it as something that is really country specific.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.420]   And when I say that, I think of Canada, for instance, where there are people in this country
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.100]   who are fighting, have been fighting a long time with the government to make sure that
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:27.660]   the major telcos don't restrict bandwidth and have plans that are based on bandwidth and
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.740]   we're really fighting towards eliminating those type of plans.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.940]   So even though a group of people, I think internationally, who get together and talk
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.740]   about the future of the internet, I think that's a great thing.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.980]   I really see this as something where, you know, country by country, it's treated so differently.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.740]   I guess I understand what you're saying though, Om, that is that it's like recasting of the
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:51.780]   white man's burden, that these eight nations should decide something for the whole world
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.940]   is kind of foolish.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.300]   But, and I agree it was an ideal, but that's why I wanted to go.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.100]   At least you kind of have to, at some point you have to start the conversation.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.660]   Would you prefer to see some other conference?
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.940]   Not a conference.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:13.820]   I think the government actually has to keep its, you know, before it gets involved.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:20.460]   And before they do that, they actually need to educate themselves and not have conferences.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:27.100]   They need to know, and I absolutely, you know, I see it locally here in the US.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:32.340]   We have, you know, lawmakers who have, you know, some of them have not even used email
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.740]   and they're trying to regulate the law.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:43.260]   So you know, it just is you have to be, this is not a conversation which happens at a conference,
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:51.900]   which is basically in my, it was more to showcase, you know, a certain person as like a future
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.900]   leader.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.900]   Sarkozy.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.100]   So, well, there is, there is some of this definitely, and absolutely, I don't want to
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.780]   be naive and say that he wasn't, you know, trying to make something political out of
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.780]   it.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:08.500]   But what you were saying is some people who don't have email are writing laws about the
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   Internet.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.500]   That's exactly the issue.
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.940]   I think this is their way of saying, okay, what we've been trying until now is not working.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.420]   So let's talk and let's have a conversation.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.540]   And I also think that we're talking about two different things.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.820]   When you're saying we should include all the, you know, China and Brazil and these other
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.460]   countries that are indeed huge and that will matter a lot, this is not exactly what we're
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.460]   talking about here.
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:35.060]   We're talking more about what Amber was mentioning, which is net neutrality and restricting bed
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.460]   width and how to protect IP and very immediate issues that are threatening to break the Internet
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.780]   from our rich country's perspectives.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.780]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:51.980]   I mean, let's not forget that ACTA, which is probably the single most destructive treaty
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:58.780]   with regards to the Internet, is really a product of US intellectual property rights
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.980]   companies, of the movie companies, the record industry, who influenced the world intellectual
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:10.500]   property organization, the United Nations WIPO, to create this, it was being sent from
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.820]   country to country without discussion in secret and had it not been uncovered by Michael Geist
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:22.260]   in Toronto, or actually I guess he's up in Waterloo, Ottawa.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.420]   Had it not been uncovered by Michael Geist, we may never have known that this was going
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.140]   on.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:36.740]   It's coming from us, so it seems not inappropriate for the G8, for people like us to come and
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.100]   say, "Hey, stop it."
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.620]   And the thing is, sorry Patrick.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:49.620]   The thing is, to us, these things seem monstrous and asinine as they relate to the Internet
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:55.100]   and the way it functions, but these people who are deciding all of this don't even, don't
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:01.380]   see it, don't understand, it's like trying to explain what sight is to a blind person.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.420]   It's very difficult to make them understand what that is and why it is bad.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.500]   So that's why we need to go there and explain to them and shout at them, partly in the way
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.660]   that Jeff did, and tell them, "Stop, you're being insane in this.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.660]   They don't see it that way."
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.340]   On what would you have preferred to see?
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:25.700]   Well, I would have preferred to have a long discourse on this and long conversation, which
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:32.660]   is not, not posturing in public at least or in one-on-one conversations with people who
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.940]   actually can make a difference and not just a few people, but a more wider group.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.900]   See, what is IP in one country is not the country.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:51.020]   What is the unlimited bandwidth in one country is not necessarily the economics in another
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.020]   country.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.940]   So the web and the Internet is changing itself.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:00.020]   And I think the bigger picture, when you look at all this, I think the big picture, which
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:07.140]   we frame things in aspect of just certain specific issues.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.700]   Whereas one has to look at this big Internet as a bigger change.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.660]   It's like, what does it really mean?
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:20.020]   So the conversation should have been, if they wanted to talk about it, what is the reality
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.820]   of Internet economy?
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.740]   How does it impact job creation?
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.620]   How does it impact our education system?
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.420]   How does it impact our retail businesses?
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:36.820]   So those are the areas where government has a more tangible role to play.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:43.420]   They need to come up with thought processes around what do taxes look like in an Internet
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.100]   enabled economy?
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.540]   This is not 1995, this is 2010, 2011.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:56.500]   Our economy is now driven by the network, not the other way around.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.380]   Previously, the network was driven by the overall economy.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.740]   Now, it's an entirely different way of thinking about it.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:11.420]   So just to talk about certain intellectual property issues, those are talking about certain
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.620]   specific problems.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.980]   There is a much bigger wide change which is going on.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.420]   And that's where government and lawmakers have a role to play.
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:27.060]   And I think that's one thing I didn't hear from this conference.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.820]   So that's one thing I would love to see.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.820]   I think-
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.820]   Go ahead, Emma.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.980]   I was just going to say, just speaking as a Canadian, I think on the positive side, I
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.500]   really applaud this actually happening because I think it opens up dialogue.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.020]   And that's something we always fight for on the Internet as we want to be heard.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.380]   And I know in Canada, for example, there is no way Stephen Harper, who is our Prime
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.580]   Minister, would ever invite a group of people who were technical to a meeting with him and
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.580]   his government.
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.260]   It would never happen in an open form or an open environment.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.060]   So in some ways, I think France is ahead of the game with that.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.220]   Whatever Succosie's agenda was.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.220]   Yes, exactly.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.460]   And you also have to- Sorry, I'm interrupting everyone.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.820]   The delay is not kind to me.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:16.460]   The way I saw that event is a little bit of a networking event and it's to get people
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.540]   to know each other.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:23.940]   And maybe at this point, the people who are writing the laws are asking the IP holders
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.260]   what they should do.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:31.980]   But maybe in six months or a year, they'll ask Jeff Jarvis or JP Barlow.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.780]   They'll get to know them and maybe I'm having my rose-
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.780]   Come on.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.780]   Rosemary Busses.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:44.500]   No, but how could they even have known that these issues were issues?
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.020]   They live in a different world.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.020]   That's the question.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.780]   And I think that what I'm saying is they didn't care.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.660]   It wasn't- They weren't even interested in that.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.260]   This was a dog and pony show.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.100]   And I have to say, I have a feeling that no matter what you say to Nicholas Succosie
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.460]   about this, you're not going to change his mind, Patrick.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.580]   Not his mind, but it's not like he is the one writing the laws.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.740]   Well, it was interesting because President Obama did not even want the internet on the
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.580]   agenda at G8.
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.980]   And this was something that Sarkozy kind of bulldozed through.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:24.420]   I think Obama quite reasonably thought this is probably not- Maybe I don't know, maybe
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.060]   he even agrees with Om that this is not an appropriate conversation for that particular
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.060]   group.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.740]   Certainly he did not want to get in the business of regulating the internet.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.140]   That's such a thorny subject.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.620]   And there are bigger issues.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.820]   Well, bigger issues maybe.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.100]   But first of all, if we don't talk about it, we get ACTA.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:48.140]   Second of all, with that event, if nothing else, we got Jeff in front of many cameras
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.140]   around the world.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.140]   Yeah, he'll never be invited back.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.140]   I can guarantee you.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.140]   Come on, maybe.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.140]   I don't know.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.140]   But he's the president now.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.140]   I was thrilled.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:00.460]   I was interested in- Jeff really did exactly what I was hoping he would do.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.060]   He did a great job.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.660]   And I kind of took the easy way out.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.540]   I did have a family emergency, but it made it convenient for me to kind of avoid the
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.780]   conversation entirely.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.020]   I really was looking forward to going.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.460]   But I was shaken by people like Corey and Om's criticism of the event.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.580]   And I just don't know.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.660]   I mean, I feel on the one hand it's good to have these conversations.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.820]   Look at all the conversation that's gone on because of this.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.500]   I don't think you're going to educate the world leaders at a forum like this.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.540]   But at least the conversation is going on.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:40.700]   I guess what you're saying Om is that it's a false premise that this could even be discussed
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.180]   at this kind of event.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.380]   Leo, you've been around long enough just like Lee.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:51.260]   When we had the last time technology was hip and cool, all the politicians were all
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:57.060]   talking about, you know, internet and new laws and youth ways of thinking about it.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:03.540]   And the minute economy took a little nosedive and everybody just vanished into it's in there.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:11.900]   And I kind of, you know, maybe I'm a little cynical and skeptical, but I don't see this
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:21.100]   needs a lot more thoughtful, you know, engagement than just a quick media show.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.100]   I agree.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.100]   I agree.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.780]   Oh, I agree on that too.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.820]   But I guess my question is to both of you, what's the harm?
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:33.700]   You know, worst case scenario, things don't change that we keep on the road to octa.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.380]   Best case scenario, we get a little bit more publicity.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.380]   What's the harm, Om?
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.220]   What's the harm of doing this?
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.860]   I didn't say there was any harm in doing this.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.780]   So I personally opted out of it.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.180]   I didn't say you should go or Patrick should go.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.180]   Right.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.740]   I have a very, you know, I don't have, you know, those colored glasses in my, you know,
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.100]   so I don't dare to us.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.220]   I believe I have hope.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.420]   I hope we can change this.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.980]   I've seen this movie before.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.980]   So that's how.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:06.460]   And by the way, I agree 100% with you that the internet is good for business.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:14.860]   The real issue is that the kind of existing stakeholders want an end to competition,
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.340]   want an end to a free internet because they got it and they want to hold onto it.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:24.460]   And I include Google and Facebook and Apple and all the current stakeholders in this.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.620]   But really the future, and this is, I guess, the argument is that a free and open internet
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.220]   is good for the future.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.060]   It's good for businesses of the future.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.140]   You don't get another Google unless you have a free and open internet.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.780]   And that's how we make sure that we continue to progress and continue to innovate.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.340]   But I think that that's an important argument.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:48.260]   I think that the problem was that the people who were at this event were, for the most
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:55.300]   part, current stakeholders who had an interest in the status quo and that who needed to be
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:01.180]   represented was my kids and our kids' kids, the future, who have an even bigger stake
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.380]   in the free and open internet.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:09.260]   You know, Sarkozy talked about a civilized internet, which kind of curiously is exactly
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.180]   the phrase that the Chinese government uses.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.780]   I don't think you can civilize the internet.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.420]   I think that's a mistaken, even understanding what the internet is.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.020]   Clearly, that's my point.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.220]   That just says everything about the whole event.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   Civilized internet.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:31.180]   I mean, that's presumptuous to say that internet is not civilized.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.980]   There is parts of Paris where you can go and they are not very civilized.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.980]   That's true.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.140]   I think, come on.
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:45.860]   I think this is where there are a lot of people in France.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:55.100]   I think I have a lot of admiration for people who have been championing broadband and wireless
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.500]   internet neutrality in France.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:04.300]   And yet, Sarkozy and Orange are so close.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.180]   And Orange is not being the friend of the internet, so to speak.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:16.300]   Unless there was a company called Free, they would have not even offered to fiber and high
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.900]   speed internet access and wipe services to their customers.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.060]   And they could have just kept on going charging more money.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:30.940]   So if you're talking about a civilized internet, let's just define what is internet according
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.940]   to you.
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:39.660]   I don't want to go into a political discussion here, but this was a lot for me personally
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.660]   to other people.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:41.860]   It may seem like a great thing.
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:47.260]   To me, it was nothing more than just a way to get cheap media points.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.260]   And they did.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.420]   Hey, because your microphone is on your collar right there, it's rattling a little bit against
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.420]   your mic collar.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.860]   I don't know exactly what we can do except in case it in rubber or something.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.740]   Do you guys realize that if my internet service provider, Rogers is listening right now,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.540]   I may start getting cut off.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.540]   Yeah, they don't like it.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.140]   Every time we talk about this stuff, Amber loses her bandwidth.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.140]   And I think my bandwidth right now, I only have Twitter blains.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.700]   I have to say, Rogers is notoriously bad when it comes to two.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.620]   The situation in Canada is really bad.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.060]   You know, talking about the government being in bed with big business, particularly with
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.980]   the telcos, we don't necessarily have a very bright future here with the internet.
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.740]   There's a couple of options as far as providers, not a whole lot of conversation.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.820]   However, we do have champions out there.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.180]   Leo mentioned Michael Geist.
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.940]   And I recommend people check out his blog because he really is fighting for more open
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.260]   internet and a real great person to follow on that front.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.940]   I was reading a giga home today.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:49.340]   The great article about the Chattanooga internet, the gigabit that the Chattanooga Power Company
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:55.340]   was providing, was basically a civil internet, not a civilized internet.
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.060]   And what a success that's been for Chattanooga.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.620]   And more and more, I really think that this is the future of the internet is to have municipalities
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.580]   provide the kind of infrastructure.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.060]   And then I have a lot of competing ISPs on top of it.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.100]   And I think when I mention this, a lot of people think I'm nuts, that there's no way
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.340]   that that's going to happen.
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.060]   But it's working in Chattanooga.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.060]   That's a great article.
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:20.540]   And people should read that if they want to see what the potential is for an amazing success
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.540]   story.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.140]   Gigabitty and good for business.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.140]   Really good for business.
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.100]   We're going to take a break.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:34.980]   Oh, Malek is here from giga ohm and his new newsletter Ohm says more signal, less noise,
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:40.460]   Amber MacArthur, my old buddy from the social hour and CP 24.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:47.580]   And of course, the great command and TV and Patrick Bejah, not Patrick on Twitter, who
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.500]   for some reason I don't fully understand as a whole bunch of English language podcasts.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.500]   Are you?
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.500]   Are you nuts?
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.100]   What are you nuts?
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.340]   And is regular makes a regular appearance on TNT.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.940]   But you got the move a little bit move a little bit.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.420]   The Philly is club one day I'm going to be on that show.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.420]   I hope so.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.420]   It's kind of Twitter.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.020]   It's a national Twitter is the idea behind that.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:17.740]   Yeah, a Twitter for international news where we get people from different countries and
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.740]   cultures.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:26.220]   And just this weekend we had someone from Saudi Arabia, Australia, France and the US discussing
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.940]   Ben Ladin's death and Dominique Strzoscan scandal.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.940]   Very interesting.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.180]   Yeah, that was that was an interesting time.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:41.260]   I think there was more attention paid to that the scandal, the IMF Chairman scandal than
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.700]   there was to the G.A.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.380]   Or even the G.A.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.180]   You know, I misspoke as a G.A.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.180]   It's over.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.180]   I didn't even.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.180]   Yeah.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.900]   There was hardly any there were EGA got more ink than the G.A.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.180]   There's hardly anything that was my impression to yeah.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.180]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.180]   Oddly enough.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.180]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.820]   You know it's good to present it to the G.A.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.460]   I didn't see how that went.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.460]   Mark likes to kill his own meat.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.380]   We're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.540]   Can I just conclude on that E.G.A. thing?
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.540]   Yes.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.300]   Just to get us all in agreement at least to try.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:21.700]   I guess the thing that we should try to get is to put the internet issues and the technology
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:27.780]   issues on the to have them become electoral issues.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:33.980]   And maybe that event makes enough noise that maybe people outside of the tech community
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.800]   are going to start paying attention and respond in case they get that you know issues put
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.600]   forth to them.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.740]   Well I think you make a good point.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.820]   I don't think I think that's the real problem is that while we geeks know about these issues
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:52.300]   and care about them, nobody else does and the mass of voters have no idea that there
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:57.300]   is an issue about about you know that there's a threat to a free and open internet.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.300]   They have no idea.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.420]   It's really hard to get them to care though.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.260]   I know I've been involved in sort of net neutrality campaigns in Canada for a long time
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.020]   and it's really hard to get the mainstream population to care.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.100]   I mean as long as they understand it, they can understand it.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.980]   It's the most even net neutrality does a disservice to the whole reason you know people
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.140]   who care about net neutrality.
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.940]   The term is just awful and it's hard to explain to you know the general media and the mainstream
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.220]   population as well.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.740]   That's the fear that they just don't care.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.020]   The thing that I worry about is this just mass apathy about the whole thing and it's
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.500]   very hard to get people excited about it.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.820]   The young people who care are geeks.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.380]   Yeah there's apathy about people you know in terms of voting for the leader of the country
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.180]   so I mean when you try to get them to care about the internet, I don't know where you're
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.180]   left.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.180]   I don't care about war in the Middle East, let alone the internet.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.740]   We just had a federal election and again you know one of the all time close to it and
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.860]   all time low as far as voter turnout and you try to get push the internet in there and
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.060]   I mean it's a whole world of apathy.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.060]   Right.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.940]   We're going to take a break, come back with more with our esteemed panel, our international
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.580]   panel for our Memorial Day show but before we go any further I'd like to talk a little
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:05.100]   bit about one of our esteemed sponsors, the great folks at Citrix who do go to meeting,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:10.140]   go to meeting is an online meeting system that just you probably tried these before.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.500]   It is the best.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:16.860]   It allows you to meet easily with colleagues, clients even if you're traveling or moving
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.540]   around especially because they've got that great iPad app.
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.020]   Now you can go to meetings with your iPad and I love that.
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.180]   I want you to try it right now, Mac or PC.

[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.300]   got a great invitation system.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:51.500]   It includes built in free telephony voice over internet or telephone so that the conference
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.380]   bridge and everything is automatically set up.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.300]   In fact these days we use going to meeting even when we just want to do a teleconference
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.860]   because you never know you might want to show the screen and it makes it so easy to
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.220]   set it up and we've already paid for it.

[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.820]   that's absolutely free.

[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.940]   whether it's colleagues, whether it's new prospects that you want to pitch there's nothing
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.940]   better.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:30.700]   Go to meeting.com use the offer code TWIT.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:35.300]   We'll go from a heavy subject to a light subject but it'll get us into the Facebook
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.420]   and there's quite a bit to say about Facebook.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:43.840]   I think this is just weird according to fortune.cnn.com Mark Zuckerberg now no longer eats anything
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.840]   he doesn't kill.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.660]   Oh you're probably a vegetarian so this would be easy for you.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.660]   Oops, let me turn you out.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.140]   Say again I'm sorry.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:55.340]   I said I don't kill by meat.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:01.080]   Simple reason you know there's been a reason you know we've evolved and just live in the
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.980]   cities and have some good pictures.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.660]   But don't you feel disconnected from me?
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.900]   I don't.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.900]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.300]   This is so weird.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.400]   He says the only meat I'm eating is from animals I've killed myself.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.880]   I'm eating a lot healthier foods and I've learned a lot about sustainable farming you
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   have to say that.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:27.440]   I kind of admire the moral point of view that well I'm not going to eat it unless I look
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.880]   at in the eyes.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:38.840]   He says on his Facebook page he says I just killed a pig in a goat.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.080]   He says he it's just very strange.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.300]   Every year he fixates on a personal challenge for instance I didn't know this.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.160]   In 2009 he wore a necktie every day.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.120]   He learned Chinese last year too.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:56.560]   Last year year in Chinese this year he's killing pigs.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.440]   It's so strange what I wonder about this whole story is how does Mark Zuckerberg have
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.720]   time to go out and kill his own meat.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.400]   I mean when there are people out there especially with young people and there's all these privacy
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.640]   issues and there are issues with Facebook in general as far as people you know I don't
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.040]   know if it's jeopardizing kids futures but I know a lot of young people who are writing
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.760]   things on there who shouldn't be writing them they don't understand the settings that
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.280]   navigation is terrible and all I kept thinking when he actually has time to go out and kill
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.280]   a goat in a pig.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.400]   Shouldn't he be focusing on privacy?
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   Really?
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.800]   Very good point.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:31.560]   Oh come on even presidents have time to you know relax and I don't know go to if they
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.560]   want to.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.000]   They have even more responsibilities.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.960]   To actually go out and like it takes a lot of time to go out and find a pig to kill in
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.880]   a suitable environment kill the pig take it back take it to a butcher.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.760]   I mean that's a long process.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.640]   He started with golfing.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.920]   He started with instead of golf.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.440]   He started with a lobster.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.440]   He started with sea creatures.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.440]   He says the lobster was a difficult kill at least emotionally.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.480]   He cooked it live.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.720]   He says the most interesting thing was how special it felt to eat it.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.600]   I'm sorry I can't go on.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.560]   It's pretty easy to make fun of this but honestly why not?
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:14.040]   I mean trying to live from it's you never see where what you eat comes from.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.560]   I do admire that.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:23.000]   It's and also it's so fun to have a tech billionaire be eccentric.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Maybe he can be some sort of Howard Hughes or something.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   That's very good.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   I don't know though.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.440]   I think I kind of liked it and part in the pun before Zuckerberg came out of his shell.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.920]   And the reason I say that is seriously you know the social network the movie movie before
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   that movie came out.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.120]   He never heard anything about his personal life and now he's sharing pictures on Facebook
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.440]   talking about what he eats his hobbies his past time.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.440]   I don't know.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440]   Well that's a good point.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.440]   He has come out of his shell.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.040]   Now we know way too much about him.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.400]   You know too much.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.080]   And he is very eccentric and I applaud the idea of killing you on meat and everything
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.400]   but I just think you know in his role and I just wonder personally just how he has time
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.880]   to do it but also I just think gosh why you know what has prompted him to kind of is he
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.440]   enjoying this celebrity a little bit.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.880]   He's just getting weirder and weirder.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:09.000]   Now he said something a couple of days ago that actually got got my dander up.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   He said privacy anxiety.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.360]   He said you'll get over it.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.360]   No big deal.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.640]   What are you so worried about?
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:21.480]   He says every time we this was he was speaking at the EGA by the way.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.800]   He says we'll roll it out and pretty often they'll be this backlash and people will
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.640]   say okay we don't like this new thing.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:35.280]   I think a real anxiety people were really afraid of more people being able to be involved
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.680]   in the social network.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.760]   This guy completely doesn't understand what we're upset about.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.320]   People thought that you know it was just too much right.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.520]   They wanted to share stuff on the site but they didn't want it to be so much of people's
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.920]   face.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.760]   You know now it's just part of the site that I think most people in the way would be like
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.560]   what's going on how can there be a Facebook without this.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.160]   He says it's just anxiety.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.640]   You'll get over it.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.400]   What are you so worried about?
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.400]   That's very self-serving.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.920]   Here's a guy who's got a problem if you ask me.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.480]   Yeah I would agree with you.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.240]   I mean tell them to friend you know I have family members who are teens who you know some
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.640]   of the things that they're sharing openly on Facebook they don't understand how to control
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.640]   any of the settings.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.920]   They're sharing their phone number their home address and I sure it's a parental issue
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.400]   as far as monitoring what their kids are doing but the parents and the teachers don't
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.720]   understand the privacy settings either within Facebook.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.960]   So it's an issue where I think Facebook hasn't taken enough responsibility and when he says
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.440]   things like that just kind of in stride I mean it just downplays what I think is a really
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.760]   serious issue about the future of kids and using these sites.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.400]   It really comes from maybe you don't know better home because you know this guy but
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.880]   it really comes from to me a complete misunderstanding of how people feel about privacy.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.480]   He's essentially saying no you really want he said he said this before people's lives
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.160]   are better when we're connected.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.360]   All of this stuff about privacy you should let go of that.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:58.040]   It just happens it's very self-serving because his business the more we allow him to share
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:04.160]   the more money he makes but I think he genuinely believes that privacy is a dumb thing except
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.880]   I don't know maybe when it comes to himself.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:18.120]   I think there's one issue and I'm not trying to defend Mark here but I do feel that the
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:24.920]   next generation of users think very differently about privacy and how they use the internet
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:33.520]   whereas some of us who are a little older or even you know not as old as me for instance
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:40.480]   who don't you are uncomfortable with the you know lack of privacy so to speak on many
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.280]   of these social networks and I think that is we can't ignore that fact.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:51.920]   I think that is a legitimate issue out there and you know as far as you know the way I
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:59.520]   look at privacy is that you kind of you kind of have to make choices on like what you say
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:06.920]   and what you don't say in public and I think that all of that is going to come from education
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   and education you know that comes with using the internet not some go you know our schools
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:20.920]   teaching our parents telling us what to do as kids so I think that there is a the technology
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.560]   culture itself is lagging the technology in that sense.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:31.720]   Dana Boyd has said that she studies young people and you know is says that the young
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:37.800]   people treat privacy differently that we believe that privacy is a default so we're upset
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   when it when it fails us and that young people understand that you have to you actually have
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:48.040]   to say I want it to be private otherwise it's not but she also says privacy is maybe not
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:57.760]   the right phrase for this she says we want control over the flow of information understanding
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:04.480]   where what we say goes and controlling who gets to see it I guess that's that's how I
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.720]   understand privacy but.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.960]   Well I think you also that's that's not.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.520]   Oh sorry go ahead Patrick.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.520]   No please do.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.840]   I was just going to say that term digital reputation management is being tossed around everywhere
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.000]   and you know maybe that's a better phrase to use and as much as I agree with on in terms
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.800]   of people younger generation caring less about privacy the issue is they're still coming
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.000]   into a workforce where the people who are hiring them care about them sharing things
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.280]   online and they're getting scholarships where they're you're getting these scholarships
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.360]   are winning these scholars scholarships from schools that are looking at all their online
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:39.240]   profiles and you know it's going to be a while before that really young generation who
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.000]   doesn't care as much about privacy you know gets into positions where it's going to equal
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   things out.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.800]   I confess I'm the wrong guy to talk about this because I apparently have no.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.400]   I have no sense.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:56.720]   No no filter at all I have no boundaries at all so I you know I don't I don't live very
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.920]   I live very publicly but I see how people this upsets people and I feel like that Facebook
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:09.080]   is a little disingenuous to you use your word Patrick about what they're up to.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.640]   They act as if well you'll you'll want this when in fact really wants this is Facebook.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.920]   Well yeah that's that's true of course and I think you all made good points in the fact
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:23.640]   that we absolutely need to know more about what our privacy settings are.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:29.000]   I think people like maybe us just assume that anything we put out there on Facebook be it
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.280]   private or public is should be considered okay if in case it ever leaks.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   Right.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.560]   I'm just careful I think I took a line from your book there Leo.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:45.640]   But just to be fair to poor Mark who we're ganging up on today.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:50.800]   I think what one thing he was mentioning with where he has a case is the fact that whenever
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:55.200]   he puts up a new feature and that's true of everything on the internet whenever you
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:01.040]   anything changes people are going to be pissed off and everyone was threatening to quit
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.840]   Facebook I'm looking at you Leo yeah I quit you know and yeah you did but you came back
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:12.480]   and all these issues are not exactly but I'm not happy about it but I just you you have
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.240]   to you can't be on that this is one of the things I hate about Facebook.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.600]   Well if you really if you really okay let's let's put your case aside because it's sort
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:28.240]   of a special case but a lot of people were unhappy were expressing their anger very very
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.560]   vocally and in the end that anger sort of fell back and and no one is incredibly upset
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.320]   about some of the features that Zuckerberg has I think that's only because I think that's
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.800]   only because we just gave up.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.000]   Not things like not things like the the feed he was mentioning in his speech when the feed
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.880]   just arrived I think it was 2006 or seven very early in the life of Facebook people
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.200]   were in uproar you know it's that thing of of changing a feature or piece.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   So the interfaith is.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.400]   No I agree I know what you're saying and I agree with that in the sense that but I think
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:10.040]   he's conflating two different kinds of anger there is when anything changes if I changed
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:14.520]   you know the the backdrop behind me people are going to be upset oh you're changing
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.200]   ruin it you you've jumped the shark that's one kind of upset and I understand that people
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.520]   don't like change and they get upset and then they get used to it but he's conflating
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:28.840]   that with I think the very real and legitimate concerns people have about Facebook's changing
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:35.320]   privacy policy and how hard it is to figure out what the hell is going on there you know
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.720]   you know you know from one moment to the next you don't know what is going to happen to
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.280]   stuff you post there and you're right Patrick the right assumption is just assume it's going
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.920]   to go public but that's not the problem they're making.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.480]   I agree but I think he's doing that absolutely and it's absolutely because that's what failure
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   is going to be.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   It's convenient.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.680]   Yeah no completely but I also think that we are doing that a little bit too in saying
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.320]   that users are still completely upset about every one of those new features that they
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:10.080]   were upset about when they were introduced things like you know tagging the tagging someone
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.160]   else on the photo people realized okay it's no big deal if I don't like it then I delete
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:21.720]   it or you know these kinds of little things the general privacy setting is an understand
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:28.000]   standability of the privacy settings is a huge problem I agree but not everything is
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.160]   to that level of you know DEFCON 5.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.440]   But it's not it's not just privacy on Facebook I would argue just from someone who runs a
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.360]   business I make living by doing social media and consulting clients and the reality is
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.560]   they change so many other things on Facebook on a weekly basis like if you want to have
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.960]   a contest on on Facebook every week they change the rules and regulations and I just get this
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.440]   feeling I don't know Mark I don't know who he works with at that top level that these
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.080]   are a bunch of young people are just like I will change it this week see what happens
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:00.360]   I think that's the culture and it's an arrogance and it feels like it's a lack of respect for
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.520]   users out there who depend on the service to connect with friends and family to do business
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.560]   and they just are you know switching things up kind of you know half hazard Lee that's
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.400]   my opinion is this the is this the generation gap you were talking about home is it a bunch
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:18.800]   of young people at Facebook who don't get the concerns that the us older people have I
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:24.880]   don't know if it's the people at Facebook who are like that I think but they have a culture
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:31.160]   of crying a lot of new things and you know what I've seen is that you know Facebook as
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:39.040]   a company you know pushes to the very extreme to the very edge and sees how far it can push
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:44.160]   its customer base and then when there is a pushback so they pull it back yeah and then
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:50.360]   they do it again and so they've you know they've you know they've won you know that movie
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:56.240]   any given Sunday football is a game of inches I think Facebook is it up Facebook has adopted
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:02.160]   that philosophy when it comes to privacy and changes I would say one thing about Facebook
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.480]   at least they don't put do no evil in their heart.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:13.800]   Do you think these at Google is as bad as Facebook.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:19.920]   I mean these are big companies which have to make money and they have their own agenda
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.000]   I mean we have to be naive to believe that these companies don't have their own agenda
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.680]   right like so whether it's Facebook Twitter Google you know they're in the business of
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:35.120]   making money and there is this whole idea of them doing the right thing well I don't
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.280]   know you know let's I don't want to be don't want to sound too skeptical and too cynical
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:45.880]   about everything but that's how you know life normally works out it just companies make
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:51.200]   money and they'll do anything in order to further their own interests and so that's
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.920]   okay you know we need to be just aware of that basic reality.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:03.520]   Although I think you can look at how the companies make money to understand better what their
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:10.560]   agenda is I mean Facebook makes money both Facebook and Google make money through ads
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:18.080]   but Facebook makes money by using the information you give it to allow advertisers to target
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:23.920]   those ads and sometimes very personal information and Google makes money by taking money from
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:30.880]   people who sell fake pharmaceuticals and they're in a little trouble for that aren't they and
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:37.240]   run infant infanticide infrinside ads in countries like India so come on I mean it's
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.240]   like we start looking at everything we all live in the glass house.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.400]   Yeah I guess that's true I guess that's true.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:52.720]   Dick Costolo is going to be working for the president apparently the CEO of Twitter will
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:50:00.760]   be named to an advisory committee to President Obama according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.240]   Among others.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.040]   See that's something we don't have in France.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.240]   Well you guys have a...
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.480]   We may have it I don't know if it means anything.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.960]   Oh it means that the government is paying attention to the technology world and you
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:23.640]   have you know a CTO and we don't have anything like that maybe if we have you know if we
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:28.120]   had a CEO of some tech company and more involved in the government we wouldn't have had the
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:34.960]   Street three strikes law or it's the president's national security telecommunications advisory
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:43.100]   committee or NS Tech and along with Dick Costolo will be Scott Charny from Microsoft Jamie
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:48.760]   Dose Santos who's the CEO of a company called TerraMark Federal Group David Dewalt president
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:54.840]   of Intel oh no I'm sorry president of Intel's McAfee division I forgot Intel bought McAfee
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:51:00.000]   and Lisa Hook CEO of NewStar I don't know I mean I don't know I don't have any experience
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   with these committees I don't know how often they sit how many recommendations they make
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.640]   and most importantly whether anybody pays any attention at all to what they say is it a
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:17.920]   cinecure is it or is it a real job I don't know I think there's no doubt though that Obama
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:22.360]   obviously recognizes that it's important to have companies like Twitter and Google and
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.440]   think about those companies and their leaders and have them involved in discussions about
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.120]   the future of the US and so I think I fall into Patrick's camp here in the sense that
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:36.440]   it would be great to see my government in Canada Stephen Harper honestly I don't want
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:41.120]   to see he's one of the most evil leaders in the G8 but if you look up what Stephen Harper
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.920]   is open about sharing and how he does business he is kind of locked down information in this
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:51.760]   company or in this country in a way that we've never experienced before and you know he's
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.200]   you know we've been kicked off the security council so I would need I say more so he will
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   not be involving anyone from an open technology platform in an advisory role I highly doubt
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:09.720]   it's Twitter is also in the news because they've furnished information to the British government
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:16.840]   a British court the name email address and telephone number of a south tineside counselor
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:23.600]   accused of libeling the local authority via a series of anonymous Twitter accounts South
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:29.080]   Tineside Council took the legal fight to the Superior Court of California which ordered
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:36.400]   Twitter to hand over the private details so is that the first time this has happened
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.040]   Leo that's it's supposedly the first time Twitter is bowed illegal pressure to identify
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:46.640]   anonymous users now I have to say I have some experience with this we had I don't know how
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:54.840]   much I want to say about this there was a tweet that was problematic and we got a subpoena
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:59.240]   and we were able to track down the person who did the tweet but it took court orders
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:04.600]   several court orders to do it it was a threatening tweet and we want to make sure that wasn't
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:11.440]   a real threat not to myself but to somebody else and we had the local police and then
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.280]   had to subpoena we it was a number of processes we had to go through it's not an easy thing
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:19.000]   to do but and Twitter doesn't give you that information only give you as an IP address
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.880]   then you have to go to the internet service provider and from them you get the the person's
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:32.640]   name but we were able to do that Ryan Giggs who is a soccer player for Manchester United
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.800]   was named as the plaintiff in a gag order preventing reporting of an alleged affair with
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:42.120]   a reality TV model he's trying he's trying to get the names of Twitter users accused
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:50.360]   of revealing details against the injunction and it was retweeted by like 33 thousand
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.400]   problem users yeah and we won't scare the names of all of them that's not just the one
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:54:02.840]   yeah that's what I heard good luck what's he gonna do I'm kidding but Twitter no I think
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.400]   Twitter says this that if provided with a court order you know we'll give you the information
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:14.200]   we know yeah and in this case they actually informed the guy I'm sorry the the case before
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:22.040]   apparently they informed the guy and he declined to contest the subpoena which is why they ended
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:29.080]   up interesting releasing his information so it's not as big as we all thought it was when
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:36.360]   the first the story first break had he fought it and and and then there's wiener gate hilarious
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:41.160]   that's a sound I don't want to believe on this one but New York Democratic representative
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:49.080]   Anthony Wiener's Twitter account Friday night featured a photo of a man in underwear with
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:56.240]   a quite a bulge apparently the tweet was an at reply to a Washington state woman of course
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:09.040]   the tweet was retweeted quite a bit he says he was hacked yeah sure I do love his response
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:16.960]   though I have to say it is classic he deleted the lewd tweet and then tweeted Tivo shot
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.680]   because I guess his Tivo didn't he had tweeted that his Tivo hadn't recorded a hockey game
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:27.200]   Tivo shot Facebook hacked is my blender gonna attack me next and then use the hashtag the
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:33.320]   toaster is very loyal at least he has a sense of humor about this this is a similar situation
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:38.440]   happened with a really well-known TV personality here in Canada where he tweeted something that
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.600]   was obviously supposed to be a DM to someone he people think he was potentially having an
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:46.840]   affair with it was very embarrassing and he said my Twitter account was hacked and you know
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:52.080]   that I think the good news is people learn very quickly about the difference between a DM
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:56.520]   and a reply yeah I think that's what happened I think he didn't understand the difference
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:08.040]   between a DM and a reply the woman deleted her account immediately however bloggers located
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.640]   her and identified her Twitter handle and found a second account she's believed to be
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:17.440]   a journalism student in Washington state and apparently in the original account she had
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:24.120]   tweeted I wonder what my boyfriend at rep wiener is up to right now of course that's
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:31.400]   why she got a picture of his crotch or somebody's crotch we don't know I have to say though
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:36.680]   that that picture is incredibly disappointing I didn't see it I you actually sought it out
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:42.920]   a Patrick well it's on it's in the article that is it oh I think so oh yeah you're right
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:50.600]   see the great thing about it's not impressive yeah I think the great thing about Twitter
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:58.200]   is that we can all be stupid and incredibly idiotic at a global scale in the whole world
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:05.160]   see yeah so dear I think every you hit the no one's gonna care are they well this is
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:11.120]   a good yeah well he I have to say though he I mean his response and the fact that with
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.120]   humor if he just said nothing and closed down his Twitter account this would have been a
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:18.800]   very different situation so I think he kind of alleviated some of the drama by just responding
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.760]   being kind of funny and using a quirky hashtag he kind of in some ways even though obviously
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.680]   he doesn't totally understand how to use Twitter if he did publicly do this he understands
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:32.160]   that you know it's it's important to reply quickly and to use some humor as well I believe
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:39.400]   this is the advice Amber gives in power yes you must have read your book use a clever
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:47.160]   hashtag when caught red handed that's the next book alright use a clever hashtag I
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.920]   know you're a big fan of Jacob Nielsen the user user interface guy the usability guy he's
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:58.120]   just in a study of iPad apps which we're going to talk about in a bit and Samsung's lawyers
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:03.360]   get a little uppity in their lawsuit with Apple we'll talk about that in just a second
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.760]   before we do though I'd like to mention our friends at Ford sponsors of our photo show

[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:25.100]   o Malek and Patrick Bezia our international crew well all but all but you and me so there
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:30.860]   is a there's a little lawsuit going on Samsung and Apple Apple says Samsung stole everything
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:36.840]   from the iPhone in the iPad Samsung countersuit and now I love this I don't know if this is
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:45.840]   going to succeed Samsung's lawyers have asked in discovery that Apple send them the iPhone
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:56.040]   five in the iPad three just so you know they can take a look and this is this is just like
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:03.760]   this is are they serious or is this just like mean or mean or mean or well Apple got the
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:09.720]   right to see the Samsung prototypes they ask for the droid charge yes yeah the droid charge
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:16.920]   the infused 4g the galaxy s2 and the new galaxy tab so quote Apple could determine if these
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:23.960]   products could be part of the lawsuit so Samsung said okay okay well we want to see the iPhone
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   five I love it when you can't compete litigate they'll get it but it will come attached to
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:45.600]   Steve Jobs's arm with a bracelet the court sided with Apple because review units had come
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.200]   out of most of these in photos and so forth so it wasn't it wasn't giving up anything that
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:57.280]   people hadn't already seen but but I'll be very curious to see if if they if they if they say
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   to Apple you better if they do then they're clearly not paying attention see they say by
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:15.840]   June 13th it's be good for the Apple room or website yeah gizmo is gonna love this yeah
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:21.240]   yeah through fun they say final versions aren't available by June 13th we'll take the most
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:30.320]   current version I bet they will this is great this is great I just this is a this lawsuit
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.000]   is going to go on for years and give us lots of material it's like the Winklevoss twins
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.520]   yeah going to the Supreme Court now living right up to live in right up to that those
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:45.800]   characters that were created for them in the the movie social network they're exactly like
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:52.960]   that apparently so I have a question about all these these lawsuits from seem from here
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.520]   from France it seems like every other day you have a new one and it's they're all more
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:03.040]   ridiculous than the other and it's just a game of lawsuits and problem is we have a
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:09.960]   very broken patent and system in this country right but it does it mean that they're all
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:20.920]   ludicrous or are some of them actually valid I don't know all what do you think you know
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:25.560]   there's so many of these you can't tell which ones are valid and which ones are not valid
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:32.760]   I do think the there is a this one between Samsung and Apple might actually have some
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:40.320]   legs and Samsung stole Apple's trade dress no but there is like this one might actually
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:46.120]   end up in some kind of out of code settlement between the two companies I mean it seems
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:51.880]   there is enough on both sides to to kind of have to deal with it in a more effective
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:59.640]   way than just like you had the the lawsuits between Nokia and Qualcomm and those resulted
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.560]   in settlements so there may be some stuff which might happen on this one but otherwise
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.960]   I just see like a lot of the other ones that are you know I can't even tell I actually
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:18.480]   start trying to figure out I guess my general feeling is even if there's merit just stay
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.040]   out of court just been all that energy and money and time yeah exactly make better products
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.000]   I agree that seems to me a better use of your time yeah too much your friends your
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   friend jay is in the company well that's promised that Apple has a building full of
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.640]   lawyers they got to do something your friend Jacob Nielsen amber the Nielsen Norman group
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:50.440]   just did a comprehensive study of apps on the iPad they gave 16 study participants access
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:58.480]   to the NPR app flip board the daily and the Amazon app among others to see if they could
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:05.400]   figure out how to use it they had two months with these apps and according to the Nielsen
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:12.160]   group people have no clue how do you use iPad apps you know that this story kind of drives
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.480]   me crazy I do you're right I do love Jacob Nielsen I followed him forever in his usability
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:22.160]   studies but can you really call 16 people a comprehensive study group I mean when I read
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.320]   that I just had somehow had doubts because I look at my own experience with my son who
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.240]   just turned two years old he can figure it out he knows how he plays Angry Birds he's
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:36.480]   on like level 14 I mean he's two he's two and he knows how to use a people probably uses
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.720]   about six or seven apps right now he's not toilet trained he can use the toilet but he
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:46.120]   can use an iPad yeah and so I'm wondering who are these people who they found because
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.240]   I understand that you know apps obviously there are different apps some are easier some
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.920]   are more difficult but the reality is people choose apps based on their own preferences
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.760]   and hobbies and things that they like and so to just give people a bunch of random apps
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.080]   and say okay start using this and not know enough about the background of these people
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.560]   and their interests and their technological skill set I just think it you know 16 people
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.280]   in a study like this it's a great headline but is it really a well all right this is
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:14.360]   there's some of the things they suggest I have to agree with them in one respect every iPad
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:19.560]   app has a different UI yeah that's true I mean it's because there's no standard at all there's
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:24.480]   no menu bar so all of them you end up and I think this is why little kids are good at
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:30.800]   it trial and error you end up just doing things swipe push poke and when something happens
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.200]   a kid loves it they go oh and and and that's why little kids are better than adults adults
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:42.040]   are saying there's got to be some sense to this you know I think Leo the the the thing
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:48.200]   with iPad and and kids is exactly what I was talking about young people and privacy and
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:55.760]   Facebook is that they have a whole different way of thinking about things touch is a very
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:02.480]   natural interface and they can figure it out very easily especially and it comes to games
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:08.040]   or educational software which prompts them to do things they would have done these things
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:12.920]   in real life I think those are the applications which are being successful I think there is
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.680]   a reason why Angry Birds is so successful there is a proper touch physics behind it you know
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:24.520]   it just didn't happen so they thought this one through that how can anybody use it without
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:30.800]   having a learning curve and I think when you look at something like NPR app that is a brilliant
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.720]   app and anybody can use it I say the same thing about the Amazon app is the same thing
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:42.640]   I would not say the same thing about the other two you mentioned right the daily and and
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:47.840]   flip board there are work in progress just yet and so I think and first of all to say
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:54.800]   that 16 people are a comprehensive study I don't think so if when you think of an iPad
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:00.800]   you have to stop thinking of it from a predictable user experience that you are used to on a
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:07.800]   computer and I think that's where you know all these apps are created and apps are reviewed
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:15.360]   with a PC mindset I think that's exactly what is going on right now there's also a study
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:22.160]   that says French consulting firm Mira Tech so this one's from France Patrick just published
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:28.240]   a research report saying that people reading news on an iPad are skimming and can't remember
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:36.160]   what they read I'm sorry I can't remember what you just said readers are more likely to skim
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.920]   over articles on an iPad and in a newspaper 20% of users have better retention when they
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:46.240]   read something on paper versus an iPad there's no difference in the amount of time it takes
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.000]   a person to read an article on the iPad versus a newspaper so they're not they're not reading
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.120]   it faster they're just remembering less and on average eyes linger longer on paper implying
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.680]   more focused reading people's gaze they did eye tracking on this people's gaze patterns
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.080]   when they look at a page or identical on an iPad versus a print newspaper there's just
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:13.600]   something about it people just aren't remembering it you know I have to say even without going
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.560]   to eye tracking I don't know if you guys are guilty of that too but I've been using on
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:25.560]   the iPad RSS reader application and I found that recently in the last few months when
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:32.120]   I come across a story if I don't get everything I need to know from the headline and I jump
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:37.960]   into the story and it's more than three paragraphs you know paragraphs long I sometimes don't
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:45.320]   even want to read it headline just go you know iPad users are easily bored there you go I'll
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:53.000]   just get my information from you know the either Twitter or podcasts or but if you need
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.080]   to condense it so much for to grab my attention do you guys see that at all or do you still
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:05.480]   read long articles I'm bored let's move on yeah no in fact I think that's why readability
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:12.160]   and insta paper are so great because in fact most of the time when you're doing content
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.680]   consumption on something like an iPad you are skimming but the ability to say save that
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.440]   so that I can read that later I think it's very valuable but you ever go back to that
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:25.600]   Leo because I mean the experience always yeah I never go back to because there's a sense
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.000]   of urgency online you know we want we want information that's new that's fresh and so
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.560]   the idea of going back to news I mean that's how I hate to say this but that's how I feel
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.680]   when I get the newspaper on the doorstep in the morning even though we still get the
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:42.520]   newspaper is like you know 80% of it I kind of already know it's anxiety provoking yeah
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.000]   I get the big New York Times it's like I can't get through that when I get the New Yorker
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.600]   every week it's like can you just send me some headlines and a Twitter feed or something
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.160]   like that tweet me yeah I wait this is terrible but my brother reads the Globe Mail which is
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:01.600]   Canada's National newspaper pretty much from front to back every day and so he reads it
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.240]   online and I'll I'll wait until he kind of tweets the best articles before I even think
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.560]   of diving into the site because I know he'll kind of pick up some of the best stuff so
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:12.320]   you have all these human filters around you right going through that longer content for
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:20.440]   you yeah that's the excuse yeah your brother is your flip board yeah pretty much I'm sure
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:27.440]   you'll love to do this to your brother go fast I could do that to some people actually
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.040]   that are a little wordy because I thought even just in general you know people are taking
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:37.080]   too long to say something you just want to move them on okay I got the message how can
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:47.280]   that you've seen Google's cloud service Amazon did you how many how many of you bought Gaga
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:56.160]   for 99 cents I'm Gaga you got that out yeah oh Malick I know you're a big lady Gaga fan
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:04.280]   I actually I didn't even wait for the 99 cent off I bought it on iTunes so you paid $11.99
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:09.440]   I pay retail you're a terrible consumer why did you do that I couldn't wait I just wanted
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:18.280]   this to have him he is a lady Gaga fan I was joking I am like she's the perfect new media
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:25.800]   star she's brilliant I do I do have to say that she is using new media in in such an impressive
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:31.280]   way you know when I first when you saw that chrome ad right and I watched the chrome the
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.240]   lady Gaga chrome ad and I thought oh well those so superficial her tweets you know
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:40.280]   claws up little monsters stuff like that and then somebody said no read her tweets and
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.480]   she actually engages with her audience she at replies people she's totally in there
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:51.320]   hmm amazing she I mean Amber I'm sure you know she's next book she's gonna be a case study
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:57.400]   and oh she's phenomenal and you know she's met she sent a tweet a while ago that was a
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.680]   kind of inappropriate and she actually apologized for it right away and she's so connected to
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:04.960]   all of her fans I totally agree with that I mean I think that she's done a great job
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.080]   of using a bunch of different channels in the social media world I just find it's one
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:13.200]   of those things it's like Gaga saturation for me it's sort of you know it's too much right
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.440]   let me ask you do you think that's really her tweeting oh I don't know I kind of think
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:24.680]   it is and whoever if it's not her job of being authentic exactly so it feels like her but
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.120]   you know then again you know as far as authenticity I feel like she ripped off Madonna so that's
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:35.400]   a whole other person if Twitter had existed during Madonna's reign watch out watch out
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:43.680]   so there is a on my on my personal blog Ole Miss start me there is a video of this person
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:51.760]   who talks about Gaga ripping off Madonna Madonna ripping off somebody else etcetera the music
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:57.440]   as they say the idea of original music is just going away I think what what Lady Gaga
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:05.520]   has done is establish that the media is a game of attention it doesn't matter what platform
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:11.840]   you use what channel you use what methods you use the more attention you get the more
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:17.480]   you know you know the bigger star you are the bigger star you are the more you can monetize
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:24.440]   it I think she embodies that attention economics better than anybody else her and Justin Bieber
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:30.800]   are two perfect examples of people who use the internet to their own advantage that's
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.760]   very effective that's why like you know it's hard you know I remember her music you know
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:41.680]   six months from now probably not and I also and I also listen to Lady Gaga just to annoy
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.760]   one of my colleagues you really want to you really want to annoy him listen to Justin
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:53.760]   Bieber no no this is like I just play the summer Lady Gaga's songs which basically
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:15:04.840]   puts makes me the devil in the company so I did I bought the 99 cents just because I
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:11.760]   just because it was it was cheap but apparently Gaga gets the same royalty whether you buy
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:17.680]   it from iTunes or Amazon so essentially Amazon's making up the difference billboard magazine
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:24.560]   estimated it was about seven dollars forty cents per purchase there were 440,000 copies
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.760]   of born this way sold on Amazon during that ninety nine cent promo on Monday and Thursday
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:37.080]   440,000 which means it cost Amazon about twenty one million dollars for this promotion was
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:44.240]   it worth it well it comes down to the cost of acquisition of a new user right it means
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:50.520]   that they paid seven and whatever dollars to get a new user maybe it's stick around
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:55.160]   but still worth it seems like not too much of a new you know not too high of a price
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.840]   to get a new user yeah yeah because those people now are buying music on Amazon they
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:04.400]   some of them set up Amazon accounts they didn't have before they know how to do it they've
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.800]   they can now come back and buy another album and they're using the cloud service right
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:16.040]   because as soon as you buy even one 99 cent album you got 20 gig storage the upside for
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:24.200]   Amazon is 400,000 new users in you know two days of promotion seems like a definite win
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.400]   no matter how you how you put it yeah and they get a lot of press I just think it's
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:35.800]   hysterical that almost been eleven ninety nine like enough you could have got a for
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:42.440]   ninety nine cents I already have the cloud service yeah as I said I couldn't wait you
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:50.360]   know come on it was my eye to the lurch we are we are all victims of this of these new
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:56.840]   technologies that's really the the the fact here I wish I could be a victim did the
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:03.000]   you get it is that's yeah can you get it in Canada amber I think so I didn't actually
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   buy it but I think we can yeah I'm pretty sure okay get ready for this because this we don't
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.560]   know yet but it's it's presumed by all in sundry that apple is now going to announce
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:18.640]   iCloud now that Amazon and Google have stepped forward with their music services everybody
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.920]   agrees in fact the you know there's a lot of evidence that they've already made amas unlike
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:29.840]   Amazon and Google apples making deals with record companies and here's what they're
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:36.160]   going to get because they've made a deal you now right now with Google music you can
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.920]   put twenty thousand songs up there which is amazing but you have to upload each and
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.120]   every one so it took me several days to get my six thousand song collection up there now
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.480]   it's up there it's on my phone I mean I don't I can stream it to my phone my my tablet whatever
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.600]   I like that what you really want to do though is just kind of run some program that says
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.480]   oh yeah you got that that and that will just put a copy up there and apparently this is
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:05.720]   what according to rumors this is what apple is going to do with iCloud they will scan
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:12.400]   your iTunes library and then put a high quality copy of that same song on your iCloud without
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:17.840]   uploading and that's why they're licensing it from the music companies they'll even replace
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:26.000]   any low-bit track copies with a high quality version fully licensed now unlike Google and
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.400]   Amazon they'll probably charge you well we don't know you know Google is probably going
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:37.600]   to charge you maybe this is the free beta now right it was estimated that if Google had
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:43.040]   done a deal that Google apparently talked to the music companies about this and everybody
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:47.240]   the music company said no to Google they were doing things like saying well you got a charge
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:52.640]   $30 a year for this but ultimately they they felt like Google was just a platform for piracy
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.800]   and they didn't want to have anything to do with it ridiculous but it's probably you
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:01.160]   know that thing that that apple is probably going to do which is can your library and
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:06.320]   getting making everything available to you is presumably what Amazon and Google wanted
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.320]   to do also but couldn't so they had to do that weird workaround where you have a locker
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:21.880]   in the sky in the clouds but Apple ironically is now the music labels best friends because
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:27.120]   Google and Amazon wouldn't play ball it's a it's quite an incredible turn of events and
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:34.360]   very lucky for apple yeah I'm excited about this I think it you know I'll definitely use
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:40.160]   it I think it's a good thing just to be able to have have access like that's all my music
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.160]   in the cloud I mean I'm constantly running around and I'm not near you know my computer
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.320]   and my iTunes library and then they're different on every computer I mean it's kind of a best
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.520]   to be honest with you right now so the idea I could just have it in one place to be able
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:57.440]   to access it anywhere online is a huge advantage and hopefully it happens soon I wouldn't write
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.240]   out right off Amazon I don't know if I think Google as usual is kind of fumbled this one
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:06.600]   but I wouldn't write off Amazon here I think that they're really they're doing so many interesting
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:11.800]   things I think this Gaga promotion was huge you do you know that they launched a Mac download
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:18.080]   store this week it was I don't think it got a lot of attention if you go to Amazon.com
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.840]   good luck finding it but you can but they launched a store that will allow you to download
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:31.440]   apps for Macintosh just like Apple's own app store well how is it to store though it's
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.120]   not a piece of software that you install install in your Mac doesn't automatically download
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.480]   and install the software it's just a page with lots of Mac software. Yeah for download
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:48.040]   right but really that's such a big deal I guess you get the rights to it and then you
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:53.520]   can reinstall it the software you bought Bob has a lot of the advantages of Apple store
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:59.160]   without a separate app does it is that that important and have an app no but I mean the
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:04.960]   big aspect of the app is also that it automatically installs and updates I'm sorry I have the
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:10.160]   app store and updates your apps I don't know how this is different from just a regular
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:14.680]   Amazon page don't you think it's interesting though that Amazon has now an Android app
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:21.080]   store and a Mac app store. Oh yeah I mean no this is regarding what you were saying earlier
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:26.480]   Amazon is going to be apparently it's very likely that within 6 to 12 months we're going
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:33.320]   to see Amazon emerge as the one competitor no one expected to Apple in that whole mobile
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:37.320]   world they're doing everything right and they've been doing everything right for the past
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.120]   few months how important is it services and how important is hardware to that is it
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.360]   Amazon of course is rumored that they'll have two Android tablets one will be a quad
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:52.120]   core before the end of the year is that a key to the whole thing essential yeah they
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:56.800]   have to in that world they have to control the experience which is what Google is also
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:01.240]   I'm sure you guys will agree but they're also trying to get their house in order a little
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:08.280]   bit and racing to get things cleaner. Do you think Amazon's a good bet right now home?
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:14.120]   Absolutely I think there is more I think we have to just take a little step back on this
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:21.680]   you know they this is a business or slash this is an effort which is going to be put
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:27.600]   in a services like dondor.com which is owned by CBS on the defensive number one number
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:36.040]   to the Amazon's businesses to sell things whether they are physical things or digital
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:43.200]   things whether it's video games music software if apps are what people want to buy they're
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:48.560]   essentially selling those and what they are going to do when it comes to tablets they're
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.640]   thinking about tablets or Kindle or whatever it is as a way to sell more digital goods
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.720]   that's they're not selling hardware they're selling digital goods so they're coming at
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:05.840]   it from the exact opposite end of the spectrum versus Apple. I think they have both these
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:11.840]   companies have very clear strategy and I think Amazon is taking the right approach they're
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:17.120]   being very methodical and you know what they have is what Google still doesn't have is
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:23.440]   access to people's purchasing this you know information they have one click and you can
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:30.040]   start buying whatever you need to buy an Amazon that is an incredibly powerful asset they have
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:34.400]   and they're leveraging it across different world because whether it is the Android store
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:39.520]   or the Mac store you know why shouldn't they be doing like a Windows store Amazon you know
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:45.120]   Windows store I'm sure they will. I mean if people want to pay for software and they can
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:51.040]   make it easy to buy why not. Well Microsoft Office which is on sale on the Mac store is
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:57.600]   a lot cheaper on the Mac store and you can use it on three computers. Right. And exactly
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:04.560]   corresponding to what Om is saying is saying look at the mp3 service that they offer from
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:11.200]   Amazon to Google you can't even buy anything on Google's for you. That's a major flaw that
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:18.120]   this is this is why you know Amazon could afford to antagonize the music labels talking
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.000]   about that you know music service specifically but they could afford to antagonize them because
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.320]   they already had the deals to enable the selling of music. Google could not afford to antagonize
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.880]   them and they did it anyway because they're Google. And there's such a comfort level I
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:36.240]   think with Amazon I think of my mom for example who's 67 and probably the only place she's
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:40.160]   ever bought anything and felt really comfortable about the online purchase is on Amazon.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:46.040]   No absolutely. Having known that site and that brand entrusted it for so long. Two things
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:52.200]   one click and prime guarantee that I will always look at Amazon to buy something before I go
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:25:00.880]   anywhere else. You know I wrote a post recently and in last five years the amount of money
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:09.440]   spent by us on Amazon per year has doubled. And that's primarily because of since 2006
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:17.280]   that's primarily because of the availability of you know Amazon Prime and a lot more of
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.320]   these digital goods. When you say us you mean the Malick family or you mean us Americans?
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:30.240]   The average Amazon customer. And the reason for that is I think when you make it that
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:37.280]   simple when it's one click purchasing decision and when it comes to digital goods it is actually
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:43.200]   we don't even think about it. It's not real money. Right it's almost like a game you know we click
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:50.320]   it downwards. It's only you know it's only a few couple of dollars right but the impact
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.360]   of that over 12 months is massive. Oh yeah I don't like to look at my Amazon bill.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:04.160]   Yeah which part of culture and you know internet tool property are they're not serving right now.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:11.840]   They have video, music, apps, books obviously with the Kindle. They have everything. All the
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:18.320]   pieces are falling into place. Yeah and the Kindle is selling very well. They said more than physical
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.960]   books. That's right. And they said this new ad supported Kindle the 114 dollar Kindle is the best
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.960]   selling Kindle they've ever made. It's already outselling the previous Kindle's. That one I don't get.
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:37.120]   For $20 you're going to save $25. I bought it. You know it's you don't count you buy everything.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.600]   Oh I did. Yeah I actually bought it by accident. I one clicked. I didn't even know it arrived and
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:47.920]   I said did I buy that? And that's exactly your point. You know it's almost point exactly. It's
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:53.280]   too damn easy. Yeah I just push the. That's how I feel about apps in general. I just I keep buying
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.000]   apps. Yeah. You know some apps can get expensive. I just bought an app recently for $13.99 and
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.240]   you know just adds up and even the month you just can't believe you bought so many.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:09.280]   Yeah. That's not good. Yeah. Hey Zanz we're talking about Amazon. I want to talk about
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.560]   our one of our fine sponsors. It's happens to be an Amazon company. We're talking about Audible.com
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:21.040]   the audio bookstore. This I tell you that you know the new Amazon Kindle I was really surprised.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:27.600]   I thought this was a very interesting use of integration. When I you know you it's it's your
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.160]   account so you open it up and it has all your books. It also had all the Amazon the Audible books
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.640]   I'd ever purchased and it would automatically be downloaded to the Kindle. That's I don't know if
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.720]   that's on other Kindles or if it's just the new Kindle but it's certainly where Amazon's going
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:46.240]   forward and I love it because you know now I've got my audio and my Kindle books all available on
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:53.120]   the same device. Audible.com/twit2 here's how you get involved with Audible. If you've never
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:59.280]   listened to books before we understand maybe that's a little scary. Maybe you maybe you want to try
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:08.800]   before you buy. Well go to audible.com/twit2 you get two books two books free. You sign up for the
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.200]   platinum account that's two books a month. Your first month is free. The books are free and they're
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:20.240]   yours to keep forever cancel at any time. I just you know every time I actually it's bad because
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:26.080]   every time I go to the Audible page I go oh here's another interesting book. Oh the Believing Brain
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.320]   from Ghost to God's Ball. How we construct beliefs and reinforce them. See I can't wait to read this.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.520]   It's like going to a great bookstore and the neat thing is about Audible is that you know you can
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.400]   listen to these in your car at the gym as you're cleaning the house. There's so many places that
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:45.840]   you can listen to Audible books that you really couldn't get be reading anyway. This is the one
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:51.280]   that this is next on my Audible Listen List. I love David McCullough. I love his voice. I love his
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.640]   writing. He's one of the great historians and I think you'd like this Patrick. It's called The
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:01.040]   Greater Journey Americans in Paris. It's about American artists, writers, doctors, politicians,
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:08.640]   architects who set off for Paris between the years of 1830 and 1900. And I mean so many great
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:16.240]   American cultural icons like Ralph Waldo Enmerson, Mark Twain, Oliver Wender Holmes, Nathaniel Hawthorne,
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:21.200]   Harriet Beecher Stowe lived in Paris as they created. So this has got my two favorite things.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.560]   Paris and David McCullough. Listen a little bit to The Greater Journey Americans in Paris.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:32.720]   David McCullough's you'll recognize his. Oh wait a minute. Oh he doesn't read it. Edward Herman reads
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:40.480]   it. But he was also great. Another great actor. I'm not getting any audio from it. That's my
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:44.000]   fault. I'm doing something wrong. That is by the way one of the nice features on the Audible
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.600]   site audible.com/twit2 as you can listen to any book preview it and see how you like the reader
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:53.600]   and so forth. So there's one book. I see that another one of my all time favorites has been
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:58.480]   named as the best audio book of the year one in the audio audio word. Keith Richards fantastic
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:03.120]   life. So good. Did you read that Amber? Yeah actually that is so good. And another one that was
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:08.640]   recommended. Sarah Lane recommended it on Audible to me is Bossy Pants by Tina and she narrates it
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.280]   and it's fantastic. She's phenomenal. So here's the problem. You get to Audible and you can't stop.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:20.240]   It's like candy for your brain. Audible.com/twit2. If you haven't yet tried Audible give it a try.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:23.840]   Bossy Pants is the number one book right now on Audible and then the David McCullough book is the
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:30.880]   number two in their top downloads. Oh wait a minute the zombie apocalypse is coming. Wait a minute.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.120]   You see and I start reading the science fiction. These are all zombie books.
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:44.400]   Oh man. If you like Audible you see you can't eat just one Audible.com/twit2 get two books today.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:51.760]   Absolutely free but watch out. You're gonna get hooked. Amazon bought them what's been about a
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:57.520]   year and I keep waiting for you know what I really want. I want whisper sync on Audible. You know how
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:01.360]   when you're reading a book on the Kindle and then you read it on your iPad or your computer it
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:06.800]   jumps to the last page you read on any device. I want that with audio so that I could like listen
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.080]   to a book while I'm doing the dishes and then getting you know then getting bent and then have
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:20.560]   my Kindle and it would jump to that page. I want that but I know I'm asking a lot. Audible.com/twit2
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:30.800]   I'll tell you the internet is great for consumers. Ohm puts a link to this great song on his blog
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:39.440]   home is.me. It's a Bruno Mars song you've seen at the lazy song but this is Leonard Nimoy
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:47.760]   in it doing kind of a tribute to the dude the big Lebowski. This is such a great video. You're
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.960]   absolutely right. Oh my just love this video. For some reason I'm not getting audio out of this
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:55.440]   oh because I pushed the wrong button. Here we go.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:10.880]   It was single stroke. Leonard Nimoy completely rejuvenates his career.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.440]   Is this something that you did for promotional purposes? You know it's not the official Bruno Mars
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:28.720]   video for this song but you got to figure I mean I don't know what's the story Ohm do you know?
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:35.440]   This is just a special video I think you did or something. It's so great. It's so pretty awesome.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:40.080]   It's so funny. The one who's out of the house he's eating cereal out of the box
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:47.520]   his neighbor waves at him he goes. He leaves throws the empty cereal box on the lawn
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.480]   and then walks to the drugstore and his slippers in bathrobe.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:54.800]   Yeah gives him the Vulcan mind meld.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:33:05.520]   This is straight out of the big Lebowski. This is a tribute to Jeff Bridges in the big Lebowski.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:21.120]   I'm sorry I just. It's a great song. That's marketing. Get Leonard Nimoy. We're going to try to get
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:26.320]   Leonard on the on the show. He's a geek apparently he's a photographer. There's a lot of great photography.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:34.880]   Your friends with Steve Martin all the oh so that's only yeah Leonard Nimoy Steve Martin what the hell?
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.920]   Good company superstars. A couple more stories we're going to wrap this thing up.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:54.720]   Sony says we're going to restore PSN by May 31st unless we don't. Okay.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:00.560]   I got you got a feel for everything Amazon's doing right it seems like Sony's doing something wrong.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.520]   Congratulations to you O'Malley. You raised another six million dollars you are now Giga
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:15.680]   Ome is now worth 40 million buckaroos. So I've heard. Well I hope you put some of that in your pocket.
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:23.200]   No it's all into the company we keep growing it and hopefully you know everything workshot as
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:27.600]   we plan. It's good. Are you looking to be acquired at some point or what is your strategy?
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:35.440]   We just raise capital the idea is to grow this into a big business and it's not just me that is
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:45.280]   40 people who work at the company who work incredibly hard and we've pushed into subscriptions
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.000]   and paid content and it's going incredibly well for us. So that's great.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.440]   Well Huffpo how much did Huffpo sell to AOL for?
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:00.640]   315 315 million. That's what I still can't get over that they don't pay any of their
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:07.600]   bloggers or writers. I haven't gotten past that point yet. Ariana has likes likes of nice clothing.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:15.760]   Zynga is about to file for its IPO. Now LinkedIn had a massive IPO a couple of weeks ago.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:22.320]   I think we're are we going to start seeing a little heating up of the of the public offerings
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:28.960]   in the tech world. I think the Zynga one will will be will change the game quite huge isn't it?
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:36.320]   Yeah. I think they have such massive revenue numbers. So they have such massive growth that
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:43.280]   that they will eventually be the catalyst for the a lot of the companies to go public.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:50.240]   I mean Zynga is the kind of company which can energize the IPO market. They claim 250 million
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:57.040]   people actively playing their games every month. Yeah. Cityville which I guess is a sequel to the
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:04.240]   very popular Farmville attracts 90 million monthly users. Even the original poker game still got 35
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:13.760]   million users. Didn't Lady Gaga do a Gagaville? That's like a part of Farmville.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:22.560]   400 million dollars in profit on 850 million dollars in revenue. They're valued at 10 billion right now.
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:31.360]   But they'll probably go off it even more than that. Wow. Do you think we're in a bubble home?
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.840]   No, no. I don't think you know to call it a bubble is
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:44.480]   not right now. Give it another 12 to 18 month and then you can see more insanity
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:53.440]   than we would be in a bubble. Right now I think what we are is an overheated investment environment
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:37:00.160]   and it's investments in a certain kind of tech company. What you're seeing is you're hearing about
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:06.320]   these companies and these funding so much more often than you used to in the past
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:12.000]   and it gets amplified on Facebook and Twitter so quickly so you start to believe that there is an
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000]   actual bubble. There is a bubble at the lower end of the spectrum where new companies are getting
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.960]   funding. If you look at LinkedIn it's a pretty solid company. It's been around for almost 10
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:29.760]   years. I mean just because it's the first new exciting technology IPO in a long long time.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:35.360]   So people are overpaying for it right now and it's you know I do find its own median.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:42.320]   These pent up demand. There is and I think bubble is when you start to see companies
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:48.800]   with absolutely no fundamentals. Right. Start to go public and you know everybody around you
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.960]   starts to talk about them. That's when you know things are incredibly crazy. Right now
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:00.720]   market is extremely extremely overheated. People are very excited. There's a lot of excitement
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:08.560]   going on in the valley that is still doesn't reconcile with the overall economy. Right.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:14.000]   The overall economy is still pretty slow. Things are not going that well. But you also have to
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.800]   remember there is because there is no other opportunity to invest in. A lot more people are
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.240]   interested in investing in technology now. Right. So everybody is putting their attention on
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:33.200]   technology. That's why JP Morgan has like a fund for Twitter and social stuff. And you know
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:39.120]   Goldman Sachs is investing in companies like Facebook. It's most most of that is because
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:45.440]   there aren't that many growth opportunities elsewhere. The overall economy to put it mildly
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:49.920]   still sucks. I just wonder what's going to happen to all these mobile companies though.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:53.040]   Especially some of the mobile companies that have you know they've gotten a couple million
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.480]   dollars and they have sort of one hit wonders. You know like one game that has done really
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:59.200]   well and then there's this pressure to come out with something else. But then there's obviously
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:03.120]   someone right on their heels. It just seems in the mobile space particularly like Alm said with a
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.120]   lot of the you know some of the smaller companies that you know you can get money just by having
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.440]   you know a decent idea on the mobile front in a game that you project will have some revenue.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.760]   And you see this all over the place right now. But you know who's shown that you can do well with
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:22.640]   one hit is a Rovia with Angry Birds. I mean that's really a one game company. They've just
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:29.200]   sliced it and diced it so many great ways that 200 million downloads of Angry Birds.
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:34.240]   And also the heist the new game that just came out from the creators of Camera Plus.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:38.800]   Just I was reading an article where I think they're getting a download every second since they
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.880]   launched or something. Which by the way why Lisa Bettany no longer hosts our photo show.
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.440]   It makes sense. She's making a little too much money on the internet there.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:56.080]   That's keeping her pretty busy. I think the thing Amber brought up a very good point. I think
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:05.200]   even Angry Birds has to prove that it's like Zingar it can take one hit game and create a
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:13.680]   franchise of multiple games and multiple revenue opportunities. So I think this is you know we can't
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:18.800]   like the thing is if we could look into the future and predict it we'll all be billionaires right.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:24.400]   So we can't. So right now what we have is anecdotal information and we're trying to project what's
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:30.480]   going to happen. I just think it's going to be a little bit more frothy over next 12 months.
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:35.600]   And there's very little loyalty I find you know if all of a sudden a game developer has come
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:38.960]   out with one mobile game and it's really cool. It's not as though you know I'm following what
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:43.280]   that developer is producing next time around. It's there's just not that loyalty there like there
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:47.200]   maybe were with some of the websites and you know 10 years ago a decade ago where people were
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:51.520]   born from sites and really latched on to the whole experience on the site. People don't really know
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:55.680]   who's behind what games coming out. So I think that that's also a tougher sell long term.
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:59.120]   Well if I were going to invest to be in Amazon it'd be in Zinga.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:06.640]   I mean there's definitely some companies that look strong. But fortunately I do not invest in
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:14.160]   tech stocks and that's why I'm not broke right now. Amber MacArthur is at ambermac.com.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:20.240]   She's on the Twitter. She's on the Tube. She's got the great command and TV show and she'll be back
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.560]   on Monday for the social hour with Sarah Lane. Actually we shot early this week so it'll be
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:31.520]   in a long weekend. So a week from Monday will be back on live. What time do you do that show 11am?
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:39.520]   Yeah 11am Pacific time on Mondays. 2 p.m. Eastern 1800 UTC live.tuit.tv.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:45.440]   Oh Malek is at gigaohm.com and don't forget he's got a great new newsletter which you should
