[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's time for Twit this weekend Tech.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Leo's off today on Mike Elgin filling in Chicago Sun Times technology journalist
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Mac Break Weekly host Andy Anatko is here.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   So it's Kevin Tofill, senior writer for Giga Home.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   And we've also got Lee Hutchinson, senior reviews editor at R's Technica.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   We'll talk about the big Apple announcements of course, the Apple Watch, the Apple Pay
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   and the Apple iPhone.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   A great device with a flawed rollout.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Plus, which is the very best smartphone of the year.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   We'll try to answer that question.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And Facebook is under fire this week for its spyware like Messenger app
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   and also its real name's policy.

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And we bring them in here and have a technology conversation of the week.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Joining me today is Andy and Nato, the tech journalist for the Chicago Sun Times, host of Mac Break Weekly
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   and internationally beloved industry figure. Welcome, Andy.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Thanks, Mike. Thanks for mentioning my international belovedness.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'm too proud to mention it myself.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Well, you trademarked it so you must be a little proud of it.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Just kidding, you didn't actually trademark it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I got a postcard from someone in Canada saying that they love me.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   So technically it's another country so I am internationally beloved.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It will stand up in court.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Now you've been on a quest recently to find a foldable Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I remember those back in the, like what, 10 years ago they were all the rage.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   How is that quest going?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   It's going pretty well. I have an inventory, two different folding keyboards.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   One is a Matthias keyboard that's still for sale, but that's like an extended folding keyboard that's about this big when it's folded up.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I also have a verbatim one that's a little bit smaller but probably a little bit bigger.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   The idea is to try to find one that's as close to the size of the iPhone 6 Plus as possible to try to see how much work you can do with everything in like your very ample coat pocket.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So I bought a couple of different ones that are available on Amazon so they'll be arriving soon.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   What we've all been looking for and hoping for is I think the one that you were talking about, the one that Paul used to sell, which is the most incredible and incredible.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And reassuringly nice thing. It folded into the size of a tiny paperback book, but then it just in a very nice metallic clank, clank, clank, like a transformer.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You needed a flat surface for it, but it transformed into this really nice notebook style keyboard.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And I'm shocked that especially with how popular smartphones are and how good they are the software for it.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Whoever has the international, the intellectual property on that.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I'm amazed they have not done a Bluetooth version of this.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I've got $80 for it. I'll put $80, tape it to my monitor, waiting for the person who makes a Bluetooth version of this keyboard.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I couldn't agree with you more. Of course, we're writers. Have you ever written or do you intend to be writing columns on a phone?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I've written a couple only when I've really been caught in a true emergency where there's been a news story and I get a text from my editor saying, "Hey, can you give us 800 words on this in the next two hours?"
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   But that's the reason why I normally travel with an iPad and often travel with both an iPad and an Apple extended, excuse me, an Apple wireless keyboard.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I mean, even if I'm just out of the office for three or four hours, I'll have this with me.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   But it's really intriguing to me to replace that kit with a phone screen that's big enough and a keyboard that's good enough to actually allow me to put that in a pocket or at least have a smaller pouch for it.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Yeah. I'm sure about Boy, that iPhone 6 Plus, that is really right within the pipeline.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's a very Andy and not-go sort of. Andy, we want you to switch back to the spec that iOS and iPhone.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Even if we have to make a big phone to make you do it, that's how much we want you back.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   They care about you, Andy, and it's very clear with that phone. I totally agree with you. I love the big phone.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   We'll talk about that in just a sec.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   What you're doing with us today is Kevin Tofill, senior writer for Gig Aome, who specializes in mobile and wearable computing.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   That's one of the reasons he's here. He's also here because I love having on Tech News today. He's one of my favorite guests.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Welcome, Kevin.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Good to be here. It's always Mike. I am not internationally beloved, but hopefully I'm locally beloved.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I'm going to check that out after the show. Andy's going to hate me because I have one of the original Stowaway portable Bluetooth keyboards.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   That's the one. I have one in my closet along with all the other gadgets of yesterday year.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It's just awesome. It's a shame they don't make them anymore, quite honestly.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Kevin, you wrote about one of the craziest Android apps I've ever heard of called the Cosmos browser.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Can you tell us about this Wacky product?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   It is Wacky, but it's actually useful, I think, in certain areas where maybe a data plan is too expensive
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   or you live in a region or an area that just doesn't have even a 2G or 3G network.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   What Cosmos browser is, it was created at a hackathon.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   What it does is it's basically a way for you to get web access without any mobile broadband or without Wi-Fi.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   What you do is you use this browser, it's for Android, and you send the address or URL of a website as an SMS message in the app.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   What happens is on the back end, the URL is parsed out, the content is taken, it's compressed, and it's sent back to you over SMS.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Basically, you don't see any of the CSS or JavaScript, you just get straight, straight, straight, straight, 8G, the SMS networks.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Maybe it's not even any charge for you. Also, it works when you don't have any data signal at all.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Kevin, there was a Skype glitch, not your fault at all, but it had this really cool hip hop sort of like a...
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Max headroom.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   That was cool, yeah. For the recorded version, you're going to enjoy that. That was a really cool effect.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Also with us today is Lee Hutchinson, senior reviews editor at RSTechnica.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Lee also writes about manned space flight, as you can see from the background there. Welcome to you, Lee.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Lee's very quiet.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You had a muted.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I think we had a muted.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   No, that was not an iron.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I was muted so that you didn't hear me talking about keyboards.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I muted so that you don't hear my buckling-
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Wow.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Unicomp keyboard that weighs 8 pounds.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   You put an eye out with that.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Lee, you've been in RSTechnica. You mentioned recently that you've been in RSTechnica for two years now.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   RSTechnica seems like a really interesting and unique publication. What's it like to work there?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Oh man, my wife has asked me about this before because I'm not by trade a journalist.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I'm a sysadman and an IT guy who wrote on the side for a while.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   When Ken Fisher asked me to join, it was a really big career change for me.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I have to tell you, after having been here for two years, September 10th was my second service anniversary at RST.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It is the greatest bunch of people I've ever had the honor of working with.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   The work environment is, as I'm sure you can imagine, really lively and really hilarious.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It's just great. It's a great bunch of people. It's a great job.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Every day is kind of a gift, I guess.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   You guys write some really cool stuff and you write a lot of really cool stuff personally.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   It's really exciting to see that.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Welcome to the fraternity of journalists.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I'm sure you drink much more heavily now and you have a penchant for free food and so on.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Welcome to the world of journalism.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   One of the only professions that is more lowly rated among the public opinion than IT people.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   That was a step in the wrong direction.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But anyway, it's great stuff and I really enjoy all of your work.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Let's jump into it.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Of course, the big news this week is everything that Apple announced.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   A lot of my Android fan friends have asked me, "Please, enough with the Apple stuff already."
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   We do have to cover certain things, but I want to zero in on some of the unique things
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   that have been under-covered about the Apple event.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Starting with the watch, the watch, of course, in general is a point of controversy with
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   the Apple lovers saying it's the greatest thing in history of mankind.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   The Apple haters saying it's a copycat, it's overpriced, it's too big, it's so on.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   All of that, of course, is true to a certain extent.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I want to talk about a couple aspects of this watch, not only about the watch itself,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   but the technology and how it's being implemented, and also what its prospects are for being
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   a popular culture shifting sort of item, which I have a tendency to believe that it is.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   The two general areas of technology that I want to focus in on, because we've talked about
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   all the wristbands and the gold and all that kind of stuff, ad nauseum all week long,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   is the pressure sensitive screen, which is really interesting.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Also, the Taptics engine and how Apple is implementing that.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Let's just go around the Horn app.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Andy, you were playing with it, you came right out of the Flint Center building to talk to
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   us on our live coverage.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   You were impressed with certain aspects of it, but I've read since then that you're kind
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   of on the fence, you don't have a really good reading about whether this is the greatest
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   thing ever or if it's just an also-run thing that's just overpriced.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   What is your feeling right now as it now exists about the Apple Watch?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Right now, I just don't think I have enough information to have a real opinion on it yet.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   As a physical object, I think it's great.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I think it's the first smartwatch I've ever seen that if this were an analog watch,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I would consider buying it just as an analog watch, the stainless steel version with that
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   serpentine metal band, man, that's a handsome piece of jewelry.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   But the problem was that I think it was a much different rollout than the iPhone rollout was
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   or the iPad rollout was, and I was at both of those things, and you left at the end of it
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   with a very clear picture of what Apple intended people to do with this.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Here is the entire story from start to ending of what this product is.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Remember, both of those products, those weren't shipping for several months either.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   At the end of the day, from the Apple Watch event, I felt like they'd shown me a complete
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   picture about the fitness features, but I did not know what sort of role they intended
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   for this to play in people's daily lives.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   For instance, I was really concerned that the last thing I expected to see was,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   as part of the demonstration, is here is a constellation of dozens and dozens of application icons.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   So many, you need to zoom in and scroll in order to select an app.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I'm saying, "Do I want dozens and dozens of application icons on a wristwatch?"
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   When I have a phone right in my pocket.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And guess what?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   There are so many ways to interact with it.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   You can tap on the screen, you can press because it's pressure sensitive, and press
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   and hold down the screen, you can swipe on the screen, we have a scroll wheel here,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   there's a button on the scroll wheel too, and there's a second button right over here
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   underneath it for other purposes.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   And that was another thing that I would not have predicted from an Apple Watch.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Like, doesn't that sound like a lot of controls for, again, a simple device?
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I know that the difficulty is that we're all of us, the makers, the consumers,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   and those of us who have to talk and write about it, we're all trying to figure out
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   what the role of a computer on your wrist is supposed to be.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   We're expecting it to be as radical as the difference between a tablet and a notebook
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   or a phone and a tablet.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And I just don't think Apple really made it very clear to us whether or not we're supposed to,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   this is supposed to be a device that we glance at as we would glance a watch to get a specific
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   piece of information and then go back to our lives, or whether we're meant to sit there
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   like twiddling this thing and just looking at photos and getting news information
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   and navigating the universe and checking out planets.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So it's possible that Apple themselves are still working on the software and they're still working
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   on what they think this is going to be.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   For now, again, I just don't have enough information to reach a conclusion,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   particularly based on we had access to what looked to be finished hardware,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   but the watches that were actually running interactive software were only on the wrists
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   of senior Apple executives and the demonstrators and we were not allowed to touch those in any way,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   shape or form.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   So I'm looking forward to the coming months when maybe Apple will reveal a little bit more
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   about the sort of software they expect developers to write for it.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   More importantly, the sort of software that they hope the developers will not write for it.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And when I get my first chance to really go hands on with this and figure out what that experience is like.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   So Kevin, let me give you my little theory about the Apple Watch.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It's essentially that they got a long list of things wrong.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   It's too big.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   It's too ugly.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   It's too expensive.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   The interface stuff that Andy talked about is definitely a problem that's scrolling around
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   all the millions of icons.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   There are a lot of problems about it and there's many aspects about the Apple Watch that are identical
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   in function to any other sort of Android Wear watch or any of the non-Android Wear watch
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   watches out there, even the Tizen watches.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   But my essential theory is that Apple is onto something that is really tapping into the future
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   of wearable technology in general.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   You're a wearable writer.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   You write a lot about the wearable space.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And what that thing is is that the Taptics engine combined with sound, combined with the touch interface,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   brings into your experience a lot more of your senses.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   So instead of like, here's some information going out and here's some information coming back in,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   it's tactile.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   So for example, these facts are underreported in my opinion.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   When you sit there and use the scroll wheel, there's a specific vibration and a specific
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   sound that's associated with that gesture that's exactly in sync with that gesture that you
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   feel on the bottom of the wrist.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   When you tap on the top of the screen, you feel that your own tap on your skin.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And when you move things around, everything has a haptic element with a combined sound that
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   goes with that.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   And so the end result is that this thing becomes kind of psychologically and emotionally part
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   of your body, essentially.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Instead of just being a thing that shuttles information on and off, it becomes part of
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   you and inevitably will have phantom vibration syndrome and all that kind of stuff later
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   on.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   What do you think about that theory?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Does that make sense to you or does that just sound like some fancy features that they're
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   throwing in that are just designed to be harder to do for their competitors?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   No, I think you're onto something there, Mike.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.320]   And I think Apple is onto something too, but I have to agree with Andy in that they haven't
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.320]   told the whole story.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.560]   As much information came out of the event, I actually only wrote one post out of the
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.280]   entire event.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.280]   And it revolved around, did Apple really give people a reason to want this thing?
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.160]   I basically said they're trying to redefine a market that isn't yet defined, and that's
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.600]   kind of new territory for them.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.960]   Now granted, the haptic feedback, it does look more advanced than what we have on competing
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   devices.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.480]   I love the idea that as you're getting navigation directions, you don't even have to glance
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   at your watch.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.840]   You'll feel the left tap or the right tap when it's time to make your left turn or your
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.440]   right turn if you're walking around, for example.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.600]   I think that's where some of the innovation lies, but I don't think that we've yet seen
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.920]   the full story in how that's going to be applied.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.360]   It comes down to what do people want this thing for?
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.240]   What does Apple want people to use this for?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.720]   The haptics are interesting to me very much so.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   But granted, we've had haptics in devices forever, and there have been some improvements
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   on that.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.880]   Some keyboards have haptics that are kind of, if you're tapping on the left side of the
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.720]   screen, you could kind of feel the haptic touch on the left side as you're touching and so
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.280]   on.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.360]   But I'm not sure that the whole story's been told here.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.280]   If you notice, Apple did not call this a smartwatch, not one single time.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.920]   What we've been talking about here is smartwatches by and large wearable devices and so on.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.720]   I don't think that Apple wants this to be classified as a smartwatch.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.240]   I think, Mike, what they're going after is that physical experience, that psychological
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.680]   experience that you were just mentioning, and they're still working out the bits and
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.120]   pieces on how to make that happen without calling this a smartwatch.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.320]   Because let's face it, a lot of the features, as you said, they're already available on
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.960]   Android Wear and such.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.760]   But are they compelling features?
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.720]   Favouriting a photo on my iPhone so I can see it on my watch.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.440]   Why would I do that when I have to have the phone with me?
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.280]   I want to see it on the bigger screen, the better screen.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.000]   That's not a compelling reason to spend $350 or much more because that's the starting
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.480]   price, probably for the lowest and smallest watch.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.600]   So again, the haptics, the pressure sensitivity, it sounds interesting.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.080]   Apple's good at heartless.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.160]   I'm not even sure about the whole touch versus tap and the pressure sensitivity though because
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.640]   let's face it.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:15.720]   When your iPhone can detect a touch or a tap, if you tap and hold it knows that you want
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.360]   to rearrange your home screen.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.640]   There was a lot of marketing mumbo jumbo around that and I'm not completely sold on
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.880]   that being innovative yet.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.360]   I really need to see the product.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.200]   So Lee, I think you're an Android guy, right?
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.120]   You're not an iPhone user, are you?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.200]   I'm pretty agnostic actually.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.960]   I've got one of just about everything.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.200]   My daily driver, the phone that I actually own and paid for is an iPhone.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.080]   Yeah, but I bounce back and forth between iOS and Windows Phone and Android pretty regularly.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:51.160]   In addition to this watch touching you, Apple, this interesting concept, Apple touching you
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.320]   all the time, they're also going to be touching your money with Apple Pay.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.120]   And this is an interesting implementation I think for the Apple watch because essentially
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.480]   how it works is you authenticate the watch, presumably with your fingerprint on the phone.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.800]   And then as long as the watch stays lashed to your wrist, you're good to go to pay for
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.400]   stuff and as soon as you remove it from your wrist, it loses the authentication and you
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.080]   can't do it anymore.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.080]   Generally speaking, what did you think of Apple Pay not only as a technology and the
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.280]   implementation of that technology, but as a competitor to all the other methods for electronic
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.440]   and mobile payment?
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.600]   Well, you know, it's an interesting question and the best answer I can give you is that
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.880]   even if something hasn't necessarily taken over the world by storm yet, don't discount
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   Apple.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.880]   They seem to have a way of taking technologies that are sort of right on the edge and then
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:45.160]   pushing them into mainstream and having people adopt them.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.480]   I'm not really sure if it's something that I would necessarily use the integrated watch
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:56.280]   pay, but at the same time, I'm kind of old-fashioned and the idea of storing payment details in
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.360]   a mobile device like that really kind of makes me nervous, which maybe means I'm outdated.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.640]   But it's not really something that I think I would take advantage of very much.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:10.680]   Credit cards are a well-established system, merchant agreements between the people who
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.640]   are accepting cards and the card, the banks and everything.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.480]   The payment processors, MasterCard and Visa do a really great job of protecting consumers.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.560]   But Apple adding them into that link, adding any payment, a mobile payment system into
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.240]   that link is just another speed bump to overcome.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.000]   We actually just published today, I believe, a really good overview of Apple Pay written
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   by Megan Geis, one of my guys, she's a girl, but written by one of my people.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.600]   She goes really in-depth on how it works out.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.200]   But I don't know.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.320]   The analogy that I read online was that I'm going to screw this up.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.960]   It's like Google pushes the frontiers and then Apple sort of brings all the settlers
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.600]   in after the frontiers have been pushed.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.880]   And I think that you'll probably see mobile payments looking at one of those things where
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.880]   it's like that.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:03.280]   Like Google and other smart watch vendors have sort of tread this territory before and phones
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.280]   too.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.640]   But now we're going to see, I think, it actually taking off because Apple's going to push it
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.200]   mainstream as they have done with lots of things that a lot of folks didn't know they
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.640]   needed, like tablets, for example.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.600]   And of course, Apple is going to market the heck out of it.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.040]   We have a new Apple Watch commercial.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.680]   Let's take a look at that, Chad.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.400]   The iPhone, the iPad, and now the Apple Watch.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.400]   The Apple Watch.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.240]   Damn, I'm never going to get used to that.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.560]   The Apple Watch stands for a pleasantly plump little electronic watch.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.560]   Android's terrible.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   Come here.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.400]   It does so many cool little thingies.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.880]   You can share your heartbeat for some reason.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.440]   You can try looking at pictures on a one-inch screen.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.800]   You can buy five in a row and watch them dance.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.080]   You can thumb something down or up.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.760]   You can even set the date just like a regular watch.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.800]   Oh, it's got maps on it.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.760]   Kind of like the phone you already have.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.760]   Can it tell time?
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   Yes.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   Do you have to charge it every night?
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.760]   Yes.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.760]   Just like a regular watch.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.440]   Sending emoji has never been more complicated.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.480]   You can draw and send pictures to your friends.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.800]   We don't know how to turn off dick pics though.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.240]   I mean, it's going to happen.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.080]   That'll be a feature that'll come in the iWatch 2.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.680]   Apple, Apple Watch 2.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.440]   I'm never going to not say that.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.600]   Now you can watch YouTube videos right on your watch.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.080]   Now you can watch YouTube videos right on your watch.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.560]   Hey man, can you like move?
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560]   Shut up, man.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.560]   It also comes with Apple Pay so you can use your watch like a credit card.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.000]   And trust us, Apple will keep your banking information very secure.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.560]   Just like all those nude pics.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   Now a lot.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.280]   You might not be an official.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.560]   Adam, not really sure about that.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.400]   But how can you tell?
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.400]   Really?
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.320]   I will say that what the guy was saying about the iWatch versus the Apple Watch, I recently
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   one of us at ours is still saying iWatch.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   Yep.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.680]   Because otherwise it's like, which watch are you talking about the Apple?
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.640]   Oh yeah, just iWatch.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.080]   Tim Cook did it too on some network TV show.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.120]   He actually said the iWatch.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.320]   It's a difficult one to break and I think everybody's making the same mistake.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.240]   Although it's probably cool to see them retire the i thing.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.640]   That was kind of a trend years and years and years ago when the iPod came out.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.960]   That was the thing people were putting e and then i in front of everything.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.080]   So I think Apple Watch makes a lot more sense.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.920]   And I'm guessing the next phone will be called the Apple phone or something.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.280]   But I didn't like that Tim Cook came out and did the one more thing.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.360]   That was something that I really I was I was happy when he did it.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.160]   That was, you know, that was a good callback.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   I like that.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   He stole that from Xiaomi.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:49.440]   Not only that, but the entire event.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.440]   I was just the absolute glee in his voice and his facial expressions and his body language
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:01.200]   was when he first started to talk about the iWatch that you could see.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.720]   I saw this exact same sort of stuff on Steve Jobs face when he was introducing the iPhone
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.880]   and you just immediately hits you that this guy has been keeping a lid on a secret for
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:15.840]   like a year or two or three and now he finally gets to tell everybody about this cool thing
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.880]   that he and the rest of the team have been working on.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.520]   And it's a it was there's some obvious pride there.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.320]   It is and Tim Cook has in the past, I mean, I'm sure you've watched, you know, most of
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.200]   the presentations that he's done.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.800]   He sometimes has almost the best way to put this.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.520]   He sometimes seems like he's not the most enthusiastic presenter.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.480]   Like he he often comes out and he looks like he's maybe a little nervous or maybe about
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.680]   to puke on stage or whatever.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.080]   But yeah, and you're absolutely right, Andy.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.240]   This time he came out and it was, you know, he was he was gleeful.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.240]   He was engaging.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.560]   It was really good to see.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.760]   It was clear that this was his way of stepping out from under Steve's shadow.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:25:00.080]   This was the Tim Show, the first major product released on his watch, no pun intended and
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.160]   you could you're right.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.800]   You guys could see that the obvious pride he was excited to show this off and showing
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:12.000]   his emotions, I think here were higher than anything else I've seen him present so far.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.720]   It was it was actually nice to see for him.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.760]   Plus he got to touch Bono's finger.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.760]   That was a highlight.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.560]   Now he he he's so excited.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.800]   It got gave me the feeling that they were going to tell him that there was a big meltdown
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.280]   that they were essentially showing the truck schedule for a lot of this announcement.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.400]   And then later they were giving the Mandarin or Japanese translations as part of this thing.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.280]   The entire launch has been plagued by problems.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.560]   There had been three major problems.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.680]   One of them was the fiasco at the for the video when they rolled out the announcement.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.360]   We covered it live and it was just a train wreck in terms of, you know, the weird audio,
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.920]   the truck schedule, all that kind of stuff.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.760]   And then when they did pre-orders they got everybody on the East Coast up at three o'clock
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.760]   in the morning to order this phone for some reason.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.000]   And then there were glitches and and they quickly ran out even though lots of people
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.040]   had trouble ordering it.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.520]   And there were probably shortages in the United States because they probably reserved millions
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.960]   of these units for China.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.520]   But then the Chinese government didn't approve them for sale.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.520]   And we still as far as I know don't have a date for when the iPhones would be available
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.200]   for sale in in China.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.800]   And this seems to be part of the ongoing harassment by the Chinese government of American technology
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:25.120]   companies for a long list of reasons and gripes that they have plus to protect Chinese companies
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120]   presumably.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.160]   So how bad is this for Apple?
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.000]   Do you think there are these passing glitches that people will forget about or is this is
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.680]   this going to go down in history as a flawed and glitch filled launch?
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:45.320]   I hope not because the thing about the all the work and all the thought that goes into
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   developing two new phones and a brand new platform.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.640]   And then we're really going to dismiss that because the video feed was not good and because
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.280]   they couldn't handle the initial on rush of orders.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.160]   It's embarrassing certainly because Apple is certainly very known for they're the company
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.120]   that says we make sure that the back of the fence is painted just as well as the front
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.240]   of the fence because every step of the work actually matters whether it's visible to the
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.840]   consumer or not.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.520]   And so this is obviously embarrassing to them.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.720]   And also I think it's more mostly it's firepower for people who just really want to find nasty
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.360]   things to say about Apple.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.480]   And so you can say nasty things about you can say that you can talk about things you
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.040]   don't like about the hardware.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.920]   And you can also say that this is legitimately embarrassing that they had such a not just
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.040]   a glitch but such a humiliating glitch.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:35.200]   But I mean even a V club they were talking about the reviewing this week's project runway
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.440]   in which one of the one of the one of the designers put a dressed on the runway that
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.280]   was inspired by color bars from a Samsung TV.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.560]   And of course they had to tie that into a joke about about it was a celebration of the
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.600]   Apple fiasco the first half minute half hour of the thing that is bad PR.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   That's not something that Apple likes but it's it's embarrassing when you see so many
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.200]   people talking about things that certainly matter but they don't matter as much as anybody
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   thinks it will.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.320]   I mean the last thing to say is that at the end of the day how much money is Apple making,
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.600]   how great is the demand for their products if both of those are high.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.960]   Okay though they're willing to take the hit for an embarrassing couple of embarrassing glitches
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   like that.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.120]   Yeah I'm with you I think they'll they'll take their licks and come out the other side.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.280]   And I mean look at if if look at you know the ridicule that we'd be heaping on any company
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.480]   that was in this position right if Google had a product launch and this happened during
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.320]   Google's live stream we you know everybody would be flinging just as much poo with them.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.360]   It's it's embarrassing but it's absolutely not the end of the world and I don't think
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.560]   it reflects on any company's ability to you know to execute their product.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:40.600]   I mean scaling demand this you know video streaming demand at this at the you know tremendous
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.440]   scale that a keynote like this gets gets watched that has got to be very very difficult.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.240]   Yeah I couldn't do it.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.040]   Yeah I'm not going to hurt any sales at all and and you guys are right it might be
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.280]   embarrassing but long story short nobody's going to remember this in a month or two after
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.520]   they've got their iPhones in hand and such.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.680]   You know Mike you brought up the whole China government and no iPhones for sale there.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.080]   You know last month there was something interesting that happened I don't know if everybody caught
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:11.160]   this the Chinese government a specific area of it told the carriers the big three carriers
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.880]   over there you guys are spending far too much on hardware subsidies for the phones and they
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.840]   basically said that you guys need to cut down on the subsidies by two billion dollars this
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.040]   year this was actually just China mobile alone and I'm wondering if Apple's playing a little
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.800]   hard ball here saying whoa the whole piece of the subsidy pie is going down we got to
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.280]   make sure we get our share.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.880]   I just wonder if that's playing into this at all.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.560]   Hmm interesting I wonder about that that is that is a good point and and one final thing
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.840]   on the Apple announcement we're going to talk a little bit about the iPhone the quality
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.760]   of the iPhone whether you should buy it or not in just a sec after we take a break in
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.140]   just a minute but one final thing about that the whole launch was the YouTube thing over
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:58.680]   blown a YouTube I'm sorry YouTube the integration of YouTube's album onto the phones which now
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:03.720]   people are publishing instructions for how to get rid of it and the whole YouTube on
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.440]   stage and the touching the fingers and all that kind of was this too much it's that
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:13.040]   is seen kind of like tone deft as a presentation metric and also as a rollout for this album
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   what do you guys think?
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.840]   Well you know Apple paid top dollar for the for the right to have to distribute this album
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.120]   right I've heard figures up to a hundred million dollars that Apple paid in order to
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:26.400]   have access to the app to have exclusive access to the album from a consumer perspective though
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.560]   I think more than anything else people were a little creeped out I think with this demonstration
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.760]   that Apple can they have the ability through the iTunes cloud service to sort of reach
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.840]   out and touch your library and put stuff into it I mean you know it's it's obvious what
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.360]   happened you know we regular iTunes users understand the technology you know we're tech
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.200]   journalists we know all this works but I mean for the average person it's like how
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.400]   do this get in my library how can Apple do this especially in the wake of the iCloud
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.280]   scandal regard you know about the nude photos and so on that was a little bit tone deft
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   on their part I thought well they couldn't have it they couldn't have anticipated that
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:06.040]   and it's also Apple has different Apple has a different relationship with its consumers
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.800]   that they really do consistently project this this point of view that look we don't care
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.560]   but what you do with our products we don't you know we're not here to be involved in your
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.880]   daily lives we just want you to buy our products and use our services I'm a little bit I was
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:23.960]   a little bit bummed by Amazon and Google music music services because now my my online
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.200]   libraries my cloud libraries are corrupted by songs I don't like that we're just simply
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   given to me for free and I should I should not I should be pleased that well if you give
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.320]   me 50 songs that I like four of them why should be pleased I got four free songs that I like
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.480]   but nonetheless I've got this sees music that will might come up on shuffle play that I don't
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.720]   like but you sort of expect that from Google you expect that from Amazon you don't expect
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.360]   that from Apple so whether or not that was something they should not have done it really
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.960]   does change the relationship a little bit maybe in some people's minds well in just a
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.080]   sec we're going to take a break in and just a sec we can come back and talk about which
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   is the best phone you can buy the best one that has come out or will come out this year
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.960]   but first I want to tell you about Scottie best you see this shirt right here this is
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:10.360]   called a Scottie vest tech shirt this shirt kind of a jacket like shirt but it's it can
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:15.680]   be worn as a shirt or a jacket has 13 pockets it has a zippered seam side pockets on the
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.520]   side has a bunch of pockets inside quick dry fabric perfect for travel I like to say that
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:26.560]   everybody who's able to work from anywhere other than an office is a digital nomad we're
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.800]   all digital nomads now because we can all most of us can work in various locations at
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.600]   Starbucks while traveling on airplanes in the car while waiting for various trains and
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.640]   buses and whatever it is we do and so we we need our clothing to match that we most of
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.720]   us wear jeans all the time and there's a little pocket in your jeans that exist for
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.960]   a pocket watch yeah once upon a time we used to build our clothes to to go with our gadgets
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.240]   and our technology and we still need to do that we just have a lot more gadgets a lot
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   more technology and that's what Scottie vest is really all about couple I think was last
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.680]   year maybe year before that my wife and I were in Spain and we're watching the Las
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.440]   Fias festival this is a big festival where they burn almost the whole city to the ground
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.240]   every year they build these big effigies and they burn it down and I was taking video
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.840]   and pictures with my iPhone there was a huge crowd of people and I had it on a stick and
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.520]   then I want to use my other camera so I didn't have a place to put my phone it had a big
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.720]   big special attachment on it was so it was too big for my my pockets and I handed it
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.120]   to my wife she put it in her purse and then somebody came up behind her and pick pocketed
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.600]   my phone and also had a wallet attachment so all my credit cards were in there everything
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.560]   was gone okay so this is one of the best use cases I've ever heard of for using a Scottie
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:47.760]   vest shirt if I had had this shirt when I was at Las Fias I would have simply put the
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.560]   the phone in one of the 13 pockets and I'd I'd probably still have that phone I could
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:56.160]   have sold it to Gazelle and so on and made a bundle but instead I had to replace it and
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.240]   that was a bummer interestingly Scottie vest has a pick pocket guarantee if you get jacked
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.920]   while you're wearing this device and something stolen out of one of the pockets and good luck
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.200]   to the pick pocketers they will give you a thousand up to a thousand dollars reimbursement
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.800]   for whatever it is that was stolen that's that's how confident they are and I've you
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.640]   know my wife and I live for a couple years as digital nomads we lived all we live in
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:23.220]   Kenya we lived in Greece we lived in all over Europe and spent some time in Morocco and
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:29.640]   so on and norms vary in terms of how you use technology in public for example in Greece
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:34.840]   I learned it was really kind of an odd thing if you walking around with with earbuds sticking
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:40.320]   out this white signature apple earbuds it's kind of socially unacceptable to walk around
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:46.040]   listening to podcast which you know I have to listen to podcast all the time and so shirt
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:51.060]   like this had actually has a all Scott almost all Scottie vest jackets and shirts have a
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:56.360]   way to hide your earbuds so the whole cable is inside the shirt and then you can just
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.960]   reach into the collar and pull out the earbuds and listen to them and they're very difficult
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:05.160]   to see places like London you have those white earbuds you're just a target for pick pockets
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:10.000]   theft on the street of iPhones is very very high because people can see from a mile away
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.640]   that you've got those white earbuds so Scottie vest is a solution to that as well and and
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.800]   Chad is actually wearing another Scottie vest device called a troppa former jacket yeah
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:25.660]   I have the troppa former jacket and holy mackerel is it awesome not only does it look super
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:30.920]   stylish it has tons and tons of pockets of course 22 pockets 22 pockets as any Scottie
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:36.460]   vest the zipper matches your hair it isn't it awesome I absolutely love this thing and
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:41.500]   the pockets not only are there numerous but they can hold sometimes some kind of ridiculous
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:48.820]   items I have my iPad inside of inside of my jacket here this also has a really cool feature
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.380]   that if say it's getting a little warm but you still want a little bit more protection
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:36:00.580]   also has a hood inside of this collar here I can actually pull off the sleeves if I want
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:08.900]   they're all magnetically attached and now I have a sleeveless vest instead of a jacket
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:14.700]   and then this is all just magnets and they'll just snap right back on it's a really really
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:21.740]   cool jacket I totally think the troppa former is like the coolest thing I've ever had yeah
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:27.340]   it's a cool jacket and of course you know we all every time every for each passing year
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:32.100]   the the industry presents us with additional stuff to carry and he was talking about a
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:37.580]   keyboard that he's got to carry he's also now going to be carrying a giant phone with
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:41.020]   all these mobile devices they don't get really good battery life so you're going to want
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:45.380]   to carry that that Apple watch charger somewhere you're going to need lots of pockets for the
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.380]   new world of wearable computing of course if you have these pockets and you're wearing
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.460]   these things then all your technology is wearable computing here's the good news Scotty

[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:26.380]   and you guys correct me if i'm wrong please but it seems to me that the the top five phones now for
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:34.300]   this year are the new moto x it's coming out pretty soon pre-orders go online september 16th we're hearing
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:42.700]   the hcc one m8 the samsung galaxy s5 of course the lgg3 and the iphone six plus are those the
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:49.500]   five let's just start with the five best of those the five best phones you can buy right now i would
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:56.300]   let out left out windows phone don't forget windows phone um yeah you can say if you want to go that
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:01.100]   way you can do the m8 windows phone version although i've got a i have a permanent soft spot in my heart
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:06.780]   for for the uh for the really colorful really nice lumias in fact i'm gonna i'm gonna break ranks and
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:12.380]   say that uh that my ideal phone right now at least me personally would be if i could get my hands on a
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:18.860]   lumia icon or a uh lumia 930 that's that would be kind of my that'd be kind of my perfect phone at
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.260]   this point which i know is weird because it's windows phone but you know i really like it what
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:29.180]   can i say all right what do you think Andy i would add the lumia 1020 to that list because it has
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:34.700]   something it has something that no other phone has which is that really that absolutely pocket
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:40.940]   cameras quality camera on it nothing when i when i did my big shootout a couple months ago but
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:45.980]   every single camera every single phone that i had in the office at the time and every other
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:51.420]   phone that i could get back for a loan for the shootout really was the iphone 5s and the lumia
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:58.380]   1020 and for very different reasons because they were uh the iphone 5s was the most consistent press
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:03.500]   this one button get a nice picture but the lumia could get photos that no other phone could get
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:08.540]   and windows phone has been making a lot of really big leaps this is a this is a banner year for it
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:15.180]   which this is this is sort of like the iphone 3gs year for windows phone where some features that
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:20.460]   make make it more practical and acceptable for more people are finally here still a pity that the
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:26.300]   software library is only adequate and not exciting still a pity that they're getting acceptance for
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:31.660]   it and support for it is not uh is not as good as anything you can get on the android or ios but
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:37.180]   i pretty much i pretty much agree with your lineup i would take the only one that i might not put on
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:42.860]   that list would be the htc one because that camera is just an on starter so you guys are both
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:47.980]   focusing in on the cameras which is mix law sense of the camera no no i i think that there's so many
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.340]   these other features are so similar to each other the screens are almost all exactly as good as the
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:41:00.140]   other uh individual features from android phone to android phone there's enough to the feature of
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:04.620]   android is diversity so that if you really really want something to be weatherproof great you can
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:11.420]   choose between the the sony or the or the or the samson s5 if you really want something that has
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:16.060]   haptic sense as a really good sensor array is very forward thinking and gets great android
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:21.340]   updates then you want to go for the motor roller so and so on and so on and so on um when for me
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:26.380]   the difference between the htc and the rest is that any reason that i would have for getting the htc
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:31.420]   there's a better reason for getting a competing phone and because not it's at the the camera
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.940]   becomes a deciding factor when you have so many phones that might be so close to each other
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:41.500]   it seems to me though uh andy that that essentially which are what you're gaining is a better camera
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.780]   in in some cases plus some of the other features you mentioned i mean these are hardware features
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.180]   for the most part and they're awesome and compelling features but you're pretty much giving up on a
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:54.380]   two huge universes of apps is that really a trade-off you'd be willing to make
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:59.580]   uh for some it would to be again we're talking about a constellation of great phones if i'm saying
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.860]   that if someone is asking me hey do you recommend a phone it's probably going to be one of these five
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:09.660]   probably not the htc but because i think there are other phones i could steer them into but uh if
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.660]   they're telling me that no i'm not a heavy i'm not the sort of person who keeps getting different
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:19.660]   games every single month or keeps trying to expand my universe with different apps i've my usage for
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:25.660]   phone is pretty much within the 65 to 75 percent of the universe bandwidth of it uh maybe they could
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:30.140]   be more attracted to the way that windows phone works which is a very attractive user interface
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:35.340]   i love their start screen and if they tell me that really this is the only camera they ever use and
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.140]   they're concerned they're concerned about all the times where they've gotten bad pictures bad once
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.940]   in a lifetime pictures from their iphone or from their previous android phone then i would sound
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:50.220]   them out on well what if i what if i told you there is a one only one camera that has all the
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:55.420]   features that these other uh phone cameras do not have you have to do some trade-offs in terms of
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:01.580]   its functionality as a an app running device uh but if that's not a problem for you you should
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:06.220]   at least take a look at it i i agree that i would not recommend the 10 20 or windows phone to
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.700]   the majority of people i would have to talk to them first to find out what they're looking for
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.100]   yeah kev for that what their expectations are kev and tofu what's it going to be uh what would
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:19.900]   you uh what would be your list and do you think the moto x the new moto x is likely to be uh to
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:25.820]   merit inclusion on this list absolutely that the moto x uh belongs on this list i have one in my
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:32.060]   hand right here the new moto x as you said it goes on sale september sixteenth i was a big fan of the
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:38.780]   of last year's moto x and i think that moto rola has addressed the the glaring gaps the few glaring
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:43.820]   gaps that the original device had particularly in the camera i'll agree with andy you know this
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:49.420]   is not going to compete with the allumia peer-view camera by any means um but for most people i
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:55.180]   think it's going to be perfectly fine um you know this this i think is the moto x that moto rola
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:44:00.140]   wanted to build last year but really couldn't because of the hardware chip cycle they just couldn't
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.940]   wait for qualcon and get their act together and therefore they had to put that special chip together
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:10.940]   with the uh with the processors and sensors and such um much improved battery life is good
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:16.460]   so i'm already i was already a fan of the moto x so i will probably be buying the current moto x
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:22.860]   but as lee said just before the show he's device agnostic platform agnostic i try to be the same way
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:29.020]   i did order an iphone six not a six plus and i also do own a windows phone uh five twenty
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.700]   lumi of five twenty which i'll probably replace with a five twenty one just to keep track of
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.300]   what's going on in the windows phone world why did you order the six instead of the six plus is it
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.980]   because you're a runner and you like to carry it with you when you're running that that's really
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:46.060]   a big part of it mike um i originally had the galaxy note two before that was cool if that ever was
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:50.780]   and uh i used to carry that everywhere i mean i i've used the i've been down the fadlet road two
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:56.380]   years before most people are going down it so i use those phones uh in fact the iphone six plus
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:01.980]   is very similarly sized to the galaxy note two that i used to use the thing is i have gotten more
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.860]   into running with my phone most of the smartwatches still require a phone so it's not like i can wear
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:13.900]   a smartwatch and go out and run and have a gps route tracked for me because i think only the uh sony
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:20.060]   smartwatch three has gps right now for android wear um so yeah so i stuck with what i wanted i
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:27.020]   wanted a larger iphone but i didn't need a a bigger you know 5.5 inch phone i want to ask a quick
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:33.500]   quick quick quick jim i just wanted to ask a real quick question on this too the so i went to the
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.420]   the moto event i i got to play with the moto x before i turned it over to andrew cunning m
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:43.100]   to do our full review on um and when our full review went up we had commenters posting in the review
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:47.260]   thread saying that they were disappointed that moto roller had actually made the maybe x bigger
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.540]   this time you know it jumped up to the the 5.2 inch screen and the resolution kicked up to 1080p
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.740]   you know if you've got both of them what do you think about the the shift from you know not quite
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.820]   as big screen to 5.2 inch screen is it really really noticeable when you have the two the
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:08.860]   pre the first gen moto x and the new one next to each other yeah that's definitely true um i i
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:13.820]   hope that we're not going to totally abandon people for whom right for whom this is actually kind of
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:20.220]   a perfect sized phone uh it because it really is a very attractive size it's just big enough i think
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:26.700]   without to let you really have the full phone experience without making you have to buy a special
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:32.300]   shirt to carry it around in uh so i i'm sorry that moto roller did not decide to keep that that
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:38.700]   size in the lineup um but i just wanted to quickly uh underscore what kevin was saying the the lead
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:43.660]   paragraph in my moto x review is that finally i have a good default answer to the question what
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:47.980]   android phone should i buy because like i said it is all about choice it really is about what do
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.180]   you what do you what are your priorities and hardware because you don't have to settle for
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.180]   only three models of phone for one manufacturer you there's a whole big world out there but now
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:00.220]   it is like is there chances are excellent probably 80 percent that the moto x is the perfect phone
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:05.020]   is the best android phone for you unless you want one of these three features in which think about
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:10.300]   maybe these are the three but definitely don't discount the moto x because there's so many advantages
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.380]   to it in so many ways i agree and the price is right and you can get it on
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.740]   i had a double check to make sure i i gotten that note correctly so that
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:25.340]   100 this 199 surely no is 99 all right then better incredible now let me ask you one last thing and
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:30.620]   we'll move on from these phones does the fact that we have wearable devices now many of us have
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.940]   many of us have android where and by this time next year lots and lots of people are going to be
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:41.100]   having wearable devices of all kinds does the existence of wearable devices change your
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:45.820]   criteria for choosing a phone should it change your criteria for example if you have a wearable
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.860]   device it does that mean it's better to have a larger phone because you can leave it in your pocket
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:55.100]   or women can leave it in their purse and you can interact with with the notifications and all that
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:01.180]   kind of stuff on your wearable device and does it reduce the appeal of something like the moto x i
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.900]   mean the moto x is great because it essentially functions as a wearable computer you you interact
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:10.540]   with it you talk to it and so on but now you can talk to your watch with a an android phone that
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:17.020]   isn't a moto x so how does the wearable i guess the wearable the existence of the wearable market
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:22.060]   now that it's completely mainstreamed i think by apple how does that change the calculation for
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.220]   which phone you buy we'll start with you kevin yeah that that you raise a great point might
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:31.420]   because all day long as long as i've had this moto x it's been on my desk when i'm sitting at
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.820]   my desk working and i'm using it like a wearable i'm speaking to it all day i'm not going to say
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:40.300]   the magic phrase because all of our phones are going to go nuts right now yep but um yeah i mean
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:46.060]   as opposed to my you know putting a wearable in front of my face and saying the same thing
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:51.100]   there's a lot of duplication here the timing of the wearable devices and the smartwatches is
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:56.860]   coinciding with intelligent sensors and software they can take advantage of always listening
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:02.540]   functionality on our phones so you know maybe there isn't as much need for that type of wearable
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:07.420]   device right now the other thing that you didn't mention i think is a very key point if you go
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:12.460]   with a smartwatch you're essentially starting to lock yourself into the ecosystem even more
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:18.620]   because the apple apple watch will only work with iPhones and the android wear watches they're
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:23.020]   not working with iOS they're only working with androids microsoft is rumored to be working on a
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:28.620]   watch that will work across all platforms but that's right now not not existing so there's a whole
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:34.380]   mother aspect to this hmm interesting well just sec we're going to hear from facebook and see
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.900]   what they're up to there's a lot of people complaining about facebook again this weekend
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:41.820]   we'll see what they're up to but first i want to tell you about go to meeting one of our sponsors
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:47.500]   today go to meeting is a is a suite of applications from citrix that enables you to communicate
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:53.100]   very freely and very with very high definition through video and all kinds of other ways that
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:58.380]   essentially reduces the need for you to go traveling and spend a fortune and and go through the hassle
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:02.620]   of flying around just to go to meetings in any sort of business strong communication and
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:07.900]   collaboration are super super important and you know if you're in sales or do anything that involves
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:13.580]   closing deals of course go to meeting can help you close those deals quicker solve problems better
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.660]   and essentially connects you to your clients your customers and your business partners
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:22.620]   and your co-workers in a way that's like super super efficient now with go to meeting you can
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:27.180]   meet with online as often as you like with anyone anywhere in the world and you can share
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:31.420]   schemes to review documents presentations in real time together and use the built-in hd video
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:36.540]   conferencing feature to see each other face to face to engage and connect i personally like go to
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.620]   meeting meetings far better than in person meetings because you can sit there and you can look at
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:44.700]   the information you don't feel like you're being rude to people when you're reviewing the documents
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:49.180]   over an electronic connection but when you want to make eye contact and talk to people in real time
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:54.060]   you can do that of course through the hd video conferencing feature and best of all it allows
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:58.380]   you to cut out the wasted time and expensive travel i personally think that meetings gobble up so much
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:03.260]   value for every company especially small companies when you don't have a lot of time to flush down
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.340]   the toilet with all this travel it's so much better to just have your meeting have this great
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:12.300]   meeting everything's recorded and then you can move forward and and stop wasting so much time
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:16.380]   and so much money of course we use go to meeting here at twit and it's like we're in the same room
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:19.900]   even though we may be miles apart some of the people we interact with on the other side of the
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:26.380]   world so try go to meeting free and see what it can do for you if you go to go to meeting.com

[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:41.900]   code twit and we thank go to meeting for their support of twit. well facebook has added again
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:48.220]   they they are being slammed in the press for their lack of privacy specifically a report on
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:53.340]   motherboards said that they talked to a security researcher who examined the code for facebook
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:59.980]   messenger and he basically said the code looks more like spyware than like a messaging application
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:06.140]   simply because it's harvesting so much information there. Lee you cover security a lot and
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.220]   security related things what do you think about this is this just facebook being facebook because
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:15.180]   there's something that we should all be concerned about. There's an old adage that I try to always
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:20.940]   keep in mind when looking at applications like this and that is to never ascribe something to malice
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:27.820]   that can better be ascribed to stupidity. I don't honestly I don't believe that you know there's
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.580]   there's an international facebook cabal that's out to steal everybody's information I think that
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:36.700]   this type of application is typically programmed on a deadline. The application developers do what
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.260]   they have to do in order to meet their goals and sometimes if less attention is paid to security
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:46.380]   than is then then is perhaps wise or prudent. It's often because of deadlines or because the
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:53.740]   developers simply don't care. I don't think that this is you know like facebook is out to you know
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:58.140]   look at every point on the screen where you tap they want to know so that they can record all of
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.580]   your tapping day. I don't think it's anything like that. I think that the people who programmed the
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:05.580]   app just didn't really give it the appropriate amount of security auditing or simply didn't care.
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:12.060]   And they also put in some kind of sort of funny comments in the code. For example they said do
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:17.900]   not use this feature or you will be fired. That was kind of an interesting thing and of course a lot
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:23.500]   of this stuff is being dug up by multiple researchers and you know one example for example Lee is that
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:29.180]   they're going after and they're actually recording or harvesting or capturing your Wi-Fi identifier.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:34.540]   I get the feeling that one of the reasons they're collecting this information is just in case later
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.900]   on they want to do some analysis on one thing or another. They don't want to close any doors.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:43.820]   They've basically gotten you to agree for them to do anything. Yeah absolutely. Remember also that
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:48.460]   that Google and Apple both are capturing the same type of data right everybody they use it to
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:54.540]   Google especially uses your Wi-Fi access point and geolocation in order to help better find where
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:54:00.460]   you are on maps. It's I mean all of these things like the you also have to look at with this particular
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:04.460]   app they've got access to some of the non-public API's according to the motherboard report because
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:09.580]   Facebook has such tight integration with the iOS core so they're given a little more access than
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:14.860]   you know random Joe developer would be. So I mean it's just really difficult obviously
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:20.220]   as as journalists we don't have the you know some of us do I suppose. Most of us don't have the inside
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:26.140]   knowledge on the you know design flow process behind apps like this. What exactly is Facebook
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:31.020]   trying to achieve by segregating this stuff out. I mean there's what we can theorize that they
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:35.660]   want to achieve but what exactly is the goal here and you know it's it's hard to say. But again I
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:40.940]   don't think that any of this I mean clearly some of these things are problematic and you know it's not
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:46.620]   a I'm not a personally not a I don't I'm not a Facebook user I have Facebook.com black hole
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:52.700]   in my local DNS I don't have an account. Don't use it. Don't like them. But I think that you are wise.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:57.260]   I know but I don't. Well thank you. I don't think that this is a purposefully you know
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:02.380]   malicious app that is out to you know snore up all your credit card data and have you know
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:07.820]   Facebook's steal your personal information. Andy Anaco how concerned should people be about
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:14.220]   Facebook's alleged privacy violations and the messenger of stuff in particular. Is this a concern?
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:19.420]   Yeah I think that anything anytime you talk about Facebook and privacy you should be concerned
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:24.700]   it's part of your responsibility as a Facebook user to really curate all of your settings carefully
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:29.340]   and make sure that this is that Facebook is working the way that you want it to because they
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:35.500]   just have a deplorable track record here and I don't it's I agree that it's it's it's kind of
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:43.260]   a rope to to imagine red red rogue people and it accolades inside of Facebook circling around
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:47.580]   a scrying pool trying to figure out what what brand of shampoo that you personally are using and
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:52.060]   being upset that they don't know what brand of shampoo you're using but there is such a thing
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:57.420]   as corporate culture. There is such a thing as there is a message that is sent to every single
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:03.180]   employee through the behavior of the rest of the company is privacy of user data important.
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:07.420]   Well not really it can be sacrificed for the greater good and we believe that sometimes the
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:11.580]   greater good includes the greater good of the users of Facebook that's why we make sure that if you
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:16.140]   put that if someone sends you an invite to something and you click well maybe I'll go we want to
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:20.140]   post that on your wall so that all of your friends know that you might be attending the roller derby
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:24.700]   in framing ham in two weeks time even though you just thought you're privately telling your
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:29.420]   a friend of yours who is a roller trippy in our roller derby team that you're going to try to make
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:34.700]   it this time. So you really didn't curate this stuff carefully in terms of when bugs like this
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:41.340]   happen again it's more likely it's an honest mistake but you would also I also would have to think that
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:46.460]   a company that takes privacy more seriously would already have had safeguards in place to say hey
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.380]   look if we're taking if we're taking a look at this kind of data we have to make sure we get
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:55.420]   sign-offs on this this and this we're going to add so much to our QA process for this feature to
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:00.060]   make sure that it is not possible to compromise people's data that way if you don't take that
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:04.060]   stuff terribly seriously you're definitely going to make sure that the program doesn't do anything
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:08.620]   that it's not supposed to do but you're not going to put up those five barricades against bad
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.780]   things happening so if you're going to ask me should I be concerned about privacy with Facebook
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:19.100]   the answer to that is always yes. Well you know it's interesting that I have the feeling that
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:24.780]   Facebook likes to say that they care about privacy and I believe that they believe that they safeguard
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:30.460]   privacy but they also harvest all kinds of personal data for all kinds of reasons mostly to improve
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:34.380]   I think they generally want to improve the app but I think the key point with Facebook is that
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:38.940]   they've discovered somewhere along the line that users don't care there are few vocal people on the
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:43.340]   press who complain about privacy violations and who really pay attention to this stuff but they
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:50.060]   have 1.3 1.4 billion how many users do they have now and the vast majority I'd say better than 98%
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:56.380]   I'm making these numbers up just don't care they just don't care at all they you know they just
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:58:00.860]   trust Facebook or they believe that they don't have privacy information they may not be thinking
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:05.420]   about how a malicious person might be able to put two and two together and figure stuff out or
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:09.980]   whatever but they've learned that people don't care and Kevin Tovall let me ask you this if people
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:14.940]   don't care if Facebook is in fact right about that isn't it okay for them to just harvest all the
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:22.700]   information in sight if the end is to improve the product isn't that a laudable goal well you know
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:27.340]   they're a business and you know they're in business to make money and they're going to do that by
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:32.540]   capturing this data would I say that it's all right no I wouldn't but I think you hit the nail on the
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:37.820]   head because most people these days I mean we've been using smartphones now for how many years
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:42.620]   we've been downloading app after app after app we're becoming numb to the permissions of what
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:46.780]   these things can do because we're just you know it's just part of our life now to download the app
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:51.500]   and go and you know and we're putting a lot of trust in all of these companies should we that's
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:57.180]   obviously a personal choice you know I would have to side with Andy and say you know we do need to be
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:59:02.380]   very cautious with with a company such as a Facebook or you know whatever whoever it is be
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:08.620]   at Google be at Microsoft be at Apple I think Facebook has an obligation to be forthcoming with
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:12.940]   what they're doing with data and when they make changes but again part of the problem as you as
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:17.580]   you're alluding to Mike is people either don't care or don't want to invest the time to care
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:23.900]   can I have a kind of a reactive mindset about privacy and I mean we've been trained to that
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:29.100]   right you you look at these corporations that are putting out large you know invasive applications
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:32.860]   that you depend on for for huge chunks of your life like Facebook and you trust that they're
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:37.820]   going to do the right thing and what your definition of the right thing is and what Facebook's definition
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:44.380]   of the right thing is maybe different it's certainly easy for Facebook to say trust us because Facebook
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:48.460]   you know speaking of them as a big monolithic entity they understand what they're doing and
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:52.300]   they know that you know whatever they're doing is ethical by their standards and so
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.820]   you know why wouldn't you want to trust us you know we're just you know we're going to have this
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.940]   app and you just just go ahead and we're doing the right thing we're Facebook trust us
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:04.540]   people are often very passive about their response to security issues and they wait until
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:09.500]   there are compromises or issues to adjust their privacy settings for example this is I think just
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:15.100]   one more thing and do you have a comment yeah I just want to say on the on the subject of people
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:21.260]   don't care it's okay for that to be a factor when people are informed and they understand the
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:25.660]   situation and they've decided that they that they don't care but if they don't understand that look
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:30.620]   the fact that that this motor this car company has put the gas tank this close to the bumper means
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:35.980]   that if there is even a minor rear-run collision there's a good chance that the fuel will splash
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:41.900]   into the passenger compartment and a very survivable accident will turn into a four-way fatality
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.140]   then if they decide that I'm still okay with or with the styling of having this with not having
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:51.180]   regulations about the gas tank or buying this car no matter what that's silly but okay you can
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:55.340]   allow them to do that I think that it's our responsibility to make sure that they know what
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:01:01.020]   their what the hazards are because again I'm not telling anybody to not use Facebook I
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:06.700]   I did a podcast a video a couple weeks ago where I decided to say nice things about each of the
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:11.420]   five what I feel to be major consumer facing companies and the thing I had to say that was nice about
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:16.540]   Facebook was that the fact is it connects everybody and the fact that you're you're you are a great
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:21.180]   uncle and you get to find out things about your nieces and nephews life that lives that they want
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:25.740]   you to know about without every without having to call every single day that is a good thing
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:30.540]   that Facebook does but so I'm not saying that anybody should be would be foolish to trust Facebook
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:35.100]   with us with their transactions all I'm saying is that they have to be aware of this is what the
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:39.180]   company does and this is what the philosophy of the company does and this is the history of their
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:44.780]   company and of the company and private information they're not evil but the idea of protecting your
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:49.900]   personal information and making sure that you're not exposing things to the company into the world
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:56.220]   that you would not want to be exposed that's not a very high priority so know about that and then
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:00.540]   what then take a look at the pictures that of your your nieces high school graduation party but
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:04.220]   definitely know what you're getting into if you don't care the price of not caring is knowing
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:08.380]   what you're not caring about yeah that's a great point and I get the feeling that Facebook is kind
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:11.500]   of similar to Google in the sense that you know there are two kinds of companies there are companies
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:16.300]   like apple which have this you know behind the scenes they form this grand vision and it's very
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:20.300]   clear to them what that vision is and then they plow forward toward that vision and then there
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:24.140]   are companies like Facebook and Google that throw spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:29.660]   and I think that Facebook and Google in both cases part of their model is to build a better
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:34.220]   user and a better user is one that can tolerate more invasions of privacy to a certain extent so
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:39.740]   they they both tend to push push push and see the pushing they they're sort of like blazing you
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:43.740]   know blazing into new territory in terms of getting people to accept different things in privacy
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.220]   standpoint as part of their survival strategy because you have to reinvent yourself all the time if
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:53.660]   you're in technology and this is how these companies do it and so you know in the case of Facebook
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:03:00.460]   they you know I have an ongoing thing that I do on on Google+ with my posts where every time they
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:05.660]   issue another apology I do a big post about it and list all their past apologies they apologize
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:11.980]   10 15 times a year for major things that really upset people and that seems to be the policy
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:17.020]   try anything if everybody freaks out apologize backtrack a little bit and keep pushing forward
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.700]   and that's that's kind of like they're governing philosophy and it it works for them they're very
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:25.820]   very successful and increasingly they're successful financially especially in mobile advertising
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:31.340]   there's another aspect to to to Facebook's criticism that's in the news this week a website called
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:39.980]   Queer Tea it's a network of gay and transgender people and also people who who are in drag and
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:46.380]   who have drag personas and that they want to put on the on Facebook as their name they have been
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:52.940]   apparently singled out by Facebook according to this article and and they've been ordered to
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:04:00.540]   to pony up their identification their passports and so on to prove who they really are in order
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.780]   to crack down on real names now you guys remember the real names controversy of a few years ago
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:11.980]   because both Google plus and Facebook we're requiring real names and Facebook recently excuse me Google
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:15.180]   recently backtrack down that said yeah we don't care what your name is anymore we're not going to
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.180]   try to force you to have real names but according to this article Facebook is sticking with the
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:24.380]   real names thing and of course this is an attempt to use Facebook for identity which is great for
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:30.700]   selling people things and and so on so what do you guys think about this Lee let's let's start with
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:37.420]   you is this what why is Facebook insisting on real names if in fact these reports are true
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:41.340]   can you guys hear me okay I have like a little video glitch a second ago yeah you sound great
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:49.740]   okay you know the the internet has traditionally separated people's real life identity from the
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:55.820]   identity that they have the option of portraying online and I think it's I think when a company
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:03.020]   decides that they want to you know sort of step it in police anonymity but they want to come in and
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:07.900]   and you know use their position as the provider of a network you know in this case Facebook
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:13.580]   to sort of like make sure everybody is behaving correctly and tying their online identity to their
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.380]   real life identity I think it's a massive invasion of privacy I think it's a terrible mistake I think
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:25.580]   that I think that this is a huge overstep it is it's not it doesn't do anything to stop abuse I
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:31.260]   think we clearly saw that with Google's real name policy and the tying of names with G plus and all
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:36.060]   that craziness that was supposed to fix YouTube comments and make life better and it just didn't
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:41.900]   Blizzard with BattleNet has in the past tried to do a real name thing that flopped terribly and
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:47.740]   and this is you know this is just another terrible idea I don't think that forcing people to identify
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:52.860]   online with a with their real name it serves anybody's interests at all except potentially
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:57.660]   you know advertisers who are building profiles etc etc this is this is a terrible idea it's an
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:03.420]   invasion of privacy and it is runs the risk of exposing you know the classic examples are it
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:08.060]   runs the risk of exposing victims of domestic violence or victims of crimes who want to you
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.500]   know still be able to communicate with others online but hide their identities it's it's
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:17.020]   I'm absolutely opposed to it I think it's terrible what do you think Andy do you agree with that is
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:23.420]   there any real benefit to to insisting on real names not really there there's conceptually a
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:28.540]   benefit we all understand how we we imagine how much better the internet would be if everybody who
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:34.380]   says something had to put their own reputation behind it but this is why it's so great to have
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:39.340]   technology that and that evolves I think five years ago we would not have considered the idea of
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:43.740]   their people who who need to have anonymity their people who need protection their people who
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:49.340]   wouldn't participate if they had to expose their true selves to the world and that certainly is
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:53.820]   their their prerogative and so I think as a society we have to ask ourselves do we want to
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:07:00.380]   exclude those people in the interest of hopefully the in the broader goal of a more rational and a
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:06.540]   more polite internet or do we simply say okay we did not think about that so let's figure out a
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:11.980]   way to make sure that these people can be safe and be happy and not feel as though they're excluded
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:17.580]   from this worldwide conversation this worldwide community and find a different way of making
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:22.220]   the making the internet a more polite place I think that if Facebook wants to stick to the idea
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:27.020]   of real identity good luck with that I think they're definitely wrong they're very ignorant they
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:32.220]   were not wrong to think that was a good idea to begin with but now that we know the ramifications
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:36.540]   of real identity for so many people you really have to accept that this is a different word that
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.900]   their world excuse me that someone else's world is different than the world that I myself might
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:44.620]   live in yeah and it seems discriminatory in the sense that if you you know let's say I want to
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:51.340]   call myself Kevin Tofel on the on Facebook they have no way that I would I would have
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:55.820]   a bask in the glory of being to Kevin Tofel but but they have no way to challenge that they
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:59.740]   they wouldn't challenge it that I would just be allowed to use somebody else's name or a made-up
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.500]   name that sounds like a reasonable name there are people all over the world like if somebody you
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:08.940]   know isn't from a relatively speaks a relatively obscure language somebody's from Swaziland or
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:15.020]   something and how does Facebook know if a certain name is really fake or sounds legit from all these
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:21.180]   different languages and so on and so people for example this this this case revolves around a
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:27.500]   person who I believe identifies themselves as male and the name is sister Roma so that's a case
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.740]   where Facebook would single that out and say wait a minute that doesn't sound like a real name
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:37.980]   and so there's certain types of names maybe OMG Chad for example I when the real name's policy hit back
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:43.100]   in the three years ago OMG Chad is the name I believe Chad you wanted to use on Google Plus
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.780]   Google said that doesn't sound like a real name absolutely it was the worst and because
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:51.740]   Google Plus was forcing you to integrate with YouTube and so the only way that I could get my
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:57.180]   YouTube name was to create a page and I had spent all this time creating my normal account my Chad
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:02.380]   Johnson account but I couldn't integrate that with YouTube because of the forced integration yeah
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:09.900]   that was definitely a huge issue for me and it didn't even have these lgpz concepts around it
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.660]   and and it's a pretty poor thing it's a pretty poor thing to tell somebody that I don't have a
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:18.540]   right to self-determination to say this is who I am and this is how I want the world to refer to
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:23.420]   me as and to say that nope we're not gonna let just choose your name that's that's poor behavior
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:27.980]   that's terrible now the other side of this of course is something that has to be mentioned now of
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:34.140]   violet blue really went after Google plus with the real names thing because specifically for
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:40.300]   transgender and gay people who who basically were being outed against their will by Google when they
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:46.060]   had the real names policy but the other side of the coin is when you have real names if they
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:51.260]   could really do real names people who want to speak up in public and still be able to smack down
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:57.340]   trolls and block them permanently real names are more a more powerful way to do that and so
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:04.300]   there's a there's a benefit to people who want to be public and and who want to be free from trolls
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.780]   because real names because right now since since Google dropped the real names policy
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:13.420]   you know trolls are popping up all the time to harass people with racist and misogynistic
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:20.220]   comments and when they're blocked they just create a new identity and come in as a different person
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:24.940]   happens all the time so that's the other side of this but I think I agree with all of you that
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:30.860]   the larger benefit is toward allowing people to use the names that they want to use and of course
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.380]   in Chad's case they fixed Google plus but it's too late for Chad you've already got too way too
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:39.340]   many followers now to really go back and change it right and to be honest it kind of killed Google
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:44.140]   plus for me I don't I basically don't use Google plus anymore because I have a public face which
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.300]   is OMG Chad which is associated with YouTube account and then I have my Chad Johnson account
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.700]   which is the one that I actually use and is connected with all the things on my phone and the page
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:58.060]   isn't really connected to the things on my phone I've they lost a user and a pretty prevalent one
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:02.700]   because I was really enjoying Google plus up to that point well we miss you I know you're on a
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:06.860]   little bit but you're not as high as you might have been and it's just really mostly auto post
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:13.820]   YouTube videos yeah yeah well um it is it is an odd thing well I'm expecting an apology any second
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:18.540]   now from Facebook and something of a revision of their policy but I think they're still going to try
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:25.260]   to have something of a real name's policy it's just you know Facebook just can do no wrong it no
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:30.460]   matter how many times they come and sort of hit people with unpopular policies like that they're
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.700]   still huge you gotta go there because everyone you know is on Facebook they have what I call a
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:39.340]   monopoly on everybody everybody's on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook and so I don't
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:43.820]   think people really care that much about the service itself that's just where people are so they
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:48.780]   they'll continue to dominate I'm sure well just second we're going to talk about something dear to
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:54.140]   omgchads a life which is the potential purchase which will probably be announced tomorrow
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:59.660]   by Microsoft of Minecraft and the company that makes it but first I want to tell you about
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:03.820]   another one of our sponsors which is Shutterstock now I've been blogging for many many years I've
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:09.500]   been blogging since before blogs existed and if you want to be blogging nowadays you have to be
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:14.220]   visual you have to be super visual you can't just throw text-based blog post because nobody will
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:18.940]   want to read them we live in a visual world well sometimes we blog things that are very
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:25.020]   abstract so how do you come up with a visual element for something very abstract an idea
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:29.020]   like privacy like how do you illustrate that with a compelling image well you do it with
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:34.460]   Shutterstock because Shutterstock is an amazing service for of course they have other things
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:39.020]   besides pictures but for pictures and blogging this is an amazing service they also have of course
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:44.940]   video clips and other types of content vectors illustrations you name it they've got all kinds
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:50.620]   of content and and 275 000 new images every single week so it's always being refreshed for new stuff
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:55.740]   but what I love about Shutterstock most I think is the search engine so sometimes you want to go in
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:01.980]   there and you want to something very particular you want to look for somebody who's using a computer
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:06.780]   but who looks sad and they're wearing orange you know you can go really specific on that kind of
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:11.580]   stuff and find images on Shutterstock no matter what it is you're looking for and you don't want to
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.340]   just grab a picture from the internet obviously somebody took that picture the photographer owns
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:19.980]   the copyright on that and you're just asking for trouble and you're also asking to be to have
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:23.980]   your reputation kind of tarnished by the theft of images and you don't want to do that and there's
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:28.860]   no need to do it a standard subscription on Shutterstock gives you 25 images a day I think that's the one
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:32.940]   that we have here at Twit so when we do blogging on Twit we can just go there and you know grab
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:38.620]   images up to 25 you'll never use 25 a day probably if you're a blogger but it's nice to have
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:44.060]   all those options you can download the image in any size and you pay only one steady price they
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:49.740]   have sophisticated tools you can search by color palette type gender even emotion you can you can
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:55.020]   go in there say I want to I want somebody who's happy that's doing xyz and and they'll show you
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:59.420]   hundreds of pictures for exactly what you're looking for and they have shareable light boxes so if
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:04.140]   you collaborate on your blog or your projects with someone else you can share your light boxes and
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:08.060]   say hey what do you think of these five images they have an award-winning iPad up I like to use
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:12.140]   Shutterstock on my iPad because it just looks so beautiful and it's fun to just flick through that
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:16.300]   very nicely and if you speak another language other than English they have multi-language
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:21.740]   multilingual customer service which is fantastic if you want to try it with no credit card I just
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:26.300]   start an account begin using Shutterstock to help imagine what your next project could be like
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.380]   and to save favorite images to a lightbox to review later and once you decide to purchase
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:37.180]   make sure you use the offer code TWIT914 and new accounts will receive 20% off their already low
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:43.420]   prices for image subscription packages and we thank Shutterstock for their support of this
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:49.980]   show and again I get so much out of Shutterstock because you know I go in there a lot and I post
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:54.380]   some very visual things on Google+ and what I've discovered I discovered a little blogging trick
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:15:00.780]   here's one of my blogging tricks for Google+ and you know the internet in general and other
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:07.180]   social networks has a very radically international audience sometimes we tech people talk about
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:14.460]   some pretty obscure concepts and they tend to be lost on people who don't speak English as their
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:18.460]   first language however if you don't get the international community behind your project you're
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:22.060]   never going to go to the What's Hot list you're never going to go to the make it at the top of the
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:27.660]   viral voting but if you use a really compelling image a lot of people will upvote just that because
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:34.140]   they love the image and that'll get you your post into in front of a lot more people because it'll
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:38.140]   be essentially upvoted so that's a little trick that I like to use on Google+ and I've gotten to
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:45.100]   the What's Hot list many times with a little nudge from a really awesome awesome photo well
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:50.700]   omji chat man what do you think about Microsoft buying Mojang I think it's definitely possible
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:58.220]   so this was a rumor that hit the Wall Street Journal last week where and they originally
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:04.700]   said that it would be two billion dollars was what they that Microsoft was offering to buy Mojang
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:10.780]   Mojang is the company that makes Minecraft which is of course a if you talk to any
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:17.420]   boy who is from the ages of seven to twelve he will absolutely know what Minecraft is
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:22.300]   I'm just not just twelve man I'm thirty six and I've been running a private Minecraft server
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:28.300]   perfect three years yeah absolutely I mean the mind share that this game has is unbelievable
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:34.140]   and there's a lot of different rumors on why this is a an interesting acquisition for
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:39.260]   Microsoft some people say that they want to make sure that they can lock down this game so that
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:45.020]   it's on Xbox or that it's on Windows phone that sort of thing or maybe just the IP the
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:50.780]   intellectual property of Minecraft is so powerful yeah it's it's really and do you think the community
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:55.420]   the Minecraft community is freaking out over possibly being part of the Microsoft umbrella
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:17:03.020]   absolutely now something that's not as well covered but is definitely an issue in the circles that I
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:10.860]   hang around in is Minecraft is also a huge platform for making videos on YouTube making
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:17.260]   internet entertainment somehow Minecraft was there at the exact right time and has the exact
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:23.180]   right features to be creative enough where you can create inner entertaining content on it almost
[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:28.220]   in endlessly so there's a lot of online entertainers and YouTubers who have grown up with this video
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:34.700]   game of Minecraft and they're very very sensitive to any large company coming in and saying well now
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:40.940]   you can't monetize videos and Mojang has been very lenient on on all of the creators making
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:49.180]   as much money as they want in contrast a company like Nintendo has basically taken money from those
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:55.660]   creators by saying well if this has uh Nintendo intellectual property in it we're going to take a
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:18:03.100]   version uh an amount of the ads that are placed on the YouTube videos that you create and that
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:08.700]   incredibly frustrates creators but Mojang on the other hand has been completely easy about it but
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:14.620]   if a sale to Microsoft happens that's that might not be the case and and people are really shaking
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:21.020]   in their boots there's channels that are solely devoted to Minecraft videos that are very scared
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:28.380]   about what this could potentially mean for for their careers basically yeah now now Lee you
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:33.660]   you're obviously a big fan do you think that Marcus Natch Pearson is a big sellout for considering
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:41.340]   this oh man poor notch so I mean I've been involved with Minecraft as a as a player and as a private
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:47.980]   server admin for for a long time since the end of 2010 and beating up on notch is kind of like
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:52.940]   the oldest Minecraft activity you can possibly do it doesn't matter what the poor guy does
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.980]   I mean he's made he gets stick from the community for having made a tremendous amount of money he
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:02.700]   gets stick from the community for having you know screwed the game up you know over and over and
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:09.500]   over again it seemed like for a while in 2000 late 2010 early 2011 that every addition to the game
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:13.180]   you know he was releasing updates very very frequently and every addition you know would break
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:18.460]   something and there'd be like image macros immediately after every new Minecraft release on like here's
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:24.460]   what notches screwed up this time I mean the guy has has come into it just a you know a tremendous
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:29.420]   amount of money over the past few years and he's done a really good job I think in my opinion of
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:34.460]   of of being responsible with the tremendous I mean the millions and millions of dollars that
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:38.780]   have come his way from programming this game he's he gives huge amounts of money to charities
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:44.060]   he's given a tremendous amount of money back to his employees I mean he's he's a great guy but
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:52.460]   dealing with a very rabid very active fan community for any game I think is very difficult and
[01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:58.540]   and and notch has gotten more than his share of poop thrown at him for for his you know for his
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:02.860]   success and in this of course you know that everybody says oh my gosh he's selling out notch is
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:06.940]   selling out well I don't think really notch has been that involved with the day-to-day activities
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:10.940]   I know he hasn't been involved with day-to-day Minecraft activities for a long time I don't know
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:16.700]   what how active he is really in steering the course of the game I mean he stands to make a
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:21.820]   tremendous amount of money from the sale if the sale happens but you know my impression is that
[01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:29.660]   he was so soured on you know on on just the sheer amount of hate he gets that he that this is if
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:35.580]   anything kind of a relief to him that he can sort of cash out and not have to you know just get beat
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:41.180]   up from 15 different directions no matter what he decides to do yeah I think that you know so just
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:46.620]   just the the consensus out there is that this is going to be announced tomorrow on Monday and
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:51.980]   that the reason Microsoft wants to do this is to really bolster its mobile platform and its mobile
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:56.860]   gaming platform I just hope that and I don't know if you guys agree with this but I just hope
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:00.860]   they won't wreck it I hope they keep it cross platform and keep it on all the platforms yeah I added to
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:06.380]   a Windows phone of course it's on Xbox and so on already this is an important game I think because
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:11.020]   this is a game that really excites a lot of very young people and it provides an alternative to
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:14.780]   Grand Theft Auto and some of these other things so instead instead of your nine-year-old out there
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:19.340]   beating up prostitutes and mowing people down with their with old Cadillacs or whatever on Grand Theft
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:23.340]   Auto they're building stuff they're learning how to build stuff and they're getting the thrill of
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:29.980]   creating things and and having a social network around something very constructive and so you know
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:35.180]   I think that if Microsoft does purchase this and again it looks like they will I just hope that they
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:40.620]   don't mess it up I hope that they invest in it and really get it spread out there because this is a
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:45.100]   this is a great thing well there are lots of areas that the fan community I think
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:50.460]   thinks that that Mojang has sort of fallen down in its development responsibility I mean you're
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:55.100]   right that it is a tremendously egalitarian game the server platform runs on you know runs on Mac
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:59.900]   and runs on Windows it runs on Linux the game itself runs on Mac Windows Linux consoles I mean
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:06.380]   it's it's a it runs on just about everything Raspberry Pi yeah yeah exactly but it doesn't have
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:10.140]   even still years and years after they said they were gonna do it it doesn't have a functional
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:14.540]   plug-in and modding system you've got to do weird stuff to add mods to it it doesn't have there's a
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:19.500]   lot of things that would enhance the communities involvement with it that it doesn't yet have
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:25.020]   and the promise of you know of a big a big company like Microsoft coming in and owning the IP
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:29.740]   the hope I mean is that they would come in and rather than you know closing it off and saying that
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:35.820]   you know Minecraft is an Xbox one exclusive from now on the hope is that they would come in and
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:40.620]   sort of bolster the development resources add the plug-in system you know help do the things that
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:44.780]   that the game needs that hasn't been done in the game for so long I mean that's that would be the
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:49.180]   optimistic thing whether that actually it's gonna happen or not I don't know I sincerely hope that
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:53.580]   that they don't come in and change the platforms the games available on that would that would kill
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:58.460]   one of the the most valuable aspects of the game because I mean as it is you know you go in and
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:01.820]   you pay your money and it doesn't matter what what you're running everybody can come in and
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:07.580]   play the same game the same share of world and you know build build stuff and dig holes in mine and
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:12.860]   everything it's it's it's great it would be a shame if it if it gets closed there's one last little
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:18.780]   kind of funny bit of information that came up on the subreddit for Minecraft two years ago
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:26.060]   not just tweeted his price that he would sell out for in his price two years ago was two billion
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:32.140]   dollars my price two billion dollars give me two billion dollars an Ellen Dorse your craft is what
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:41.340]   he said on Twitter so it was an omen two years ago so yeah so that's apparently what Microsoft
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:45.580]   must be paying and they've got it they've got many many billions to spend on this stuff and it
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:50.060]   sounds to me like a good move for Microsoft and if they keep it and support it like you say Lee
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:53.500]   in the way that you say that that would be a great thing for everybody and I hope they do that
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:59.100]   we'll see we're gonna find out what's what the deal is tomorrow and see if he got us two billion
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:05.020]   well the u.s. government threatened to find yahoo two hundred fifty thousand dollars a day
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:11.020]   way back in 2008 they didn't hand over user data essentially to the nsa we were just learning
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:17.500]   about this because you know the the stuff was uh uh looked sort of ripped out of the hands of the
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:22.460]   government uh and now we're getting all these uh formally redacted heavily redacted documents
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:27.900]   that are being unredacted and we're learning all kinds of nasty stuff roughly 1500 pages worth
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:33.740]   a secret and ultimately unsuccessful legal battle battle by yahoo to to resist the government's
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.260]   demand so essentially what happened is the government came to yahoo and said yeah we want all this
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:40.940]   data just hand over all this data and we know that there's some american citizens that are
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:45.500]   going to be affected but you know what where the government we or the fives a court we you have to
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:51.020]   hand it over and you can't tell anyone you're you're you're doing it and yahoo said that sounds
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:57.820]   unconstitutional I think that doesn't sound right and they said well uh unconstitutional or not
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:01.740]   you got to pay us two hundred fifty thousand dollars a day for every day that you don't comply and
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:06.220]   also they imply that we will make your life miserable in other ways if you don't comply
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:11.660]   yahoo ultimately complied and and microsoft complied and eventually everybody complied and then we
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:16.700]   led to the whole prism thing and all the nsa revelations that have been surfaced by edward
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:22.780]   snoden uh and yanaco this is uh this is another case where we're kind of looking at the ugly
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:27.340]   details this was during the bush administration I think both bush and obama administrations are
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:32.860]   at fault in all this um what do you think about this I mean I know you're not a constitutional scholar
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:37.980]   and and and so on but does this sound like something that the government ought to be able to do just
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:45.980]   go to yahoo and say hand over all the data I'm you know I have to circle back to what I was
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:50.460]   saying earlier about the apple watch I there's so much that I don't know about this situation
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:56.540]   um but that doesn't get that doesn't get in the way of my revulsion that the government can do
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:01.980]   stuff like this uh bravo to google for having to really be absolutely be thrown against a wall
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:08.140]   with a forearm against their neck before uh before handing over data like that um I really have to
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:14.460]   say that as an individual what I'm most bothered by is the lack of oversight I think that we have to
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:19.500]   as adults we have to get we we for generations we get used to the idea that the government is
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:23.980]   going to be doing a lot of things we don't understand but which are actually quite very much in our
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:30.460]   interests and and not only us but uh the rest of the country but the rule has always been that if
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:35.580]   the government is not telling me personally about this there is an outside age if one age if I don't
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:40.380]   know personally about what the FBI is doing the FBI has to talk to another agency and they have to
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:44.780]   be transparent to another agency who will be secret but at least they have to they're not
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:50.140]   completely in control and answerable to nobody what has concerned me the most is the fact that
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:54.060]   not only do you have to hold hand over this data but you also can't tell anybody you're
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:59.580]   handing over this data you also uh have no idea who does the nsa have to tell about what they're
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:05.900]   doing do they get do they have to explain to any other agency that as severe as this action is
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:10.140]   it is actually getting results here is the report that where we are required to file on
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:15.740]   an annual basis about the results of what we what we are doing uh the difficulty is that
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:23.340]   whether you believe that there is malice involved or not the primary responsibility of any government
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:27.900]   agency is to get funding for next year and not be eliminated uh and that's one of the most
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:32.540]   concerning thing of all whether it is uh something as big as this program at the nsa
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:39.020]   or something as simple as the need to uh keep uh making sure that telegraph wires can support
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:45.180]   morse code at a certain baud rate uh even after a certain need has surpassed there is a division
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:49.020]   at this agency whose job it is to make sure that they get funding for next year and they will do
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:53.660]   whatever they have to do to is to say that no no we are absolutely essential uh there's almost no
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:58.460]   agency agency who has ever said actually what we're doing is completely redundant we don't need to
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:04.140]   exist here is our here is our 11 billion dollar budget back to you and we 300 people are going to
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:08.380]   find something else to do with our time because we are a colossal and government supported waste
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:13.180]   of time that's what my concern is that there is never going to be a situation in which the nsa says
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:18.220]   that we don't need this information anymore there are better ways for us to achieve our goal of
[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:23.580]   keeping united states citizens safe uh that do not involve all this sort of stuff so if they get the
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:28.940]   budget to keep harvesting data harvesting data harvesting data there's going to be a way for them
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.020]   to try to keep that budget of harvesting harvesting data whether it's not necessary or not and the
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:39.500]   the the thing that happens that becomes most destructive is when 10 years go by and no one even stops
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:44.140]   to consider anymore if it's a good idea to keep harvesting this data it's because the reason the
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:49.900]   reason why uh someone is hired to go to this little pump house station in the water table and make
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:53.900]   sure that this little valve is turned to the left 10 degrees there was a good reason for them to do
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.460]   that 50 years ago now that pump house station doesn't exist anymore but this person is still
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:02.860]   required to go to that station and look for a valve that isn't there anymore or else there's
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:07.580]   going to be a problem that's the difficulty of all the sort of stuff so yes i'm it's
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:14.780]   i'm amazed i'm i'm immensely disappointed and saddened that this is the situation that we are in in
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:20.940]   2014 where i think a lot of us find ourselves wondering here is something that we could say that
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:25.260]   it's a joke or we're just interested in this piece of information we want to search for on the internet
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:31.500]   but if we were to do that would we attract the attention of an agency and five 10 years from now
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:36.300]   we get turned down for clearance or we get turned down for this or that and we have no idea that the
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:42.700]   fact is that we saw a news report on a wacky video that terrorists are putting up to try to recruit
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:47.020]   and so we searched youtube for that video but that put our name on a certain list that got
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:51.180]   connected to another list that was related to another piece of information based on someone's
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:56.860]   theory that somebody who drinks a lot of diapepepsi has been to these three cities in the past four
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:01.580]   months there's probably connection between that and other activity that's the sort of environment
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:05.100]   that they're creating and that's what makes me very very sad you're speaking of course of big
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:10.860]   data that's what that's how big data works essentially yeah i somebody the chat room said that the nsa
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:15.500]   is an american terrorist group i don't believe that at all i think that's overkill i think it's
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:19.980]   vastly overkill i think that i think they're really good intentions and i like to i like to
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:25.420]   compare the nsa to local police departments imagine how much better the police department could could
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:30.140]   could prevent crime and crack down on crime and catch suspects if they could just walk in anybody's
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:34.540]   house and search without a warrant if they could if they didn't have to read moranda rights to people
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:39.660]   if they could if they could you know sort of push the envelope of torture if they didn't have to
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:46.860]   uh testify in court you know all these safeguards exist not because we expect uh police people
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:54.060]   uh policemen to be to be bad and so on we have a social balance between our desire to to have to
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:58.780]   to solve crimes and to to put away the bad guys and also our freedoms there's a balance between
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:03.980]   those things i think we all understand naturally and which exists in the constitution very strongly
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.060]   and clearly and yet here's a case where there doesn't seem to be a counterbalancing force
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:13.500]   it's like oh we can harvest all this information so let's do it and who's there saying wait a minute
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:17.740]   there's a there's another side to this that that's an excellent and important point when i talk i've
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:21.900]   talked to lots of members of law enforcement about this topic going past ten years and they make a
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:27.820]   point that i absolutely respect that they have a mandate to preserve the public safety and they
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:33.740]   and this has been a consistent thing from different agencies different levels of law enforcement
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:37.020]   they said that we we really think this is that we are we took this job for an
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:41.980]   very very important reason we are here to protect the public safety and we are limited by the laws
[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:45.820]   that the public decides to put upon us and once there is a law telling we telling us we can't do
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:50.460]   anything we are not we don't we are not interested in circumventing that law because we are good
[01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:55.100]   people and this is the job we are going to do but if you don't tell us that we're not that we have
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:32:00.300]   to get a warrant to attach a GPS tracker to somebody's car and we feel as though this is a very very
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:04.540]   bad person and we can stop from doing these things by putting a GPS tracker on the car
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:07.900]   we're not going to ask if that's a good if that's something that we're entitled to do or not we're
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:12.140]   going to ask is it legal or not and if it's a they feel as though this again this has been
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:17.580]   consistent we feel as though if we are allowed to do this by the law and we do not do this and this
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:22.220]   is a way that we can keep people safe we are doing something wrong by not doing that because again
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:27.820]   they look to the law to tell them what they can and what they cannot do so if there's a defect in
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:32.860]   in regulation and restriction that's a defect that needs to be corrected because that's what prevents
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:39.820]   good members of law enforcement from doing things that that we I'm sorry I'm I need a
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.380]   backtrack on my use of multiple negatives they want they they don't they want to do good things
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:48.380]   they don't do any want to do anything that people don't approve of and they're cute as to what
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:52.860]   people do and do or do not approve of their behavior is what they're legally allowed to do so if we
[01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:56.780]   don't tell law enforcement no we don't approve of you doing this then they're going to keep on
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:01.580]   doing things that they think is in our best interests yeah absolutely makes sense yeah it does um Kevin
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:05.660]   Tofel do you have any comments on this I mean you know Lee of course is not using Facebook so he
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:12.140]   doesn't care but you probably do so your information is I'm sure in some database somewhere in in
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:16.780]   Washington or Utah or wherever they keep this stuff I'm sure they're listening right now I'm
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:23.180]   going to stop using Facebook and I will no longer drink diapensi um you know I can't disagree with
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:28.940]   anything and he just said I mean I do think that these these government organizations are trying to
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:36.700]   do the best that they can at their mandate and their job and it comes down to what's scary to me
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:41.260]   is that we still don't know everything that we don't know about this if that makes any sense yes
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:46.380]   especially especially if you're uh what was his name the former secretary of defense uh the known
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:50.060]   unknowns and the unknowns yeah ronselt go ahead Donald ronselt
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:55.740]   we I mean I hate to use that line but it's true I mean how many years has this been going on and
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:34:00.700]   we're still finding out such details like this um you know the uh who thing happened in 2008
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:10.300]   it's scary I totally agree with the whole balance the fine line of security versus privacy um until
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:17.900]   we really know what all of these groups are doing I don't know that we can put any any blocks in
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:23.980]   place or legal hurdles because it seems like we have to come up with defining every situation no you
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:29.580]   cannot do this specific thing to us to to you know to look at our backgrounds and so on and so forth
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:34.460]   and the internet is always changing so to to have all these definitions when the internet is changing
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:41.020]   all the time is it's very challenging and it's very scary I I don't know what kind of world my kids
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:46.140]   are going to be seeing in five to ten years are they going to be afraid to send an email to their
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:50.300]   friends and say one word that they shouldn't say because they may show up on a list it's
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:56.380]   it's uh it's very discouraging and disappointing right now yeah absolutely well in just a sec we're
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:01.420]   going to come back and talk about the death of mac world a print publication about technology
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:06.940]   but first I want to tell you about our sponsor Squarespace Squarespace is a you know I can't remember
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:11.340]   if I started using Squarespace because I heard Leo do an ad on this show I think it may have been
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:16.940]   the case a few years ago but I've been using Squarespace for a long time a whole family uses in fact
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:23.020]   Chad if you can throw up kevinadia.com this is my son's website he's getting married next
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:28.140]   month in about a little bit less than a month and you know they have a wedding website it's so
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:32.540]   easy to do he put this together I think he told me it took about an hour and a half to put together
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:38.700]   the entire site he manages a little bit here and there adding more pictures and just changing
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:42.860]   little things here and there are there are multiple sites and multiple pages excuse me
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:47.900]   on this site which is super easy to do with Squarespace by the way and including the ability
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:52.940]   for them to do their wedding registry which he put together himself very quickly look how cute
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:59.420]   she was when she was a little girl that's his that's his wife to be Nadia and you know Squarespace
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:03.580]   is the place to do something like this because you can take money you can sell things you can do
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:07.260]   all this kind of stuff which of course you do with a wedding registry the way it works is you
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:12.460]   start with one of 25 beautiful templates these this is world-class design that they have and once
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:17.420]   you've selected your design the one you like best you can modify it add pages take things out
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:22.140]   tweak it change the size of the font change the color of the font change the how everything looks
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:25.740]   you can modify it to your heart's content and of course you if you're a software developer you can
[01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:30.700]   really really modify it but if you're not you can go in there very easily with easy to use tools and
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:34.380]   anytime you want to swap out one template for another you can just easily do that and all your
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:39.660]   content stays in one place super super easy to use i like to use Squarespace just for fun it's like
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:43.980]   a video game to me a certain extent going there and see what kind of a website you can create
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.380]   sometimes i see some beautiful websites out there and i think you know i want to see if what that
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:54.140]   would look like as a blog or some other kind of website really fun to do and if you need support
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:59.260]   though it's available 24/7 via chat or email their tech support is fantastic truth is i'm only
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:03.740]   used at once and they gave me a really good answer right away so that was really refreshing they
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:08.940]   didn't throw me in some knowledge base somewhere it's also inexpensive Squarespace starts at just

[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:12.460]   mac world is no longer at least the print edition uh is this the end of an era
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:18.780]   what do you think yet yeah definitely because there has been one constant through line through
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:24.780]   the mac community that has remained consistent over the past god 30 years and that has been mac world
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:30.940]   magazine because we forget that the used to the mac world started off with actually getting pictures
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:36.860]   of getting the the first macs on the cover the day that the the day that the new macs were really
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:41.340]   introduced with mr jobs on the cover as well during during his nice suit and tie phase
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:48.060]   there were other magazines that came along most notably mac user and mac user became a force as
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:53.100]   well i was i wrote two columns a month for them for many years and then those two magazines merged
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:58.940]   so that basically they became the caretakers of two different sets of legacies and as other
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:04.060]   magazines came and went as other magazines that had been around and thriving when mac world was
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:10.380]   uh was still brand new uh they felt by the waysides and mac world was the only magazine that was
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:15.580]   still in print that had managed to maintain its mandate and its identity and a staff of people
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:19.260]   that have been working together for so many years that they really were like a really good
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:26.940]   infield of a of a championship baseball team so it's sad to see that uh the the magazine the
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:31.180]   the logo and the side are going to continue it's very very sad that so many of the staff were going
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:36.780]   because again you can put you could put that logo on pretty much anything but these this people in
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:42.620]   these people in the way they work together uh under the company leadership of uh of Jason
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:47.500]   Snell that was just a unique thing it was like the blues brothers band you know they had a power
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:52.860]   they had a sound that could turn goat pee into gasoline uh and now these people are split up
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:58.220]   hopefully uh the lot of them have already found new gigs uh they're certainly going to be doing as
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:03.820]   good work as they've ever done uh for these new organizations boy i'm more uh has been picking up
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:09.500]   some really really great staff uh over over the last few months so i'm not worried about these
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:14.220]   people individually because again they're incredibly talented and there's already a lot of the
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:19.500]   people who are not striving for their uh for their services uh are foolish uh chris breen did a very
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:24.140]   nice article that basically went through here's all the people that have lost their jobs or decided to
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:28.380]   leave over the past three or four months and just to tell it talking talking very very nicely and
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:32.940]   positively and accurately about all the work that they've done uh but it's too bad that there is there
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:38.700]   isn't um it's one of the what i would i guess what the bottom line after my stammering here is that
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:46.940]   there are very free publications that have authority based on their totality where there are a lot of
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:52.380]   max sites where there are nice sites but it really is all about what one or two people have to say
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:57.100]   and the investigative reporting of this person or the reviews of that person or what this person
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:03.900]   has to say it's very few there are very few places left where you can really say that i the name of
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:09.340]   this publication means that if mac world has reviewed the new mac pro i know they have done it with a
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:14.860]   certain amount of seriousness and integrity and thought for creating value for users they are not
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:21.340]   gonna let slip somebody who had a had a very really really active twitter feed and they asked him to
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:26.220]   hey what if we send you a mac pro for a month and then write something about it and then it winds up
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:31.100]   being you know two thousand words a thousand words about how much windows suck windows sucks and
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:34.780]   how much oh boy i can get my android phone to work with the pathen again i don't have an android
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:40.700]   phone because they're losers it's it's sorry to i'm just very sorry to see a resource like that go away
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:46.700]   yeah absolutely and of course the heyday of print technology computer magazines was in the 90s
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:51.660]   and in the 90s i edited one of them called windows magazine and that was crazy time because the
[01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:56.780]   internet hadn't really come up to replace the information and yet pcs and technology were very
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:42:02.300]   new to a lot of people so people turned to physical print paper magazines in huge numbers we used to
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:07.900]   publish bigger than 400 page issues we had a editorial staff just the editorial staff not sales or any
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:14.220]   of the rest of more than 60 people and pc mag of course was the larger publication in that space
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:20.700]   they had a staff of 122 people in the in the late 90s and they had you know they they did 400
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:27.180]   500 600 page issues and they were twice monthly so it's hard to remember that my entire my entire
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:33.260]   tech life in the the early to mid 90s was defined by additions of pc magazine yeah that was like
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:37.420]   always the highlight of of the month was like oh i'm gonna we're gonna get my my parents are gonna
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:40.460]   drive me to the mall and i can buy the latest pc magazine it's gonna be so cool
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:44.300]   yep absolutely and it's you know now you just search for information and you get it
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:50.460]   yeah so it's kind of an end of an era it's it's a it's a you know it's i think the idg deserves a
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:54.780]   lot of credit for keeping it around for as long as it did they recently closed the paper or the print
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:59.740]   version of computer world i think that was it within the last year i write for the digital edition
[01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:03.820]   but of course the internet is so compelling you can search you can promote it on social networks
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:07.660]   you can have live links you can do all these things that you can't do in print so it makes a lot of
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:13.260]   sense that print goes away and i hope that whatever they do with the brand uh honors the legacy of
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:19.500]   macworld and uh you know i think uh we can all agree that it was uh it is the end of an era uh any
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:24.060]   thoughts on this uh kevin toffle it's just sad to see for all the reasons you guys have have
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:29.900]   mentioned uh you know i i grew up the same way you know go into the the bookstore to go get the
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:35.100]   latest computer magazine heck i remember i was still in uh probably middle school getting like
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:40.860]   computer shopper which was the ginormous thing yeah so you'd look through and that's you know i bought
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:47.260]   my Commodore 64 through there for crying out loud way back i mean yeah it's it's just sad to see i
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:52.460]   guess you could say it's one of those things that i guess you expect to see happen over time the
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:57.660]   internet has disrupted everything quite honestly and now with the the rise of tablets people buying
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:02.700]   digital editions of their magazines that's putting pressure on all these print publications as such
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:07.100]   but you still don't want to see it for certain brands and this is just one of those brands that
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:11.740]   it just kind of you know tears at your heart are you guys particularly galled by the fact that
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:18.780]   that this staff cut took place the day after the entire staff went and killed themselves
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:24.140]   covering doing bang up coverage on this gigantic apple event that happened i mean uh just seems so
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:29.260]   maybe maybe it's not unexpected i've worked at enough big companies to know that you know the
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:34.860]   the bottom line is the bottom line but man that just thinks time time i'll just i'll just i'll just
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:39.020]   say that wouldn't have been too bad if the Beatles had never been able to get on that rooftop and
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:44.060]   play together in public one last time so i hope they i hope they don't feel abused but i'm glad that
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:50.220]   they were able to go out with one last emphatic concert that shows here is what this band can do
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:54.780]   and here's how badly we're going to miss them that's a great way to put it Andy although they would
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:57.820]   have had to have known they should have known that this was happening that would have been a
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:03.740]   better way to do it they could also have networked at the at the event looking for other jobs well
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:09.500]   um if you missed any twitch shows this week you blew it and i think Chad do we have a list of the
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:13.660]   things that were here's what you missed this week if you didn't see all the twitch shows hello

[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:38.940]   a lot more secure than email chip in system this is perhaps more important from apple's point of
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:45.580]   view than anything else absolutely met break weekly and he is in coopertino eyes bulging for the apple
