[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   Alright, this is the slate revenge of the screets April 17th number one
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480]   Take one
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.480]   Yeah
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:34.800]   There's Patrick
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.320]   Yeah, so say hello to Kevin Rosen Robert
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.800]   Hi Kevin, hi Robert
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   Hey Patrick, hey, that's cool
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   How you doing Patrick if you're exhausted or did you get some sleep?
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800]   Oh, I got lots of sleep
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.800]   I got like 15 hours of sleep Friday night
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   Patrick, what did you do? You drove from where?
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.800]   Drove from here in San Francisco out to Denver, Colorado
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.800]   Not stop
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   No, I stopped in fabulous West Wendover, Nevada
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.800]   And why did you do this?
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.800]   It was actually the two things, it was made up of the fire guys
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.800]   To go see a premiere of Dust Glory
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   Which is an off-road movie by Dana Brown, the guy that did "Step in the Liquid"
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   He did a, basically he put 90 cameras down in the Baja 1000 a couple years ago
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   And captured 250, 300 hours of video and turned it into a two-three hour movie
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   Which is pretty impressive
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   And it turned out it was showing for Centrix Financial who's some people we've supported in racing with wide open Baja
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   And the Baja 1000 this year and they actually flew out Dana Brown and his co-producer
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   And some of the key people in the film to talk to everybody after showing the movie
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   Which was kind of a trip
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   So anybody who's curious what Patrick Norton is doing these days, it's driving in the dust
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   Now, mostly it's writing for extreme tech and extremeipod.com
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   Wait a minute, there's something called extreme iPod?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Extreme iPod, what is that?
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   Well, I'll give you three guesses Leo
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   But how extreme can you get with it? What's the most extreme you can do with an iPod?
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   Well, gee, we actually are just starting up a contest
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   Getting people's pictures in of stuff they're doing with their iPod and wherever they're doing it
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   And I expect to be deeply offended and I'll let you know and forward anything interesting to you as soon as I am
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   Oh, that kind of extreme, that's very different
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   As long as we're catching up, what's up to these days Robert? Everybody knows Robert Heron
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   As the crazy lab rat who's specialized in video
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   And would come on the show and with his whacked out hair and tell us the latest thing in video
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   You're not on TV though these days, yeah?
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   No, not these days. I am working though for extremetech and PCMag.com
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   Do in the same kind of thing?
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   Taking over their HDTV lab actually
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   That's fun putting together a new facility and at the moment just grinding through some of the latest and greatest in HDTV
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   So the only person who's gainfully employed in television here would be Kevin Rose
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   Hey, you are too Leo. Oh, that's right
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   That's right
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   But it's in Canada, that doesn't count
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   No, it counts
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   What's going on in the G4? What is the name? What is in the show now? The attack of the revenge of the show?
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   What is it?
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   No, they've changed the name obviously the screen savers is no longer but it's now called attack of the show
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   You sound so thrilled about this
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   Oh, yeah
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   No, I want to call this podcast the revenge of the s***ers
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   You think Charles Hirschhrine's gonna sue me if I do that?
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   Oh, yeah, you're probably gonna get a nice little cease and desist or something like that too
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   I'm sure Leo.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   I'll call it trots, then that way nobody will know what it is
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   There you go.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.800]   How about that?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   Excellent.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   I like that idea.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   So, Kevin is also working on his own
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   I want to tell you what's called the vanity project. It's his own offline TV show.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   Tell us about system.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   System?
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   No, it's S-Y-S-T-M dot org
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   and it's basically system is going to be kind of an old kick back to the old screen savers where
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   I focus on one particular subject per episode
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   So it may be, I don't really want to give away our future episodes
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   but it may be something that has to do with a hardware hack or some really cool open source
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   Linux distribution that we really want to show off.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   And how long will the episodes be? I mean
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.800]   Between 15 to 20 minutes per episode.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   Cool.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   Cool.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   It's gonna be you or who's gonna be involved in this?
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   So far, there is a few people involved.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   Dan Hubert, of course, is going to be kind of co-hosting it with me.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   Cool.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   So this is kind of the successor to the broken or is it kind of different?
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   Well, we still want to go do another episode of the broken.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   But this is kind of the grown up broken a little bit.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   More mainstream?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   More mainstream, you know, not no 40s or anything like that.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   So we're talking about the malt liquor that you began.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   That's right.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   First episode with the maidens, which means that we could never play the full episode on the screen savers.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   That's right.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   It has a cut before they broke out the 40s.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   But yeah, pretty much it's gonna be a...
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   It's just gonna be a lot of fun.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   It's just...
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   Yeah, we have to like...
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   I remember a couple times where we were showing clips of the broken.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   We had to make sure there was no...
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   There was no 40s in there.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.800]   But yeah, that's gonna be a lot of fun.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   Well, I know a company, a little company up in Toronto that would love to distribute a television version.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   If you...
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   I mean, you don't have a problem with them buying it from you, do you?
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   Hey, that sounds good.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.800]   We're pretty much opening anything.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   I think they're interesting.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   I mean, what the main thing is though, is that we want to keep it also online.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   We want to have that online component because we know that, you know, even with G4 or the old tech TV,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   you were only limited to the people that could actually watch.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   Right.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   And they had the digital cable or the extended digital cable or whatever you needed.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   It's nice not to have that seven minute or whatever it is, four and a half minute limit too.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   I mean, we can go really geeky and really take our time and not have to worry about, you know,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   breaking it up or dumbing it down any.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   Show of hands.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   Anybody was anybody frustrated by the limitations of tech TV?
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   No.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   No, you weren't.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   Not at all.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   You miss it?
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.800]   I miss that environment.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   I do too.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.800]   It was great to be able to go in the lab and see you guys and talk to what you were up to.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   After seeing first-hand how TV is really just about numbers in Los Angeles, it was...
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   It makes me realize how special that whole environment was we had in San Francisco at that time.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   Yeah, we were ignorant.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   Yeah, but you know, ignoring San Francisco at the end, we were actually getting it together
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   in such a way.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   It would have been nice if we could have extended it for another year just to see what would have happened.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   I mean, Robert, you saw, I mean, we worked together in L.A. here.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   And it was just...
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   It's a completely different environment down here than it was in San Francisco.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   Like what?
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   Well, it seems to me that our owners at the time when we were tech-TV just understood tech.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   You know, they understood that there was actually a market for it that people really enjoyed
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   getting geeky in certain areas.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   And it was the fact that we were constantly having to trim a lot of that out.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   And it was just to the point to where you really weren't even getting enough information
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   to make it worthwhile.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   If that makes sense.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   Is there something if you had a free reign right now on "Attack of the Show"?
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   Is there something...
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   What's the topic you'd like to cover right now that you couldn't cover?
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   Or is there one thing?
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   Well, what they really want me to focus on "Attack of the Show" right now is kind of, you know,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   some of the dark tip stuff that I've been doing in the past.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   But, you know, there's a lot of stuff that even though we did it at tech-TV that we can't do any longer.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   Like, a good example is, you remember, Leo, when I built that shocking Xbox controller?
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   Yeah, that was great.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   It was fun because you could play with your friends and you would actually fill the pain
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   because it was shocking sensors in the handles.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   But I want to, you know, even take that a little bit further and kind of do a nice little shocking chair
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   where you could be sitting there and actually have more shock points.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   It was just a fun project that I wanted to do, but we got denied.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   We can't do that.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   You know who invented the electric chair, don't you?
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   No, I don't.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   Thomas Alva Edison.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   Really?
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   Yeah, he supervised the first execution.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   His thought was this will be a more humane way of executing people.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   The only reason I know this is because our old buddy Hank Kaiser, who now works up here doing shows for the History Channel,
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   is producing a documentary about Thomas Edison and the electric chair.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   And he actually sent me an email saying, "Did you know that you look like the later in life the older Thomas Edison?"
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   And which I was very flattered by.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   And would you like to play him on the History Channel special about Thomas Edison and the electric chair?
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   I said, "You bet.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   Unfortunately, the schedule didn't work out.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   I was in Toronto when they had to tape."
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   So, or maybe...
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   Oh, I think I actually ended up watching that episode.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   That'd be fun to be Thomas Edison.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   That's a...
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   There actually wasn't a word for "electrocution" back in the day, so Edison immediately came out with the word "being Westinghouse."
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   Was this because he hated Westinghouse?
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   Oh, Westinghouse is an intestinal and basically perfected the AC system that he used today.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   His DC system was harmless.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   His DC system was harmless, but it was limited in range where you would literally have to have a power plant every half a mile to a mile.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   Oh, yeah, 12 or 15 yards.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   You've been Westinghouse. That's hysterical.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   Of course, George didn't appreciate that and made sure that didn't come to be a common term.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   Well, as it turns out, unless you think having flames spurt from your ears is humane, it's not the most humane way to execute people.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   Oh, I mean...
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   I mean, I'm wondering none of us have been executed, and none of us have been executed, you know, in a hands-on testing environment with some repeated attempts for comparison.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   I mean, who knows what the most humane version is?
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   It's not too late, Patrick. I mean, our lives aren't over yet.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   We may have a chance.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   Someday, we may have a chance.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   So, you know, I don't know exactly what this show, this Revenge of the Screen Saver is going to be.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   I mean, it's fun just to sit around and talk.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   And I'd love to invite more people. Right now, we're using Skype to do it, which seems to work fine.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   We've got four people, and the quality's good, you know.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   When I realize we're all the background noise you're hearing on Mayan's coming from, I have this noise box sitting right next to the mic.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   So, I hear that one.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   I should have just put it on my notebook.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   How many fans are in your computer?
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   I think just two.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.800]   Two?
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   But they're pretty loud.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   Actually, the loudest fan you're probably hearing is the one on the motherboard itself.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   You might be getting some from me. I'm not recording my audio, though.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   The audio that comes, you may be hearing something different from me.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   You are hearing something different from me than you'll hear on the broadcast, because I record.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   Nobody cares about this, but I'll just tell you, I record directly from a real radio mic,
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   so that I sound good while you guys sound like you're, you know, like, underwater.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   The rest is going to be, "wah, wah, wah, wah, wah."
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   Next up on the podcast.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   Hey, there's certain privileges accrued to the person who owns the mixer.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   You know that from your days in rock and roll, you know?
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   You get the power of the board.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   So, any news stories or anything in the current events that are of interest to anybody?
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   Anybody want to mention anything that's bugging you these days?
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   Patrick, what's bugging you these days?
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   Actually, you know what's been bugging me these days?
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   What?
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   So, I'm finally going to switch cell phone carriers.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   And something I've been putting off for, you know, three, four, maybe eight years now.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   You've been sprint as long as I've known you.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   I've been sprint since I've basically bought a cell phone because there are no working
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   payphones in San Francisco.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   That's right.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   I should, when we were in Paris...
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   And they saddled me with a pager.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   When we were in Paris, I showed my son, when we were in Paris, I showed my son the, uh, uh,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   they had a payphone.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   I said, "look, look, Henry, remember this day.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   You won't see many more of these."
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   You're right.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   Who needs them now?
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   You need to turn the, uh, the level down justice.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   Am I too hot for you?
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   You know what I was doing?
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   I was talking into the microphone.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   Let me sit back.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   Well, no, what happened is there was like, it was like, so I was in Paris with my son
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   and I went, "hey!"
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   Hey!
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   Fabulous.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   Okay.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   I was just saying that I saw him at payphone.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   I said, "but look at this, this is history.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   You ain't gonna see many more of these."
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   They still have them in Europe.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   So, are you, have you decided who you're gonna go with?
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   I think I'm actually gonna end up going with Verizon.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   People seem to agree that's the best carrier.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   Verizon is by far the best carrier, no doubt.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   Well, the other thing is, is their coverage, especially compared.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   I mean, the one thing I like about Verizon more than anything else is their coverage map
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   is actually readable.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   Well, Singulars has gotten pretty good too.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   Well, you laugh, right?
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   But if you look at Sprint's coverage map, it's the funniest thing you've ever seen.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   It's basically three shades of greenish blue.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:31.800]   And, uh, and if you're not, like, looking at it on the right particular page off of the Sprint thing,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.800]   it's about 300 pixels across.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   So, you're looking at a map of the entire United States and there's a green blob pretty much
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   between Toledo, Ohio and Chicago.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   And there's like a green stripe from Boston down to DC.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   It works.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   It just works.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   You know, a couple green blobs, like Florida's a green blob, Dallas is a dark green blob.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   And then you get into, like, California.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   And you can see the I-5 corridor.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   And then you can see, like, I-15 up to Vegas.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   And then you get, like, the rest of Nevada, Northern California, are two subtle shades of green.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   And you can never tell, like, what's actually covered and what actually isn't covered.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   So you're-
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   Which is the sidekick too?
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   I have a sidekick too with T-Mobile.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   And I love my sidekick too.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   But, you know, it's-
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   I like the sidekick.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   It's such a lockdown environment.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   You know, you can't just put any arbitrary software on there.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   It has to be stuff with T-Mobile sold.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   You can't put any ringtones on there but what T-Mobile sells you.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   On the other hand, I've got an SSH application that allows me to log into my server and I can run any
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   command line Unix applications.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   Yeah, but Leo, how fast is that, really?
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.800]   It's not too bad.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.800]   I've tried it on the old- I tried it as a station.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   It seemed to be extremely slow with T-Mobile.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   Well, you have to be patient.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   You know what- you- where Verizon has a real advantage and it's not in San Francisco but it is in LA.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   They have an incredible high speed, you know, that EDVO network is-
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   Is- is incredible.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   Have you tried that down there, Kevin or-
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   No, I haven't tried that.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   I- I actually am having some cell phone problems as well.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   I have the, uh, the T-0650 from Sprint right now.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   And I just- I hate that phone.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   Pat, do not buy that phone.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   I know you were thinking about it.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   Kevin, you've returned your Trio- 600.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   You didn't like that one either.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   Why'd you go with a 650?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   Well, I just thought the- the resolution of the screen is so much better and then it has a better camera.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   I thought it would fix a lot of the issues that I had with it before but, uh, I just don't really like it.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   It's too bulky.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   It's just- I don't know.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   It feels like carrying on a brick with you.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   Well, that's the same thing with the sidekick too.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   It's a little clunky.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   On the other hand, it's got a real keyboard and, uh, I mean, I can use AIM.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   Uh, you know, I always have AIM running and I mean, that's pretty cool.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.800]   It's- it's, you know, the- the sad thing is it's designed for, you know, people your age.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   And so you have all this hip ringtones, a lot of rap and stuff.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   Nothing for- you know, where's the Joni Mitchell?
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   There's no Joni Mitchell ringtone.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   None of them for people my age.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   Oh, it's James and-
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.800]   How about AIM, Leo?
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   You like rap.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   I do.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   I like rap.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   You know, you could create a Joni Mitchell ringtone.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   No, you can't!
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.800]   No, that's the point.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   That's the point is that they have locked the sidekick down so tight that you are- not only- well,
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.800]   that- look at what happened to Paris Hilton.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   They have all your data, so if somebody hacks their servers, you're dead me, you know?
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.800]   So I take- I make sure I don't take any dirty pictures.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   Or if I do, I erase them right away.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   That's good to know.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   Yeah, thanks for sharing, man.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   I appreciate that.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   So the thing to look at, Patrick, is this, uh, is this high speed connection and this- then
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.800]   now they have Verizon has a thing called VCast, which is real, uh-
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   What?
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   There's not much- I mean, the VCast is a great idea, but we're about six months or a year
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   before it starts getting really interesting.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   Um, I mean, 'cause we've been kind of tracking the 3G stuff that's been coming out on extreme
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   tech and the emergency- excuse me, not emergency- emerging technology sections.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   And it's like the- the stuff that, uh, that, uh, Verizon's offering, the high speed stuff,
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   is spectacular, but right now they're in, I think, 30 markets.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   Yeah, you have to be in a market where they have it.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   That's the perfect way.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   You know, so if you travel in like 30 major cities, none of which is San Francisco, you're
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   in great shape.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   Right.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   Especially if you stay in the downtown area.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   Well, that's why I was asking Kevin, 'cause it does support LA, uh, you know, it's weird
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.800]   towns too, I think like Syracuse.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   I mean, they're- they're slowly rolling it out.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   I mean, they're- they're- I think they're actually going to try to get it out to the, uh, like
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   at least a hundred markets by the end of 2005.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   Well, I haven't seen it.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   I was- that's why I was, uh, wondering, but I've heard good things about it.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   If you're in the right market, you know, and, uh, and I guess that's the key.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   So you're going to go with plain old Verizon, then.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   You're not going to worry about the data.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   We go with plain old Verizon.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   What do you use, Robert?
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   I'm a next-till person, personally.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   Next-tail.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   I have to have direct connect, so.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   But they were just purchased by Sprint, so.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   You know, I think, pardon me, but isn't this walkie-talkie thing stupid?
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.800]   It has some stupid functionality to it in terms of the fact that-
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   Everybody can hear what you're saying!
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   That and everyone has that same double chirp.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   It's so annoying.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   There's no way to change that, and there's no way to, like, lower the chirp without lowering the person's volume at the same time.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   Don't you think, though, that it- is there anything- I mean, look, it's bad enough to-
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   And being rude with the cell phone period is just wrong.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   There are plenty of alternatives out there, especially like a boom microphone is awesome, where you can just whisper into it.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   Oh, you like that?
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   The boom?
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   Actually, it's just a lucky design by a very clever engineer.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:34.800]   It has, like, analog voice cancellation built into it, and you literally can whisper into it, and the person next to you is totally not interrupted at all.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   That's depressing.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   You know, they gave me one when they first came out, and I accidentally stepped on it, so.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   They were fragile.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   That is-
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.800]   That is-
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   I never got to try it.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   They were fragile and expensive.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   And it's been broken, in my case.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   Oh.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   Dead in the water now.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   But I swear by a direct connect, just for the ease of just seeing if someone's there, it just makes it-
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   It makes it-
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   For me, my community of friends who use it, it's the simplest thing for me.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   No, I just pray that the FCC and the FAA don't approve cell phone use on airplanes.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   Not because of the technology issue or the wireless issue, just who wants to sit in an airplane full of loudmouth boring people for six hours?
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   You better get used to it, because it's coming-
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.800]   Oh, man.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.800]   It's a engine.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   It's a nightmare.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   That's where I plug my etymotics in and I turn the Metallica onto the full volume and I just pray the plane doesn't go down, because I won't know.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   Does that begin here?
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   It ends here headphones?
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   Yeah, the ones that make you gag.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   Oh, I love this.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   [Laughs]
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   But at least I don't hear the cell phone- I'm gagging, but I don't hear the cell phone conversations.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   I don't-
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   Yeah, I don't-
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.800]   Has anybody used these Bose noise canceling ones?
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   I don't think they're very good.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.800]   I don't like them.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   No, the audio's kind of in and I'll be honest with you, I always feel like my head's going to explode when I have any of the noise canceling headphones.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   It's like hearing cotton or something, huh?
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   It adds like a pressure.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   Almost, you're hearing.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   The Bose are the best at noise canceling, but Sony is probably your best value.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   Oh, really?
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   They honestly, for any kind of repetitive noise, especially in offices with air conditioning, it's amazing.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   If you can tolerate that pressure, that synthetic pressure, you kind of feel more than here.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   They're great.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   I've used the Bose at work and they drowned out pretty much everything else.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   I kind of like them, they're decent.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   Well, we'll all be wearing them on an airplane so that some nitwick can talk for five hours on his cell phone.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   [Laughs]
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   God, there's nothing worse.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   I was- after we got back from France, I'm on the bus, you know, I took the air porter and I'm on the bus back,
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   and some guy just couldn't be an hour on a bus without being calling every one of his friends
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   who announced that he was back.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   He literally made 20 phone calls, and I'm just dying.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   Thank God for the edomotics.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   I don't mind the phone call so much, the mind of really loud phone calls.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   Well, everybody seems to feel like they have to talk loud on a cell phone.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.800]   Why is that?
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   Well, it's like, you know, it was like when my dad would wear a headset,
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   when he was supposed to do a CD player.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   Right.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.800]   So, can you get me a diet Coke?
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   What?
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.800]   [Laughs]
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   It's like, Dad, you're alone with headphones, okay?
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   Hi, you're just fine.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   [Laughs]
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   Hey, guys.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   I think personal- personal illicit cell phone jammers are going to be the new rage.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   It's like that TV be gone, isn't that awesome?
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   Oh, we just shut it.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   It just puts out every off-code for every display out there.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   You just walk around turn up.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   My son wants one of those.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   I said, "Henry, you don't go on enough bars yet.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   When you're 21, I'll get you a TV."
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   [Laughs]
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   It's not- you gotta- you gotta have a real need for it.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   What's your favorite gadget right now, Kevin Rose?
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   What are you doing?
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   Oh, man, I haven't got to see gadgets in a long time.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   Really?
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   Why not?
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   Well, I mean, we don't have as many on this show as we used to.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   I did see a really nice three CCD little miniature handheld camcorder the other day.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   You've got- because of the system, you're becoming an expert on camcorders.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   Yeah, we- well, we happen to get a- we purchased a really nice one.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   I was talking about- we were-
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   I was trying to- I was trying to- I was trying to- I think-
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   Is Patrick having a side conversation?
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.800]   I think so.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   I think he is.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   My wife just came down to share the side coke.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   Let's listen in.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   Let's listen in while Patrick and Sarah have a little marital discussion.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   [Laughs]
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.800]   Wait, where's the mute button?
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   Can- can- can- can- uh, should she hear what we're talking about?
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   Well, she could hear me when I was yelling about-
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   Oh.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   You know how I was talking about dad having the headphones?
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.800]   She's like, "Sawin, get me a coke!"
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   She can- and you're just really caught looking at her face.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   But she brought you a coke!
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   No!
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   She thought you were actually asking for one!
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   I love it!
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   Well, Sarah has been an important part of all of our podcasts today.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   All one of them.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   So, I'm glad she made an appearance- a little cameo on this one as well.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   How's marital life- have married life treating you, Patrick?
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   Good.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.800]   Amazing.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   You- you married a great woman.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   You really did.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   I like to thank you.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   You did- you did well for yourself.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   So, Kevin, you were saying there's a three-CCD camcorder
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   is it the Panasonic you like or what is it?
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   Which one are you-
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   The one that we use is the Panasonic.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   It's the 100A.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   The 24P one.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   Yeah, the 24P cam.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   And it's just a great camera all around.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   It's got the XLR inputs on the side so you can just go straight in from your wireless mics.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   It's really nice.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   But that is not really your typical consumer device.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   You know what I've been looking at lately that's really kind of got me excited is the fact that
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   I'm seeing more and more LCD monitors just fall in price.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   I just bought a really nice Dell 19-inch LCD.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   I got it for like three- a little over three-enter box.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   I saw that deal on dig.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   The widescreen Dell was so cheap.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   Was that the one you got?
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   No, I got the- this was- I have an Apple display.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   It's my main display.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   Really?
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   But this is just kind of a 19-inch Dell standard DVI for like $312 shipped to your door.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.800]   Which is just amazing considering you get DVI and it's a really nice and main image Dell.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.800]   That's cool.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   That's 1280 by 1024.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   That's nice.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   Is it secret that you do dig or is that known?
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   No, it's pretty much known.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   I didn't really go out shouting it right off the bat because I really didn't want to-
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   I love it.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   I'm a fan.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   Well, I appreciate it.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   Dig for those who don't know is kind of one better than Slash.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   Dot because instead of some random taco editing it, the humans who use it, who read it, choose
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   what stories float to the top.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   And as more and more people have joined Dig, it's become really better.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   I use it as part of my news beat check because I get the most interesting stuff that doesn't
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   show up anywhere else on there.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   Yeah, it's a lot of it's kind of offbeat stuff, but it's cool like that.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   And there's some articles I find that I haven't seen anywhere else.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   What's your plans with that?
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   Are you going to grow it?
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   Well, I've just been working on it just pretty much nonstop since November.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.800]   Oh.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   All my free nights and weekends, I've pretty much been working on it.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   Cool.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   Yeah, we're in the process of redesigning little portions of it to make it a little easier to use.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   I'm adding a bunch of new features, friends, so there'll be a friends list where you can
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   have a keep track of all your friends that are on Dig and it'll create dynamic RSS feeds
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   for your friends.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   So that you can have an RSS feed that you subscribe to that is just what your friends
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   are digging throughout the day that will automatically update.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   That's the future, isn't it?
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   That's the future.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   Oh.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   I've always thought we should have something where you could know where your friends are listening to,
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   reading at all times, and then you could just follow along.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   Exactly.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   And the nice thing about Dig is not really, it's not something that tracks you, obviously,
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   to all the sites that you go to, but you just let your friends know what you're into.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   So there's that, you know, there's that privacy there that is still intact.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   Speaking of websites, you know where I'm going with this, don't you?
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   Patrick Norton.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   Ah, yes, Patrick.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   St. Patrick's Day, you put up a site at like five minutes to midnight.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   Yes.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   And then what?
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.800]   It's a month later, have you posted another posting yet?
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   Oh, oh, oh, Skype conveniently has stopped working.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   Well, I'm not sure.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   But slam dance industry, is it slam dance industry dot?
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   It's actually, it's type pad dot Patrick Norton dot com right now.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   Or rather, vice versa, Patrick Norton dot type pad dot com, right?
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   So I actually need to basically start in this week and start updating a couple of times a week.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   You know what you are out the domain I just got, which I love, is Leo dot AM.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   Through the Armenian registry.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   Excellent.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   In fact, I was thinking we could make that be the official URL of this podcast, Leo dot
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   AM.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   That's not fair.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   Well, we'll have to come up maybe with the trots dot AM.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   Leo dot AM, maybe better than trot.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   You want to get trots is not maybe the best image.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   It's a 24 hour podcast about sitting down on the toilet and things have gone wrong.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   That's your right.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   Trotts dot AM.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   Tune in whenever you need to.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   One last question before we head for the hills.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   I presume is everybody up for doing this again next week?
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   Yeah definitely.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   Okay.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   And down the road, I'd like to do video.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   Figure out how we can kind of convert this to a television show.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   Well, you know, I've got the equipment.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   Huh?
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   Go ahead Patrick.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   So Kevin said he's got the equipment.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   I was saying we need to figure out how to up the audio quality on the Skype feed.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   Kevin's always said he's got the equipment.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   I'm still waiting to find out.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   Video.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   Oh, video.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   Okay.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   No, I'll definitely swap this mic out for you.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   Better mic for next week.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   It sounds better than you think Patrick.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   Why don't you hear the podcast?
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.800]   It actually isn't bad.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   It might just be the horrible equipment I'm using on my app.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   It could be.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   It could be.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   Another thing that we could do I guess is we could all just set up video cameras pointed
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   at ourselves while we do it.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   And then this would mean that the podcast would take a lot longer to get out.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   But we could all tape ourselves then mail me the tapes and we could edit it together
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   and make a TV show out of it.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   I've got the Mac mini so we can do the new Tiger.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.800]   That's what I'd like to try is when Tiger comes out on the 29th, it has video conference
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.440]   and what is it three or four way I can't remember.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.800]   I think three people at a time but four people can use it.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.280]   Do you want it now Leo?
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.520]   We can test it out.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.800]   I don't have it now.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   Oh, I got it.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.400]   Well, I'm allowed to say that.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.600]   Yeah, you're allowed to say that.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   Okay.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.800]   I don't know if you have a legitimate copy or not.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   Nobody else does.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   So.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   A developer student.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   To be able to, theoretically, I'm working on a Tiger book but I'm writing it the way I
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   write all my books which is completely hands off.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.160]   So the guy who actually is writing the book Todd Stauffer has the copy.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.880]   I didn't want to sign the NDA because if I found out anything, I didn't want to not
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.280]   be able to talk about it.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.920]   But when you know the easy, I'll tell you real quick, one of the easiest ways to get
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.680]   access to all this types of stuff is you can sign up for the developers network for
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   99 bucks.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.680]   Oh.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.280]   And they send you all the latest builds and you can log in and download what it's built.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.120]   Yeah, it's completely legitimately and legally.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.440]   Well, we're all going to, actually 99 bucks is cheaper than 129 bucks.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.520]   Do you get a final version as well?
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.680]   I'm not sure if you, well, yeah, they send you the final once it's out.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.400]   Well, that's a good deal.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.640]   Do you have to believe that's the student pricing though.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.200]   I think it's normally like one night.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.840]   Kevin's a student still.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.840]   Where are you studying, Kevin?
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.440]   Hey, I didn't say I paid 99 bucks.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.800]   It's a good deal.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.040]   It's just a good deal.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.200]   Well, April 29th, let's see if we can do that.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.080]   Patrick, do you have a Mac yet or are you still all Windows?
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.680]   I'm still in the all Windows sometime in the next couple months.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.480]   I'm probably going to buy Mac.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.960]   Unfortunately, the content management system we're doing, most of the professional work
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.520]   I'm doing right now is not particularly Mac friendly.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   How about you, Robert?
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.520]   Do you have access to a Mac or?
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.520]   I do not, actually.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.520]   All Windows.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.360]   I've just got a new ThinkPam though for work.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.440]   Well, it'll just have to be, you know, just me and Kevin.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.440]   See you guys.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.560]   No, we'll figure out some way to do it.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.320]   I mean, frankly, I don't think video adds anything at this point, but if down the road,
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.520]   you know, we wanted to kind of recreate this **** I guess we could do a really poor man's
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.840]   version of it.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.120]   Maybe it's not worth it.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.960]   I'll have to say one thing, Patrick, the audio quality of this is a lot better than the
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.760]   21st Amendment.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.760]   Ha.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.760]   Really?
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.760]   But we're not as happy.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:30.440]   That was a fun, that was a fun place to do this.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   It was.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.560]   If you want, we can get back together at the 21st Amendment.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.520]   The promise, you know, everybody's in a different city.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.640]   So it would be a little more tricky to do it.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.360]   But the next time everybody's in town, we should, we should all get together and do
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.360]   that.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   Guys, it's been a lot of fun.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.120]   Our first revenge of the, oh, I can't say the name, can I?
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.120]   That's right.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.720]   The revenge of Charles Hershorne, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   I hope you've enjoyed it.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   You're gonna get fired, Leo.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.320]   Kevin Rose has nothing to do with this.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.640]   He's just, you know, here.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   Thank you.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.640]   It was all my idea.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.640]   Can I call him Chuck?
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.640]   It was all my idea, Chuck.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.920]   Do you think, honestly, do you think he'll ever hear this?
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.960]   There's probably about a 75% chance.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.440]   Yeah, probably.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.040]   Well, this is the portion of the show where we give Kevin Rose a chance to disclaim everything
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.040]   you've just heard.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   That's right.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.560]   We've actually had nothing to do with this.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.240]   No, we have nothing to do.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   I'll be honest, I have nothing against G4 or Charles, and I'm happily and gainfully employed.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.120]   I know Robert's miserable with his life, but with the rest of his life, it was perfect.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.440]   I got a free ride to LA, and then I got a great five month vacation.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.440]   There you go.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.440]   And then I'm back up in the Bay Area.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   What's, what's, what's wrong with that?
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   I love Southern California.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.640]   No, I don't, I don't think, you know, I know we all get mail from viewers saying, God,
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.040]   I miss it and so forth.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.360]   But I don't think those of us who are involved in it have the same feelings that the viewers
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.360]   do.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.400]   I mean, we, we didn't watch the show.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.840]   We just made it.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.800]   So, you know, and we're all still doing our own thing and somewhere or the other.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.600]   I don't think Tech TV is ever going to come back.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.040]   I think that's long gone.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   But who knows?
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:15.320]   You know, I think with system and, and this and, and Patrick's slam dance industries,
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   who knows?
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.120]   You know, I think there's a possibility that,
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.600]   And don't forget call for help 2.0.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.160]   Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting that, don't I?
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.280]   Let's hope my Canadian masters don't hear this.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.920]   No, I love doing it.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.080]   And in fact, guess what?
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.400]   Kevin Rose is going to be on the show.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.400]   He's going to come up in May to be on the show.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.040]   Patrick and Robert, you have a standing invitation to come to Toronto anytime you, you feel like
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.800]   it's beautiful this time of year.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.560]   Oh, that's a good excuse.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.920]   The snow is almost completely melted.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.360]   Hey guys, thanks a lot.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.360]   Have a nice day.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.360]   Thanks for having us, Leo.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.880]   First edition of the Revenge of the Screen.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.880]   We'll be back next week.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.880]   Lawyers permitting.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.360]   Hope you'll tune in then.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:00.680]   Thanks to Wayne and Wax, and waneandwax.com for our theme.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.680]   Have a great week.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.680]   We'll see you later.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:09.680]   Bye.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:16.680]   Bye.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:23.680]   Bye.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:30.680]   Bye.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   Bye.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:43.680]   Bye.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.440]   (buzzer buzzing)
