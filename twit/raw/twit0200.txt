[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Salad Days.

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It's time for TWIT This Week in Tech, the show that covers all the computer news of the week in a very haphazard kind of lame fashion.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   So if you're looking for real news, maybe you should tune in to Buzz Out Loud.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Meanwhile, back here at the ranch, they just had their $1,000, you know.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Did they?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yes, they did.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   John C. Dvorak from Channel Dvorak.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Hello, John.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hello.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Of course, immediately as soon as you come on, David Prager moves his mic arm so that it's right in your shot.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Look at that.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Good, good.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Okay, David, could you just bend that somewhere else?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   There you go.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Oh, that's much nicer.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   So I better say hello to David Prager dodging the cameras right now from Revision 3.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Greetings.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I'm told you are actually the guy who runs Revision 3.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Kind of.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   He doesn't want to take responsibility for that.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   There's other people that do a lot of hard work.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   They work really hard, like Mauricio, who's back here with a camera stealing all my ideas.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Also in the big chair, the easy chair, the comfortable chair, it's Mr. Patrick Norton.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Hey, everybody.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And via Skype from the Space Shuttle Atlantis, it's Roger Chang.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Greetings.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Greetings all.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   This is the reason you have these old timers back on the show, besides the fact that we dearly love them, is that it is Twit 200.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Congratulations, Leo.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Thank you very much, John.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   That's like four years.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   How many weeks off has the show taken?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   A total of like three? Four?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Quite a few.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Really?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Oh, yeah. Oh, God.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   We took time off all the time.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And it's already the 200th show.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Well, it's the 200th show.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's not the 200th week.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Ah.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So I don't know what week it is.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I remember you would leave, and a couple of times Patrick just came up here and did the whole thing.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Patrick did the show.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And he stopped doing that after one edit session that went, I think, for a nonstop 48 hours.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It wasn't quite that bad.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I think it was 19.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It was a long edit session.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The rendering and the upload.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   He decided this wasn't for him.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   In fact, actually--
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   No, actually, I think it was more that wanting to preserve my marriage and my health at that point.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Yeah, I don't blame you.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   By the way, we are recording on Father's Day, and there are three fathers here.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Maybe four.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I don't know about you, David.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Nope.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'm still clean.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I'm still clean.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I'm still free.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Free and clean.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So we have the unclean and the clean in the room.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Those who have brand will be called unclean by David Prager.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Readers?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So happy Father's Day to you, Patrick, the newest father in the bunch.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Happy Father's Day to you, John, the longest term father in the bunch.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Notice I didn't say oldest.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Indeed.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And happy Father's Day to me, just the oldest.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And, Roger, no children yet?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   None that I know of.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   That he knows of.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   There's the old line.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   That's the old line.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I was waiting.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I was just hoping somebody would come up with that.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Have you guys been glued to Twitter and CNN watching the Iran stuff?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Not at all, huh?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I got it at first I did, but I got a little suspicious when I kept seeing all these signs in English.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   All the signs are coming in English.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   The whole world is watching.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Well, that's because they know who's watching.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Well, then the whole thing is just a set up.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It's just a scam.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Well, why do you say that?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I mean, it's not like people locally will be able to watch it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So there's not a revolution going on.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   There's a few hundred.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   To be able to access a lot of that media.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Well, I think there's so many people wanting to participate and a lot of people that are like, yeah, me too.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   So there's a lot of people that want to support something.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And so they're hashtagging half of their tweets to include support for a cause.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And so then it's hard to kind of vet and see, you know, what aside from the yeah, me too type of tweet.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Do you think it's bogus for me to have turned my avatar green?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I support the...
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   This is a meme that we don't need.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   What's wrong with this?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Every time somebody turns around, they got some avatar turned black.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Make your web pages black.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I did that one too.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   What's wrong with that?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I think it doesn't accomplish anything.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yes, it does.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Did you vote in the last election?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Should it be more cynical than that?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   In the U.S. or in Iran?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   In the U.S.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Of course I voted in the last U.S. election.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You can turn your avatar green.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Yeah, I agree. If you didn't vote...
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I don't think it's particularly useful.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I think it's useful. I think it's useful.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Have you written your congressperson?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Have you expressed concern?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I don't think that would be particularly useful.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I think Patrick just made a good point.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Have you written your congressman about this?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I don't know if that's useful.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Why is that not useful?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   That's got to be more useful than changing your avatar.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Let me get this straight.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Since you've opened this particular hideous can of worms,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   since we do not have communications coming from most of the United States Armed Services,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   since we have a rapidly destroyed country, two destroyed countries,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   with damaged infrastructure in Afghanistan and Iraq,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   and we have a genuine revolution of the people happening in an attempt to have a democratic change in leadership,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   representing the viewpoints and interests of the majority of the population,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I think we should, if we're going to say, if somebody's going to tweet me,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   they're like, "Dude, you really need to post the links to this, because it's important, it's like change."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It's like, one, I think you should contract your congress critter.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I think you should contract the state department.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I disagree. I don't think there's a role for the United States government to play.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   On the other hand, I think for the people of the world to show some solidarity with the Iranian people is great.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   But what is the U.S. government going to do?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It's nothing the U.S. government is huge interested in what's going on.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   But what are you going to do, march in and say whether your election was thrown?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   You can't. I think what the U.S. government is doing is actually completely appropriate, which is nothing.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I agree. I would add with Obama.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Obama's playing how he's supposed to.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I think you're missing the point.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   One at a time. Go ahead, Roger.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I think you're missing the point. The whole point of the Twitter thing was twofold.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   One is because Twitter was the main conduit for a lot of the communications.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And they encouraged people to help basically obfuscate who in Iran was actually Twittering so they could be safeguarded from the authorities.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Two was to show that there was enough support outside, directly from people, not from government agencies, not from governments.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   So I think it was a way for people to feel that there were people with them, but they didn't necessarily need to get governments involved,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   which would have complicated matters for them if the government of Iran will say, "Aha, look, the BBC, part of the United Kingdom, is obviously biased against us,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   and this is just a large plot against the government of Iran by foreign powers."
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Roger, I heard this meme already. It came from either Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It goes like the following.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   It's like, "We have to show our support here in the United States because it will give the Iranian people over there,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   once they find out that the American public is behind them, it will give them the impetus to go ahead and finish the job or whatever they have to do."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I don't know if I buy that either.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   No, no, I disagree with that assessment entirely.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   The whole point was to just give moral support. It wasn't there to kind of do it for them.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I mean, I think you're being extremely cynical about the whole thing.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   No. Sorry, I didn't really realize that was being cynical.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   The real tie-in here is just the real story, at least from a tech perspective, is the fact that more people are able to have a voice now
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   as would have ever been possible because of social networks.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   It's remarkable. The State Department contacted Twitter and said to say, "We know you're planning downtime. This was last weekend.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Can you not do it because people are using this in Iran?"
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Oh, wait. Didn't somebody mention talking to your congressperson in the State Department about why you think we should support a country that's trying to change its leadership through elections?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Well, I'm not saying it was the right thing for the State Department to do. I'm saying it's showing how --
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Why are you saying it's --
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I'm showing -- you're not listening. I'm saying it was important to -- it showed how important Twitter was.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I'm not saying it's the right thing for the State Department to do. I'm saying this is validation for the use of social networking in a revolution.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I saw a great piece by Andrew Sullivan in The Atlantic on last Sunday saying, "The revolution will be Twittered."
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Now, I'm not sure Twitter is the way. In fact, I have to cop to something because I used Twitter this morning.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I saw, "Mosavi's been arrested. Retweet this. It's been confirmed to the CNN." And I fell for it and I retweeted it.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Oh, you fell for that?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Well, I didn't -- I was running out the door and I thought, "Well, let's spread the word if it's true." But I should have -- what am I supposed to do, though?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   How am I supposed to research that? Yeah, I did fall for it.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   We don't jump to conclusions. I shouldn't have done that. I agree.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And you can go to -- you know, there's a million ways of finding out.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   The BBC, The Washington Post, The New York Times.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Well, on the way in -- because I was hopping in the car. I did listen on the way in. I scanned the dial trying to find confirmation. I did not find confirmation.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   The first thing I got the other day was -- so these phony pictures of the plane, the rear of the plane blowing off and it's being sent around the net.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Yeah. You know, it's taken from somebody inside. I usually don't fall for this.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I didn't fall for that at all.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   No, but I didn't fall for that one. But I fell for the Masavi one. And I admit -- and that was a mistake -- I usually don't fall for them. But that isn't what people are using Twitter for -- or shouldn't be using it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   My point is not for news gathering.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   No, I think the real point is the fact that you, a very experienced user who's very skeptical in terms of these hoaxes, would fall for something.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I know I fell for it. Yeah.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Means that you can just imagine what Grandma Ohio is doing.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Yeah. Well --
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   The same rules of journalism should still apply. At least the same code of ethics on someone whose job it is to disseminate news, to report on news, to investigate news. You have to uphold the same standards.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   We had this conversation last week. And the point is that it's not analysis. It's news. It's happening stuff as it happens. And it should be taken with a grain of salt. It's not --
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   All of this stuff is also being amplified by the fact that -- and mainstream media is even going off to make sure that everyone knows, "Hey, we're not allowed to be on the ground in there."
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Everyone -- they're jumping all over Twitter, all over Facebook, and all over YouTube to look for videos that people have posted from the ground in there because they say they're not allowed to do anything.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I don't know how much of it -- obviously there's people there that are trying to report from our journals. And then there's all the citizens out there.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I mean, if they were more of a first-world country there, I mean, everyone and their dog would have a freaking iPhone that shoots video.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I would recommend everyone read my current MarketWatch column at MarketWatch.com.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   They are?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I call it "The Seven Flaws of Twitter." And it discusses this problem.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   But by the way, Iran in the cities is a first-world nation in many ways. Highly educated. And that's why you're seeing this happen, where you might not see it in Somalia.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Yemen.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Or Yemen. Roger, you were going to say something?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   No, I'm just -- that is the danger of any kind of --
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Instant media.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Instant media, where you have FeatureDraw and you don't have time to digest or analyze and go through and basically either have the option to retweet it or just kind of sit on it.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's one of those things that comes with the technology.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Let me reiterate my initial question, though. Isn't it compelling?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And here's what's interesting. You know, on last weekend, CNN -- the meme on Twitter was "CNN failed because CNN didn't cover it." I guess they're covering it this weekend wall to wall.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Now, I don't know if that's because they're listening to Twitter, but I suspect it is. CNN seems to be very Twitter-fied.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   I wonder if Twitter didn't exist, if CNN would have been so high -- so on over the --
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Interesting, isn't it?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   -- is possible that --
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   -- that they got so humiliated because that's all people talk about --
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I think they did.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   -- that they trashed the CNN mail.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   -- pound CNN fail, exactly.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Well, it's also -- I mean, you think about CNN was there. They were covering the war in Kuwait.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   They really made their bones. And mostly it's been the 24-hour news cycle in the last five years.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   The 24-hour news cycle --
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Which they abandoned, unfortunately, on the weekends. All these stations abandoned it.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   They go home.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   They go home.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   They go to the Hamptons.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Hey, I work weekends.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   You only work weekends. You have five days off.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Well, it's funny since, you know, CNN has always been billed as kind of that 24-hour news --
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Yeah, they let us down. They let us down. Anyway, I think it's interesting that they're not doing it this weekend.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Do you feel let down by CNN?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   I did. On Saturday, I tuned in to CNN. I said, "I want to see what's going on."
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And they were showing American Chopper reruns with Larry King, and I was a little disappointed.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   I stopped watching CNN back in 2000.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Yeah, maybe I should. But where do you get your news then?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I believe it. I believe it or not.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Twitter.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Actually, I go -- these are my quote-unquote "sources." The BBC, the CBC, ABC, the Australian Broadcasting.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   So there's only things with "BC" in the title? Is that it?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   No, I also check the New York Times, Washington Post. I mean, I check a lot of -- I check at least, you know, six or seven online news sources.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   And then I'll go to English language versions of -- what?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Somebody said to see. He's got all these -- never mind. I'm just --
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   See, the interesting question is why the Iranian government doesn't completely shut -- I mean, look, this is obviously painful for them.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Why don't they shut this all off? Can a country just turn off the Internet, block these -- they're trying to block it.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   I mean, they can block satellite reception. I mean, they've tried, and they've blocked it successfully in certain areas.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   But I mean, unless you blanket the entire country with it and shut down all kinds of wireless communication, at some point you have to --
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I mean, the thing is Iran still has a functioning economy that depends on them trading with the outside world.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   They need to put in orders to take in money and stuff. I mean, they're not as isolated as people think.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I mean, they do multimillion-dollar contracts with petroleum companies. They do business with the Russians. They do business with the Chinese.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese. They do business with the Chinese.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   You know, you're blocked by many filtering programs. Block that website.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Probably the breast part.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   I think it's the breast part. Just thought I'd mention that.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   You don't have nudity on the site.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   You don't have nudity, but it sometimes is sexy.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   You know, what can I do? I can't control these guys.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   That's what I say. When anybody complains about Twitter, I say, "What can I do? I can't control these guys." It's not my fault.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Hey, speaking of not my fault, Jami Thomas, what about that, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   The Minnesota single mother of four who shared, using Kazot, 24 music files.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   She was tried last year. The recording industry sued her. Unlike most people, most people just cave and say, "Here's your $5,000. Go away."
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   She fought it. She fought the law, and the law won. $220,000 was the first judgment.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   But then a strange thing happened. The judge said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. I screwed up."
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   The judge got information from the recording industry to the effect that the law said it was sufficient to show the possibility of somebody downloading the songs, not the actual download.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   The judge gave that instruction to the jury and said, "No, I blew it. That's wrong, and you have to prove download. The recording industry doesn't like that."
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So the judge declared a mistrial. The second trial ended on Friday.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   It didn't work out quite as well as anybody thought. Instead of $220,000, Jami Thomas is now being fined.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   The jury found her guilty, fined her $80,000 a song, a total of $1.9 million for 24 songs.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   She's judgment-proof, but that's beside the point.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   What, she declared bankruptcy? What does she do?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Yeah, well, what are you going to do? I mean, it's not like she has the money.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   It's not like she has the money. She can't pay it. It's like the pirate bay. What are you going to do? Come and get it.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Hey, wait. What are you going to do? I got the money. I got the money.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Can they put a lien on that?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   You'd think that they could, like, garnish her wages for life.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   But if you declare bankruptcy, aren't you protected from --
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   There is an article, I saw an article that said that bankruptcy could be used to --
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Yeah, that's what you do. -- to get out of it.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Well, they have effectively put a severe cramp in her lifestyle.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   It's pretty bad. Yeah, she can't download anymore.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Well, but I mean also, I mean, it's, you know, it destroys her credit rating, you know, it's going to lose her house, I mean, unless she disclares bankruptcy.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   But it's amazing, like, it's interesting to think --
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Twenty -- 24 songs, 80,000 each.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Yeah, half those songs didn't pay out that much to begin with.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   What is the deal?
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   That's a way to make money in the music industry.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Was her defense, "I didn't do anything wrong," or was her defense, "I didn't do it"?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   I don't know if she admitted to doing it.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I think her defense was, "Come and get me."
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Because according to this copyright law that I'm reading in a Reuters article, I mean, they can fine up to $150,000 damages per song.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Sure, they can go for big-time damages.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   I don't know how they established the damages that high originally.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   They gave her a break.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Could have been worse.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Is it because they were originally --
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Theoretically, you can keep spreading it until they've lost that much money?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   These laws were originally designed to stop large-scale corporate pirates.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   So people who were bootlegging records or bootlegging --
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Counterfeiters.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Yeah, counterfeiters.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   So that's how these fines were scaled.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Is it more embarrassing -- who is it more embarrassing for, Jami Thomas or the RIAA?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   The RIAA doesn't care.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   They're guileless.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   They're not embarrassed by anything.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Apparently not at this point.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   They ought to be.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   How do you think American public feels when they see this single mother for -- whether she downloaded the songs or not --
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I think they probably get scared.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Well, that's the point, isn't it?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   You don't want to scare them.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's an example.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   She's an example.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   We've made an example of Jami Thomas.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   I think it's actually embarrassing for the recording industry to the point where the more they do this kind of thing, the more people steal.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I think it actually encourages theft.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Wasn't that the case already when they sued that, what, 12-year-old girl?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   You're right, John, they don't have any shame anymore, but don't you think at some point it goes the other way?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   It has the opposite effect.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Yeah, clearly the point of this is --
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I haven't seen any evidence of it.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   That's the problem.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I like this theory.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   You think fewer people are stealing?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   No, I think they're just doing it more carefully.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That's all.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   They got better at it.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   But I don't think it's creating a backlash that you're implying.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   I think there is a backlash.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   I think people have come to hate the recording industry.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   They've come to hate the record labels.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   And as a result, they feel no compunction stealing from them.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   If you want to discourage people from stealing from you, you don't make yourself a villain.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   You make yourself the wrong party.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   No, I'm not going to argue with you on this point.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   I'm just telling you, I don't see any evidence --
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Yeah, you might be right.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   -- that the public is buying into that.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   According to a new survey, 8% of all consumers in Britain, France, Germany, and the U.S. admit to downloading video illegally.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Two-thirds of those surveyed in Britain often or sometimes watch TV, movies, and video on their PC or laptop.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   U.S. consumers not far behind of those.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Fifteen percent did it illegally, according to this Future Source Consulting survey.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   You know, the problem with these surveys is you don't know if it's -- it's usually the recording industry, the TV industry that --
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   It's paying for it.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   It's paying for these.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   France's House of Parliament approved a bill last month --
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   What are you looking at?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   I can't find the stories.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Oh, I didn't put them on there.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I'm surprised you --
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Hey, I got it.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Actually, I found it on delicious.com/twit.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Yeah, I put it up there.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I put it up there.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Now I didn't see that.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I put it up later.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   No.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It says 8% admit to downloading video illegally or illegally.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   France's Lower House of Parliament approved a bill last month that will let authorities track illegal downloading over the Internet and disconnect repeat offenders.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Well, I'm glad the French are working for our Hollywood people.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   It's good.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Thank you, France.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   The United States government was working for Hollywood in the RIAA.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   The French actually have its own music industry and music industry as well.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   They were --
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Hold on.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Go ahead, Roger.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   What?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Oh, no.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I'm just saying that the French have their own movie and television and music industry as well that have their -- that have RIAA-like supporters in pushing that particular bill or whatever they call it in the French government through.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I missed the subtitle to this headline.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   8% admit to downloading video illegally.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   92% are liars.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Have you downloaded a video?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Have you downloaded a video?

[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   So, if Microsoft actually built an operating system without any of the inherent security flaws
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   and it was generally a pretty solid, safe, secure operating system,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   would they be sued for crowding out the market for any of that?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   You killed the market for security!
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   That's an awesome concept.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Microsoft, they made it secure, and now we're suing.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Windows 7 release was blocked today by a court...
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   ...junction.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Well, by the way, we never have to worry about that anyway.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Why not?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   It's academic.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   It's never going to happen.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   I love it. Activision is saying to Sony, "You're charging too much for the PS3."
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   How can they go to Sony and say, "You're charging too much for a product?"
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   They just do it.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Never mind.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   They're Activision.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   I think they did it in an interview.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   I think a lot of companies are very bitter about the PS3 and had hoped for more from that platform.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   But I don't think how much they're charging is the problem with the PS3.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Well, the problem is the user base isn't as high as I think they were expecting.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   I think people were expecting PS2-level installed bases for the console.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   For the amount of money that they invest in trying to generate a PS3 version of a popular game,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   they were hoping to make more money than they have been, I guess, is the complaint.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Activision is saying, "Well, we won't."
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   We deserve to make more money. What's wrong with you, Sony?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I think it's part of just a general push by a lot of people other than Sony to decrease the price
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   and get that particular video game console into more households so they can sell more games.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   I just got a confusing message in IRC, a PM, private message, saying,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   "Hey, can you tell Nick I need him to make the deposit via the washing machine ASAP?"
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Thank you. So, Nick, I don't know what that means.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   What?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   It sounds illegal, actually.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Just drop it in the washing machine.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Why is that in my IRC channel? What is going on here?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Leo Laporte arrested today for money laundering. Literally.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Bada bing.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Bada bing, bada boom.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   So how do I get back into the chat room after being kicked off?
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   I don't know why you were kicked off.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   I think it has to do with the fact that only a certain number of people from one IP address can be in the chat room.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   But you were in before others. I don't know why you should do that.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Why would I get kicked off? So now I can't answer these fascinating questions.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Maybe I'll read over here and see what's next.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   What fascinating questions are you getting?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Well, I'm getting none now.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Activision is bluffing. Nigerian money royalty.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   I don't know what that means at all.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   All right, moving along. Moving along. There's nothing to see here.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   She's going to fix the problem.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   She's going to fix the problem.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   China has disabled some Google functions.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   China says that Google too often links to pornographic and vulgar content.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   You know, I don't get very much vulgar or pornographic content from Google.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   There's a safe search feature that blocks it.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Bing.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Bing's been good for that?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   How do you like the thumbnails?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   That's why they call it Bing, by the way.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Ooh. Bada.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Sorry.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   They have the -- if you do a porn search, you get the thumbnails of the video and they play.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Back online.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   They play automatically.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   It's very cool.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   That's a little help subject, a little help tip there.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Ah, boy.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   So, Patrick, you tell me, did this show used to be better than this?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   The heat.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Well, okay, let's open up another can of worms.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   What does everybody think about the --
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   A can of worms just being opened.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   I know where you're going to go here.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Already?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   I know exactly which can of worms.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   The reporting on -- the Wall Street Journal reporting on Steve Jobs' liver transplant.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   That's where you were going.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   All right.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Can I make a first comment?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Absolutely.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Okay.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   If you say first, you're in trouble.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   That's a good -- I never thought of that joke.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   First post of Orack.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Okay, so here we go.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   So in January, there was a rumor floating around that Steve Jobs is buying a house in
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Memphis, which is where there's this hospital where he had the operation, by the way, that
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   is known for having the best endocrinology department in the country.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Is that why?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Because I was trying to figure out why Memphis.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   I mean, you're near Stanford.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   No, no, Memphis has got the endocrinology guys.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   All right.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   And everybody, all the fanboys shouted down this rumor, "Oh, it's horrible, terrible,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   horrible."
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Then in the same month, in January again, there was a slew of rumors about Steve Jobs
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   needing a liver transplant.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   And this, of course, because apparently --
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   He has pancreatic cancer, though.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Sometimes it jumps to the liver and you get a little problem there, even though some -- I
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   was reading all the commenters and they're going, "Oh, he's an alcoholic."
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And back in the day, Apple said that he had a hormone imbalance.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Imbalanced.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   And meanwhile, he got shouted down again.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   All these guys, they had good information about the house, they had good information about
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   the liver transplant, or that he's going to get one, and they were shouted down.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   This is your Twitter, your online, your social networking.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   You guys are all so high on.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And they shouted down these guys with really good reports.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   And now it turns out that this all was true.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   On May 30th, I got an email.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   I won't say from whom.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   It says, "Leo, Steve Jobs was -- this is May 30th.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   This is two months ago -- was just recently released from Methodist University Hospital
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   in Memphis after being a patient there for approximately a month.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   His stay was kept very hush-hush.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   I didn't hear that he was there until he left.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   My source is an employee who would not divulge other details."
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   And I looked at that email and I said, "I'm not going to report that.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   I mean, I have no corroboration."
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I guess it was true.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   And I would believe that story because based on the other stuff that was coming out -- in
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   fact, if you started reading the local papers, which you might want to have done, you would
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   have found that there was a lot of buzz in Memphis about Steve Jobs being in town.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   But the Wall Street Journal quotes an anonymous source.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Well, this is what's interesting.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   The Journal does not usually do this completely unsourced.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Well, it's kind of a big scoop in a way.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I'm kind of surprised that -- knowing that the way that rumors around anything surrounding
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Steve Jobs and Apple normally are, I'm pretty surprised that -- I mean, at least five or
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   six or probably more than that, people had to know that Steve Jobs was in this hospital.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And it's not exactly easy to find a major organ to transplant into a human.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   And the fact that it took two months for --
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Somebody also said that one of the reasons for Memphis is that the waiting list is half
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   as long in Memphis.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   I think that's bogus.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   You don't think that's --
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   I read the same thing, but I don't know if it --
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   I don't believe that part of it.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   I mean, I think that's just a speculation.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   You know, I don't think --
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   We don't know why Memphis.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   But you say they have a great endocrinologist in Memphis.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Yes, there's an endocrinology department at this hospital in Memphis that's supposed to
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   be the best in the world, period, and it's an endocrinology problem.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Well, you know he's going to go wherever the best is, right?
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Right, and he can afford it.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   So, Patrick, they want you to speak your mind.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Yeah, you started it.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   You started it.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   What do you think of the reporting and the story, and is it appropriate?
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   Is it off limits or --
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Well, partially it's kind of fascinating to look at the fact that the Wall Street Journal
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   published this without attributing a source, which is forbidden in their rules.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   It's a sign that --
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   It's a shock.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   That's the old rules.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Well, but they're still following those rules.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   When you say the new journal, what do you mean, John?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Is this the Rupert Murdoch journal you mean?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Yeah, they're a little more proactive.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   But for the most part, the journal at least attributes someone close to it.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   It's just they're completely blank on where it's at.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   If I had read this in the mirror, I wouldn't have credited it.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   The way I would have to assume it would happen, they had a really good source.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   They knew who it was.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   The editors confirmed it, but the guy could not, because Steve Jobs is a secret freak,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   they could not reveal who it was, and they had to present it this way.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   But I'm absolutely sure that the journal writers and the editors all knew who the source was,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   then they all were -- there was no problem.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   They were obviously willing to trust the source.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   I'm not doubting that.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   I'm sure the source is a very trustworthy source.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   The starting gets spiked, so obviously the journal trusted the source.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   But it's also interesting when people -- because some people,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   I've heard people who have been horrified by it.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   And I think the cold hard fact is Apple is a publicly traded company,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   and Steve Jobs has been intimate in the resurrection of that company from a failing second-tier operating --
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   I should say a failing second-tier computer company
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   that at the time probably had the best operating system out there.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   At the time, really?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   At the time.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   I never touched it until the last time.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Actually, OS 9 was not very good.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   They needed to make the OS 10 jump.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   He saved them because he was able to make that jump, bring Next software in and make that jump.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   And actually, it was not just that, it was the hardware basically --
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   The vision, the iMac, you bet.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   The iMac alone, the iMac basically created the entire USB --
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   basically pretty much created the entire USB accessories.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   They were already on tens of millions of PCs at that point.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   There were probably like two keyboards available for USB.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   The iPod, the iTunes, the negotiations with the music.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   He's been presented, and he's always presented himself as so core to the vision of this new, successful, vibrant Apple.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   What I think it comes down to is as a public company, everything seems to be fair game.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Now, what I really wish is that the Wall Street Journal and other entities were looking as closely
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   at the entire banking industry and mortgage industry in the last half a decade
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   as they are with Steve Jobs and his little --
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   It's a little late to care so much.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Well, talking about this market, I mean, Monday, tomorrow,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   is going to be the first day that the market opens since people officially knew about this.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Well, don't you think it's interesting that the Journal waited --
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   You wouldn't want to see it fall out immediately.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   The Journal waited until the iPhone came out.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   They waited until the market was closed.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   They waited -- it was a triple-witching day.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   A weekend. Quadruple, actually.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Quadruple-witching day. They waited until all of that was done.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Released it at the least, in fact, the least damaging point.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   They could have released it.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Probably to make sure that they -- to minimize the likelihood that they would be sued for impacting the stock price.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Or, here's a conspiracy theory.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Their source, their unimpeachable, absolutely reliable source, was Apple itself.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   Hmm.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   If you're Apple and you want to control this story --
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I'll tell you, I'll tell you one good reason I can buy into that,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   because a lot of the rumors were about that he had pancreatic --
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   it was going to be pancreas cancer, which is pretty much like --
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   if you have -- if you have, you know, if you have pancreatic cancer,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   you pretty much cash everything out and go have a party, because, you know, at that point --
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   If it's liver cancer, a transplant's a cure unless it's metastasized.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Absolutely. But for pancreatic cancer, you're pretty much done.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   You're dead.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   So maybe Apple did this --
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   So in that case, telling the entire world that it wasn't pancreatic cancer would be a primary goal.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   It seems like such a convenient time.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   It seems like the only possible time you could release this information.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   In the -- it was certainly timed in the best possible way for Apple.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Well, they're up 60 percent this year.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Yeah, they've had a good year.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   And they've done it without Steve Jobs at the helm.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   So we won't -- if people want to know if Apple's a solid business --
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   They've done it without Steve Jobs at the helm, or they've --
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Steve Jobs is still at -- I would be shocked if Steve Jobs isn't having huge amounts of input.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Steve Jobs -- nobody hired Steve Jobs because of his hands-on skills in managing the day-to-day operations of a company.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Yeah, and to his credit, everything he listed before is absolutely true with what he did,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   with, well, you know, the iPod, the iTunes dealings, and --
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   If it was somebody in the hospital who knew -- Swift 2001 points out in our Stick Amp chat --
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   that person's a felon because, of course, it's -- that's a felony to violate the privacy, according to HIPAA.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   I don't think it was. I think it was Apple.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I think it was Steve's own people who said, you know, we need to control this story.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   We need to spin it properly.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   What better place to do it than the Wall Street Journal?
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   What better time to do it than after the market's closed, after the phone is shipped?
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   There is -- there were rumors that that's why the phone shipping date was jumped.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Hmm.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   But the question now -- there's another big question.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   If it was liver cancer alone, the transplant could cure it.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   If it had metastasized, it's a very risky procedure, which some hospitals won't do
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   because the immunosuppression drugs that they give you after a transplant, in fact, encourage the cancer.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   They fight your ability to fight the cancer.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   We don't know any details.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   So we don't know. It's speculation.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   We'll find out because I think they're going to have to report this to the board or the shareholders or something.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Best possible scenario, this is -- it was cancer in the liver only.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   The transplant was a success.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Apple decided to spin the story to control it.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   So they released this to the Wall Street Journal at the most opportune time for them.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   Now, I would expect to see more from them, though, before the weekend is out, wouldn't you?
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Yeah, probably.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   They're not denying it.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   Well, that's right.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   I mean, if it was absolutely untrue, I think they would have said it was untrue.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   They're neither confirming nor denying.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   They said, "Steve continues to look forward to returning to Apple at the end of June, and there is nothing further to say."
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   I would think it's going to be interesting to see what he looks like when he returns.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   It ain't going to be good if he had a liver transplant.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Well, it's two months after the transplant.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   That's true.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Maybe he's at the gym, for all we know, pumping up.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   I don't know. I hope he's healthy.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Yeah, I wish him the best.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   We all wish him the best.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   To me, that's the bottom line.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Let's get him better. He really doesn't want this attention. I think he understands that.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Yeah, West.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   If you're CEO of Apple, you're going to get attention.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   There's going to be attention. There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   Maybe let's just hope this is the end of it, and everything's fine.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Anybody buy a new iPhone?
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   I did.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   You did?
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Did you get it early before it came out?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   No.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And it's not free.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   Screw you, Dvorak.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Did you get it cheaper than an average person would have? Did you save a nickel?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   No. I bought it at full list.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Did you buy it at full list just to show off because you got a lot of money?
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Hey, if you get it at full list, does that mean you don't have a two-year contract?
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   I do.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Why?
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   No, I didn't get it at full list because remember, I bought one, of course, a year ago, like any foolish Apple fanboy.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And so I've had this one for a year, the old 3G for a year, another 0.3.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   So you didn't get AT&T to --
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Well, apparently AT&T caped. You heard that, right?
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   No, I mean, you didn't get AT&T to subsidize the phone.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   No, they did subsidize it a little bit.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Because they subsidized it whatever the rate is, and I signed a new two-year contract.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   I did that, but I only had mine for a year. You don't get the $1.99 deal. You might get it at full list.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   $4.99?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   This phone is really a lot like the other one.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   It's exactly like the other one.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   You know what? It's very disappointing.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   So the question is, was it worth buying?
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   No.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   No.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   Okay, I'll tell you, there's one reason that it's worth buying.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   And you're going to read a lot of FUD about this. It is faster.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   This is the new ARM chip, the 8, and it's got L2 cache.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   The other one didn't. It's 600 MHz compared to 412, blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   And it's snappier. It doesn't feel like it's twice as fast, but it's snappier.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Browsing is much better. But that's not why you buy it.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   Because the other one wasn't that slow.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   It has a compass. That's not why you buy it.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   I like the compass idea.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   I like the camera. That's one of the main reasons to buy it.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   That's why you buy it. You buy it because it's got a 3 megapixel camera,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   which has autofocus, which is pretty good.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   3.2.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And video.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   No, I mean, it's like your E71 has better quality video, but it's not an iPhone.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   So it's the iPhone Plus video.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   And actually, I think that's what's interesting.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   You were saying, Patrick, that they broke it down and it's got a better chip in it than the...
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Somebody pulled it apart, and I'm sorry. I should dig this through.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   It was iFixit probably.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   They said it was capable of doing 720p video,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   but that the battery life would be so abysmal at that point.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Right. My advice to anybody would be not to buy this.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   If you've got the old 3G, upgrade to System 3, the new firmware,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   which does add cut and paste and MMS once AT&T gets off their duff and so forth.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   But, you know, it's not... Did you buy it?
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Good video quality.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   The video quality is really good. I like the video quality.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   So you bought it, David?
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Yeah, I bought it. I mean, I paid. I got...
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   I was not under contract, so they gave it... So I could get the discount.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   So you had bought the original one or you just didn't have an iPhone?
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   I had an iPhone 3G. I don't understand why I wasn't under contract. I know I wasn't.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   So they were able to give me... I guess you save about $200?
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   So all things said and done, though, I still had to pay for the 32 gig one.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   I think 300 and some odd, just over 300 after taxes.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   An $18 upgrade fee, which I still don't understand, because I thought the upgrade was the hardware.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   They charge you an upgrade fee. Can you believe that?
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   So I said, "Well, I wasn't going to argue with them because it's already in there,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   but I was kind of confused to myself. What's the $18 for?"
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   Cell phone companies are scams.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   They're ripping you off.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   You might as well ask them why they charge you $1,500 a megabyte for SMS messages.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Well, they do.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   They thought it was unlimited data.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   SMS is not considered data in the AT&T's world.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   No. If any phone company charges you 20 cents a message...
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   If it's not data, what is it?
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   It's SMS.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   It's an extra charge is what it is.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   It's because they can make money doing it.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   The same reason people charge for ringtones.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   People will steal music ad nauseum, but they'll pay for MIDI music for ringtones.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   A dollar for like a 10-second ditty.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   That's why I use Twitterberry on my Blackberry.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   What's the other one? Tiny Twitter.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   It's because if I actually SMS'd, I only get so many.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   I think I get like 100 or so.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   I usually go through those pretty quickly.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   It's kind of a way to communicate with people without necessarily getting charged a nickel.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Here's some good news.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   The acting chairman of the FCC, Michael Kops, has instructed staff to review cell phone exclusivity arrangements.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Now, you know, one of the problems with the iPhone is it's AT&T or nothing.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   That's a deal breaker for a lot of people.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   AT&T is horrible in San Francisco.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   Maybe that's one little area, but I can't go across town.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   Oh, I drop calls right and left.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   And it's not the fastest 3G sprint in Verizon or much better.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Most people would say, "Get it on Verizon. I'll buy the darn thing."
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Yeah, because you get all those guys following you around.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   I love those guys. The guy with the glasses, he's so cute. He's hot.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   In the fast-changing wireless handset market, we must ensure that consumers are able to reap the benefits
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   that a robust and innovative competitive marketplace can bestow.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   I don't know what that means.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   I have no idea. I don't have to parse that sentence.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   But I'm glad that the FCC is looking into it.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   Do you think they have a chance in hell of eliminating handset exclusivity?
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   No. How can you tell Apple you can't make a deal with a carrier for exclusivity?
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   How can you tell them that?
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   I mean, it's the FCC. I guess they could do anything.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   They could do anything.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   But still, that's kind of – talk about anti-business.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   That would change the entire cell phone industry.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Yeah. I mean, it's just anti-business.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   If I want to make an exclusive deal with a company to carry my product, why can't I do that?
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   I have a – well, maybe there's some other arguments about rural carriers being left out and something like that.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Anyway, my recommendation on the 3G – what do you think?
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   I mean, I think it's nice to have the video, but unless you need the video or a compass –
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   I'm excited to have it. Do I need it? No way.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   The 3G would have been fine.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   And so I'm now wondering what to do with my 3G. If I should give it to somebody or maybe sell it.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   Give it to me.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   I don't know. I might give it away.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Gaming will be good. I'll buy it so Sarah can have a –
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   The thing I say – I've always said this about the iPhone is not a – I don't think it's a very good phone.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   I think it's an awesome little computer.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   It's a computer.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Yeah. It's a nice little computer.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   And it's a breakthrough. I mean, that's what's very interesting about the iPhone.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   It's really put a personal computer in pockets of millions.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   So it's kind of what Newton was supposed to be and wasn't.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Yes. Bucky Bitt has to write something intelligent.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   Bucky Bitt?
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   Never mind. I'm just looking at this.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   You're talking to the chat room again.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   I'm talking to the chat room.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   It's real feedback.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   It is real feedback.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   So is this.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   So I went to the rollout of the Olympus pen.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Ooh. I want to get one.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Wait a minute. A pen rollout?
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   No, no. It's a takeoff of the 50-year-old camera that they had called the pen.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Oh. It's gorgeous.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   It's a retro camera.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   It's really actually pretty nice.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   And here's what it is.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   For one thing, the pictures it takes are – I mean, it's still got the big giant sensor,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   but the little bitty mini lenses are quite sharp.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   But I took and dropped this thing on a cement floor from this high,
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   went flying, hit the cement floor. It's a stainless steel camera.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   Wait a minute. Did the PR rep leap and try to catch it like it stretched out?
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   I did this after the PR people were seen.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Did you get that for free?
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   I am borrowing it.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   And screw you, Leo.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   Screw you.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Is this a free pen?
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   I want to – so tell me, did it break when you dropped it?
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   Did it – does it still work?
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   It was an even – it's made out of solid pieces of stainless steel.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   There wasn't even a nick.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   Ooh.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   I was stunned.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   So what makes – is this a good camera or just like the retro?
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   It's a micro four-thirds.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   In other words, what they've done is they've taken an SLR camera
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   and they took the mirrors and all the stuff out of it
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   so they can make it as small as possible.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   But it still has interchangeable lenses that are even smaller than normal.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   Oh, so it's an SLR?
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   Yeah, without the mirror.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   No, no, it's not an SLR. There is no reflex action.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   It's great if you take the shutter off.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   It's a rangefinder.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   No, it's not a rangefinder. I don't see any rangefinding.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   No, no, no. So there's no viewfinder on it. It's a live view only.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   It's three-inch.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   Does it use a camera, Roger, or not a mirror? Is that how it works?
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   No, there's a straight –
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   No, there's a straight sensor behind the lens.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   If you take it off, you'll see the sensor exposed.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   But what are you looking at?
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   You look at the three-inch LCD like everybody does now.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   Oh, I see it's LCD.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   Like a point and shoot.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   You do have the option to buy an optical viewfinder,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   but that slides into the hot shoe, but it's not –
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   That's only for the 17-millimeter lens.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   Yes. It has no built-in flash.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   No, but the flash that you get with it is a flamethrower.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   Did you bring this thing? Why didn't you bring it?
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   It's in the car.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   All right, we're going to do a commercial. Why don't you go get it?
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   I should have went up there. I want to hold it.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Yeah, you should have always went up here.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Anyway, the Olympus, one thing I have to give them credit for,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   always has the best flashes.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   So I'm in this huge church. I think it's pitch black.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   I like the whole place up.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Oh, I bet they love that. They're a bunch of blind nuns.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   All right, you go out. You get the camera.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   I'm going to talk about Audible. How about that?
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   And you can give us a little demo afterwards.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   You like this chance to stretch your legs.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   John's of a certain age.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   There he goes.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   I'm going to move my -- hey, by the way, Patrick Norton,
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   thank you so much for the cupcake.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Should have had 200 candles, but that's okay for a 200.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   You're trying to put 200 candles on a cupcake?
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   That's really sweet.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   You want 200 candles?
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   Give me the Delafatoria cupcake back.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Oh, it's from Delafatoria. Oh, that's different.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   That's a serious cupcake.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   That's the best cupcakes money can buy.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   Mmm.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   Oh, that's good.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   It's the best reason to come to Petaluma is Delafatoria.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   Or to go to the San Francisco Farmer's Market.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   Another -- yeah, well, they're at the Farmer's Market.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   That's where I buy my bread.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   At the Ferry Building there.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   Yes.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   Every Saturday.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   Every Saturday.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   Hi, Edmund.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   Yeah, you would like them. They're nice guys.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   I really like them.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Do you know Elise?
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   I don't know Elise, but I've met some of the guys.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   We were trying to find bread right before Christmas,
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   on literally Christmas Eve, and I drove to what turned out to be
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   their bakery instead of the downtown store,
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   because I thought they had --
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   They're in Turok. They're way out in the country.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   They have a wood-fired --
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   I'm always wandering around the countryside of Sonoma County.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   You'd like to drive.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   It's beautiful, isn't it?
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   Oh, it's absolutely gorgeous.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   It's hell on sale, we're saying.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   We're going in August.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   You and Sarah should come with us.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   Bring your son, too.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   They have dinners out at the ranch there.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Oh, really?
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   Love to have you come.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   I'll get tickets for you.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   Yeah, it'll be really fun.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   Yeah, and you can bring the baby.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   And they serve an amazing meal.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   This, by the way, was not a commercial for Delafatoria.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   But they do make wonderful bread and pastry.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   I might have to charge them for this one.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   We're going to talk about Audible today.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   Audible.com.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   I am a big Audible fan.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   Whenever I do all that driving that Patrick does,
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   I don't do it.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   In fact, you know, I've been commuting to the show this week
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   because the family's all out at the beach an hour away.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   And it's great.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   I miss my driving time because I love Audible.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Audible, of course, is the place you go to get audio books.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   60,000 now.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   They're up to 60,000 books.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   The best readers in the world.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Audible.com.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   I got an email the other day from somebody who says,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   "I can't find audio.com," where it's Audible.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   And as long as you're going there, let me give you a URL.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   Audible.com/twittoo.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   Now, when you go to that page,
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   you're going to get a chance to sign up for the Platinum account.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Now, that's what I use.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   It's a two-book-a-month account.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   And I go through two books pretty easily.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   There's a gold account, which gives you one book.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   The only reason I mention the Platinum account
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   is because you get two free books.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   You start off with two books absolutely free.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   And I guess, you know, you could go to the front page.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   You'll see they have lots of recommendations on the front page.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities."
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   That would be a great free first book.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   How long is that?
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   That's got to be 30 or 40 hours.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   That's a fun book about the last Wall Street boom and bust.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Yeah, 27 hours long.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   There's also a number of books about Steve Jobs.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   I'm going to recommend those if you want to find out
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   about the man who transformed Apple, created --
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   or the success of Pixar.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   "Icon" is probably the one by Jeffrey S. Young.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   That's the one that Steve got so mad about
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   that they pulled the publisher --
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   every one of the publisher's books from Apple stores worldwide.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   Ironically, there's nothing bad about Steve in the whole book.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   I don't know exactly.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   Maybe he didn't read it.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   "Icon" -- Steve Jobs,
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   "The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business"
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   by Jeffrey S. Young.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   That's a great choice.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   Lots of business books.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   There's fiction, nonfiction, sci-fi.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   You're going to love it.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Get your first two --
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   "The Second Coming of Steve Jobs" by Alan Deutschman,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   also very good.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   You're going to get your first two books free.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   Get both of them when you go to audible.com/twit.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   It'll be a Steve Jobs marathon.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   Audible.com/twit2, I'm sorry.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   They've been a great sponsor of the show
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   for over 100 episodes.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Do you speed it up?
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Some people --
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   You know, you can't.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   Did you see on the new phone --
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   You can't do it?
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   They can't.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   I love what they --
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   Who changed my desktop picture?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   You changed my picture on the --
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   You did, Dvorak.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   You changed it from my kids to a dog.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   It's Father's Day and you changed my picture to a dog.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   It's a cute dog.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Whose dog is that?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   It's a dog at the beach.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   It's not my dog.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   It's some dog.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   You just take pictures of dogs?
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   Don't you?
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   What do you do with that pen?
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   Anyway, before you get to the pen,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   I just want to show folks or talk about it.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   When you're listening to books now on the new iPhone,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   they've added some really nice features.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   You can -- right on the front there.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   Did you notice this?
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   It says 1X or you could press it and it goes to 2X
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   or you could press it again and it goes to half X.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Half X?
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Right on the front of the iPod now.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   There's --
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   Hear, hear --
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   Let's see.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   You know, it doesn't because I think it pitch shifts it.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Let's hear it.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Let's hear what it's doing.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   [Music]
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   Oh, that's music.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   You want to hear what I'm listening to right now?
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   Brilliant's audio presents the unabridged recording of Bond.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   It sounds like it is pitch shifting it.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   It is.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   It's her same voice, but it's very slow.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   Well, I love being able to speed up audio books if you're going to --
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   Here, here's the 2X.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   [Music]
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   The music's --
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   [Music]
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   I can't -- you can barely hear it.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Yeah, you can't hear it, but everybody at home can.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   There's a 30-second rewind feature that gets you back 30 seconds at a time,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   which is great for audio books because, you know,
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   the cop pulled you over or whatever and you have to rewind back to the original.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   And it's got a much better scrubbing feature as you move your finger down.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   I have to say, this is almost a reason to buy the new phone if you listen to a lot
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   of books or spoken word or podcasts.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   As you move your finger down, the scrubbing is slower or faster,
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   depending on where your finger is on the screen.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   There's some nice features about that.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   Anyway, Audible is great on the new iPhone,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   but it plays on all sorts of stuff, on Zunes, on Kindles.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   Let's take a look at the pen, audible.com/twit2.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   It's got a little thing you can have.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   Ooh.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   You can have it so it's like it has a level.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   Ooh, that's pretty.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   It's got a level in it?
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   You have to flip it.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   Oh, that's really cool.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Well, it's for people who take crooked pictures.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   No, I always have problems with the horizon.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   Oh, it feels like an old style camera.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   Yeah, it's very retro.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   It feels good.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   Now, how much are they charged?
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   It's a thousand bucks, isn't it?
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   I think it's seven.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   Eight hundred.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   Eight hundred.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   And you want one of these, Roger?
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   Yeah, I already put in my Amazon pre-order.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   Oh, I kind of like it.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   But now you have to get all new lenses, right?
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   No.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Well, this is the great thing.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   That's the joke about it.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   You can get an adapter for all the regular four-third lenses,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   and you can get an adapter for old OM1 lenses.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   Oh, I love the OM1.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   And you can get adapters for the old Nikon, the old Leica M mount,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   and the old Canon FD mount.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   What happens with adapters mostly is that the distance from the camera
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   to the sensor is such that you can't get the lens close enough
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   or the adapters won't make it.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   But this thing is because it's been redesigned,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   the lenses on old cameras have to be pushed way out,
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   so there's all kinds of room for an adapter.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   Right.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   This is nice.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   Yeah, it's got a nice feel.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   Nice, really heavy, with solid feel to it.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   It takes a really outstanding photo.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   And the photos are good.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   How many megapixels is it?
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   Twelve, two.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   And it's a big sensor.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Yes, the big four-third sensor.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   And why did you order it, Roger?
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   Because first you get the interchangeable lens.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   It's a larger format sensor.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   It's not as big as an APC.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   It's not full format.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   APS-C.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   It's not a full format.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   It shrinks the lens down to a...
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   Bunk.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   Oh, it sucks it in.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   Sucks it in.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   But it's super versatile, and it's a lot smaller
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   than my Canon Rebel that I haul around right now.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   I think it's a good travel camera for people
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   who don't want to lug around.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   When's it going to be out?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   In about two weeks.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   It's not going to be in time for me to take it to China,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   unfortunately.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   Maybe you can stop by the factory.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   I wouldn't take a brand new camera to China.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   I'd take a camera I was used to.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   No, I'm taking my Canon 5D Mark II.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   That's what I'm taking.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   I have all the lenses.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   What are you going to China for?
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   I hear there's Chinese people there.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   When are you going?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   Good Chinese food.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   Great.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   The food.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   I'm going for the food.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   You speak Chinese, right?
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   I studied Chinese in college, but I wouldn't say I speak it.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   Kevin's going to China for two weeks.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   So swole.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   Zai Nar.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I know he's going on a tea tasting expedition.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   I like tea, and I'm a fan of Kevin Rose.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   I like...
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   It's just an excuse.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   ...and I enjoyed drinking it.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   It's just an excuse.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   I guess to each their own to have their passions there.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   He's going to be there when I'm there.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   He's going to go and basically study tea farms.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   With Tim Ferriss, right?
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   With Pu-erh specifically for two weeks.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   Tim Ferriss and Glenn McElhose.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   They're not going to go to Beijing.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   They're not going to see the Great Wall.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   They're just going to go to tea farms.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   To the best of my knowledge, they're going to be planning with Pu-erh tea for two weeks.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   Tim Ferriss, by the way, speaks Chinese.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   So that'll...
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   Oh, he says he speaks everything.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   That would be pretty cool.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   No, actually, I bet he does because he studied...
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   Didn't he study kickboxing in China?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   I don't know.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   I think he did, yeah.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   Kickboxing?
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   Oh, geez.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   Wrong country for that.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   Oh, it is?
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   Yeah, he's...
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   Right, it is the wrong country for that.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   Well, he studied some...
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   What did he study?
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Kickboxing from Thailand.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Thailand, that's right.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   He went to Thailand.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   That's where he learned Chinese in Thailand?
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   Woo-hoo!
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   Thai-Chinese.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   No, I studied it.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   I can't wait.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   I'm going to bring my son.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   I'm going July 2nd through the 18th.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   I think that's when Kevin's going to be there.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   Oh, so you're going during the American...
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   July 4th, what is that?
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   United States?
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   July 4th, yeah.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   July 4th, yeah.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   July 4th, yeah.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   July 4th, yeah.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.440]   July 4th, when the United States celebrates its anniversary during that...
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.440]   You bet.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:35.280]   On the 4th of July, I'm going to be at the Raffles Hotel in Beijing.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   Come and see me.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.280]   Raffles?
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.280]   Raffles.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.360]   That's the English Colonial Hotel that used to be in...
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.360]   No, that was just in Singapore.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.360]   Yeah, it used to be...
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.360]   It's in Singapore.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.360]   It was started in Singapore.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.840]   You're just making this up as you go along.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.840]   No, I'm not.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.840]   It's in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Beijing.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.000]   It's supposed to be very nice.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.340]   And I'll light a...
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.340]   They have firecrackers there, you know.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.340]   I've heard that.
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.340]   Wow.
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:57.720]   They invented them.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.720]   What are you laughing at?
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.720]   Nothing.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.720]   I'm not sure at this point.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   Nothing.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.200]   Nothing to see here.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.200]   Move along.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:10.440]   All right, let's see what other stories we have in this compendium of technology news.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.440]   Oh, I love this story.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:26.480]   So the town of Helena, Montana had a policy that if you are a government job applicant,
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:32.640]   you have to turn over your username and password to Facebook, Twitter, all your social networking
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.640]   and web groups.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:38.920]   You have to tell them so they can log in and look at your Google, your Yahoo, your
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:45.560]   YouTube, your MySpace.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.720]   They decided to drop it.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.720]   They got a lot of heat.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.720]   I bet they did.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.800]   Would you hand over...
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.320]   Just to get a job, I guess in this tough economy, you might hand over.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.320]   What are you looking at now?
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.320]   You're not even looking at this.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:00.760]   I'm carefully examining it.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.760]   I think it was...
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.680]   Yeah, no, I'm glad that there was a public outcry against this.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.520]   We appreciate the concern many citizens have expressed regarding this practice and apologize
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.280]   for the negative impact this issue is having on the...
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.280]   It's the city of Bozeman, not Helena.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.280]   Yeah, Bozeman.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280]   Bozeman, Montana.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:21.000]   ACLU questioned legality.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.280]   I think that they didn't know what they were doing when some...
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.160]   I think just some bureaucrat put this up, this idea up, threw it out there and didn't
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.160]   think much about it.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.160]   It's sad.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.960]   We're only going to use this to verify application information.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.960]   Well, but it's...
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.480]   Yeah, you're going to use my...
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.480]   You need my...
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480]   My Facebook.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480]   I have your ATM password too.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.480]   Let me borrow your card.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:43.920]   I think somebody went, "Well, I like what they're doing there in Washington.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.040]   They're making everybody who wants to work in the federal government give up every email
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.800]   and every public posting they've ever made, so we should do that.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.680]   What's the easiest way to get all that information?"
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.680]   That's true.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.680]   Actually, that's the Obama White House did that.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.480]   But they didn't ask for your login and your password.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.480]   They just said, "It's handed over.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.480]   Hand over the material."
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.680]   I mean, the fact that they did that...
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:06.200]   I mean, okay, times are tough and people want jobs.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.120]   They want the security of a government job.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.000]   So I can see people turning over the information.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.800]   But the fact that the government there was asking for that is absolutely horrendous.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.080]   Funny thing is the Bozeman, representative of Congress from Bozeman, Montana, led the
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:24.240]   fight against the Patriot Act saying, "Trampled civil liberties."
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.920]   An excerpt from the city application form says, "Please list any and all current personal
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.920]   or business websites, web pages, and our memberships on any internet-based chat rooms, social clubs,
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.960]   or forums to include but not limited to Facebook, Google, Yahoo, YouTube, MySpace, etc."
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.960]   What's on Google?
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.040]   Well, if you had my Google password...
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040]   Google Docs, Gmail, all that.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.080]   No, but worse than that, if I didn't turn off the web history, you could see every site
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.760]   I've ever searched for on Google for the last five years.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.800]   Well, I think if I was a bureaucrat, I'd want to know that.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.240]   You deserve to know that.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.240]   We can't hire you.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.680]   I'm going to make that the policy here at Twitter.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.400]   You don't mind that, do you?
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.400]   No.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.400]   They're surfing porn right now.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.360]   They've all turned their avatars green.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.360]   I don't understand why.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.200]   Sometimes that's not the most embarrassing thing you can surf, John.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.200]   There's worse?
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.320]   Tell us, Patrick.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   I can't.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.320]   This is a family program.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.040]   I'm trying to think what it is now.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.040]   I'd like to go there.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   It's going to be bothering you all during your flight to China.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   Yes.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.040]   Let's see.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040]   When are you going?
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.040]   Next week?
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.040]   A week on Thursday.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.040]   From this Thursday?
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.640]   So you're not going this next weekend, though?
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   No.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640]   I'll be here next weekend.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   It'll be the last Twitter I'm part of for three weeks.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.840]   And then I think Alex is going to host some.
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.840]   But then, it's so unfortunate.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.840]   He's having a baby.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.840]   Oh, another one.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.840]   So I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.840]   We're going to have some stranger off the street.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:50.840]   You know, a weird thing happened to me yesterday.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.840]   My salad was stolen from right out here in the front.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.840]   Inside?
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.840]   I'm sorry?
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.840]   I had, I made a nice salad, a luscious salad.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.840]   And I had, it was in a brown box, just like this.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.840]   And I put it--
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840]   Hey, there's a salad.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.840]   Oh, there it is.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.840]   I put it on the refrigerator.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.840]   And you know, I am wont to leave the front door open so that anybody can wander in.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.840]   Because I feel like, you know, it's an open door policy here.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.840]   I went back at noon.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.840]   Plus, Leo carries a rather lower salary.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   Somebody stole your salad.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840]   Somebody stole the salad.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.840]   They didn't steal anything else.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.840]   They didn't steal a clock.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.840]   And I thought, oh, I'm an absent-minded guy.
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.840]   I must have, it's nowhere to be found.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.840]   I'm going to have to go back to the airport.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.840]   I'm going to have to go back to the airport.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.840]   It's nowhere to be found.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.840]   It was stolen.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.840]   And the calling confirmed.
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:29.840]   Yeah, when I came in, it was sitting there.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.840]   Somebody was hungry.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.840]   Are you sure that you didn't eat it and forgot that you did?
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:35.840]   I didn't eat it.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.680]   Somebody was hungry and took your salad.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.760]   I think that's what happened.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.840]   We have a salad thief here in Petaluma.
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.840]   Well, you know, it's at least as though you'd be worse.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.840]   Big city crime.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.840]   Yeah, I mean, give me a reason.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.840]   There's about $4 million.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.520]   I mean, you've already basically told everyone in the world who knows about the millions
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.120]   of dollars of technology.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.120]   And that the security and the alarm system doesn't work.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120]   I'm surprised you haven't been robbed.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120]   I'm surprised you haven't been robbed.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.120]   Or warn anybody or call the cops.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.120]   And I leave the door open, so come on.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.520]   This is like the people who Twitter that they're not at home and then they get robbed 10 minutes
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.520]   later.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.120]   So Ziff Davis is to shut down the Xtreme Tech website.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.120]   Isn't that sad?
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.120]   Yeah, actually, I'm very sad about that.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.120]   Lloyd Case out of work.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.120]   Robert Herron.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.120]   Robert's out of work.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.120]   We should have had Robert on the show.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.120]   We should have.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120]   Shoot.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.120]   Jason Cross, Jill Durham, a whole bunch of really good microphones over there.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.120]   He's actually probably at the NASCAR race right now.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.120]   Yeah, he's probably at the NASCAR race right now.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.120]   Yeah, he's just down the road on the races.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.120]   But yeah, Xtreme Tech did amazing content.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.120]   That was a great site.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.120]   Bill McCrone, didn't Bill start that?
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.120]   Yep.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.120]   Bill McCrone and Nick Stam was also involved.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120]   Nick Stam.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:37.120]   Nick Stam were frustrated that they couldn't generate the in-depth geek technical content.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.120]   The geek stuff.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.120]   They want to do something like Tom's Hardware or Non-Detect.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.120]   They were looking at those sites saying, "Where's Ziff Davis?
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:47.120]   We should be able to create sites at least as good."
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120]   And they did.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.120]   They made a darn good site.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.120]   Absolutely did.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.120]   Lloyd Case has kept this.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.120]   It's just been an amazing operation.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120]   It's really sad to see what's going on.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.120]   So was it lack of advertising?
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:01.120]   That's the only thing I can imagine.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.120]   I blame the advertisers more than I blame Ziff Davis for this.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.120]   These guys have been shouting and screaming and yelling and they don't advertise much anymore.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:15.120]   And then the other problem is a lot of the stuff that's become outsourced, so a lot of the products now are either made in China or they're Chinese.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.120]   And the Chinese, not that I want to generalize, Roger.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.120]   Oh, it's okay.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.120]   You've done it before.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.120]   Is they don't advertise.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.120]   Chinese companies don't advertise much.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.120]   Well, they don't have a brand.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.120]   I mean, can you think of--
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.120]   Acer does.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.120]   Acer, there's a few--
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120]   Lenovo does.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:38.120]   But you can't--most of the big Taipei manufacturers, you've got no idea who they are.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:43.120]   Asus is--they don't advertise much as HP for the same product.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.120]   I don't know.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.120]   They don't believe in advertising.
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.120]   You know, if you talk to the Chinese--I've said this before, I'll say it again.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:54.120]   You talk to any Chinese company about their marketing scheme, they all say the exact same answer.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120]   Best price.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.120]   Well, they don't need to.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:02.120]   I mean, people are going to come to them to buy--to manufacture stuff anyway.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.120]   So why spend the money on advertising?
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:10.120]   Well, I mean, even when they have their own brands, that would be a probably useful thing to do.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:18.120]   I'm sure they'll probably get around to that in maybe 10 years, but right now I think they're so cut up in manufacturing
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.120]   that that point probably has escaped them.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.120]   It's funny because you saw the same thing in Taiwan.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:30.120]   I mean, you know, before they were just general manufacturers, and then as they went up the food chain and became more specialized,
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:37.120]   they started to not market maybe under their own brand, but they would market under a foreign brand that they've purchased,
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:46.120]   you know, like Huffy. There's a Schwinn, but there's a couple other US bicycle manufacturers that are owned by Taiwanese firms,
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:50.120]   and they advertise under those brands because people are familiar with them.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.120]   They're not familiar with giant bicycles.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:02.120]   You know, it could be a case of them trying to, instead of build a brand, get enough money and buy one.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.120]   Well, anyway, so it's a story.
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.120]   It's sad. I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:11.120]   The worst part about it is that, you know, we don't – the kind of information – I'm finding this with news in general.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:17.120]   You know, you try to find out something that's going on about some specialty, like high tech in this case,
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:23.120]   and you look stuff up, and all you get are these advertising sites, these phony baloney sites that are trying to sell you something.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.120]   You've been using Bing again, haven't you?
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.120]   I'm sorry?
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.120]   I like Bing.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.120]   Oh, Bing.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:37.120]   I look at the results in Bing, and the only thing I can think is Bing's search engine algorithm isn't as – or, should I say,
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:43.120]   search engine optimization algorithm isn't nearly as robust as Google's is, because a lot of the stuff I've searched on,
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:50.120]   I get websites that are basically, you know – it's self-referential advertising sites rather than actual results.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.120]   Well, I remember that was a big problem on Google for a long time, and they finally –
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.120]   Well, you were in a Parker site.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.120]   Yeah, they finally solved it. I don't know how –
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.120]   I did a thing with Google the other day. I looked up something. They got a Parker site.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:58.120]   Really?
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.120]   Yeah, within the top five.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.120]   Remember, it was epidemic, like two years ago.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.120]   Yeah, they cut most of them out, but now it's like a crop.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:10.120]   I mean, that's like Matt Cutts' entire job is running the team that basically beats that algorithm.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.120]   I was wondering, do they do it algorithmically, or do they manually just block these guys?
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.120]   I believe they do it algorithmically.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.120]   Interesting.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.120]   There's probably ways to look at a site and say, "This is a Parker site."
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.120]   I don't think there's – there's so many of them working so hard, I don't think you could manually do it, although anything's possible.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.120]   Right.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:35.120]   And secretly somewhere deep in the bowels of Google is a giant room full of librarians that individually put your links together every time you ask for a result.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:46.120]   Speaking of people out of work, our good friend Martin Sargent is trying to get a darn good job at Murphy Good Winery. Did you see this? Is Murphy Good Good Wines? Yes.
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:50.120]   Murphy – yeah, actually, there's been a number of good wines from that winery.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.120]   Thank you.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.120]   I just noticed the bottle was –
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.120]   Why, are we – are they sponsoring this now?
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.120]   No.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.120]   Well, then what difference does it make?
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:02.120]   They're doing a thing. I think it's really cool. You remember in Australia – Australia did this, right?
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.120]   Yes.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:08.120]   The best job in the world, and you had to apply, and you'd get to be, I don't know, a lighthouse keeper. Some of it was really not such a good job.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   You were a caretaker of an island, I believe.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.120]   Yeah. It didn't really sound like that good a job when you really boiled it down.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.120]   I don't know. Callie Lewis wanted it really badly.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.120]   Yeah, she wanted it bad.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.120]   She wanted what bad?
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.120]   This lighthouse keeper job.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.120]   Why?
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:24.120]   Well, that's my question. It doesn't seem like such a good job, frankly, but this is a good job.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.120]   Maybe she's more misanthropic than any of us ever knew.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.120]   She really doesn't like people.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.120]   This is a good job.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.120]   I hate people.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.120]   You get to – you get to – they're looking for a –
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.120]   A social media marketing representative for a winery.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:47.120]   And you get to live in the winery for six months. You get paid 60 grand. And so what they're doing is they're asking people to apply by making a video. And so our own –
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.120]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:58.120]   Television's Martin Sargent made a video. Now, he is leading in the votes, but you've got to go vote. Go to Murphy – actually, go right to the website, areallygoodjob.com.
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:01.120]   Oh, and we'll get him – he's got the job if we have the Twitter on.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.120]   Well, I think that there's any more to it than that, but I bet we could get 10,000.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:12.120]   Well, they're going to narrow it down to 50 finalists that I guess are selected primarily by the winery, but they're going to obviously – they're going to pay attention to who the people are interested in.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.120]   Well, sure, because if you're trying to get a social maven, you're going to want somebody who can get 10,000 votes.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.120]   And then each of those 50 people –
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:21.120]   We'll have them hire Ashton Kutcher. Somebody ought to hire Ashton Kutcher.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.120]   Each of those 50 people writes an essay. I'm not sure what the instructions are.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:28.120]   Well, we know how good a writer Marty is. His video is very funny.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.120]   And then they fly out the top 10 finalists and do some kind of –
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.120]   Are they going to do a TV show around this or what it sounds like to me?
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.120]   I don't know. But you know what? I mean, they've already gotten –
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.120]   On Fox Reality.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:45.120]   Look at the press they've gotten. I mean, not just us talking about it, but look at the attention they've been getting just for doing this. They've obviously got – they know what's going on from a Web2O standpoint already.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:51.120]   You're right. Whoever thought this up really is probably the real person, right? The job that Marty's trying to get.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:58.120]   But we want Marty to get this job. So help him out. Just go to a really good job.com. You can only vote once per email address.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:05.120]   But I notice you can vote as many email addresses as you have. So again, that slants it towards people who are more Internet savvy.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.120]   Yeah, good.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.120]   So what's he doing? Is he looking for work?
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.120]   He's looking for work, yeah.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.120]   You got a job for him?
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.120]   No, I wish.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:19.120]   He does a show here. He does This Week in Fun with Sarah every Friday. But you know, that's not enough to live on.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.120]   This Week in Fun.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:33.120]   As you well know. It's not exactly a paycheck you can depend on. But yeah, he does This Week in Fun. It's very good. And he's doing some other stuff, I think. But in fact, isn't he on contract? I think with Revision 3 he does some stuff.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:38.120]   A couple of things. And then I'm not sure all of what he's doing.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.120]   But anyway, he could be doing this.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.120]   That's a good gimmick.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:52.120]   That's a great gimmick. So give him a, help Marty out. A really good, yep, a really good job.com. Murphy Goodwater.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.120]   Okay, what else we got for news here?
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.120]   That's it. That's all. That's it.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.120]   That's it?
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.120]   Yeah. You said you wanted to go early because it's Father's Day.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.120]   No, I didn't say I wanted to go early. I said, no, it wasn't the Father's Day thing.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.120]   It's the fear of the NASCAR traffic.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.120]   The fear of NASCAR traffic.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.120]   There's a big race at Infineon here.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:11.120]   Yeah. It's the road race. I should have gone to this thing every year, you know, DuPont says, "I should come to the race." And I always forget about it until last minute.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.120]   They're the ones who sponsor Jeff Gordon. I could hang out with him.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.120]   Oh, that'd be cool. He's a very handsome man.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.120]   I don't know about that.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.120]   Number 24.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.120]   Yes, number 24.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.120]   Yes. You knew I knew that.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.120]   How could you not?
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.120]   How could you not know that?
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120]   I didn't know that.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.120]   And Patrick, you race.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.120]   In the desert.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.120]   Well, this is a road race, not a race where you turn left the whole time.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.120]   Yeah, you go back and forth and you go up. In fact, it goes up 10 stories. There's a hill.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.120]   Really?
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.120]   And it comes down 10 stories to a left turn.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.120]   It's a pretty awesome track.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.120]   It's a very awesome track.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.120]   It's not Formula One type of stuff, though.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.120]   No, it's a stock car.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:48.120]   Oh, yeah, they're driving the big stock cars on a Formula One track.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.120]   Yeah, they do everything at Sears Point.
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.120]   Yeah, it's a road course.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.120]   Oh, I thought that sounds like actually a much more fun race than the --
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.120]   I think so, too. I mean, at the round and around and around.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.120]   Yeah, it's kind of boring.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.120]   Well, technically, you're still going around and around. You're just going up and down and around and around.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.120]   You're doing it with lefts and rights.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.120]   There's right-hand turns. That's all I care about.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.120]   There's only actually about three or four of the NASCAR guys that are good on road courses.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.120]   That's hard. It's a very different skill, I would imagine.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.120]   We're driving 200 miles an hour, even if you're only turning left.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:17.120]   So I think it's the one of two that is actually part of the NASCAR season.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.120]   Do they go as fast? They probably don't go as fast.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.120]   No, they do. They average about 90.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.120]   Oh, so it's much slower. I could do that.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.120]   Oh, sure.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.120]   Oh, here you can. Can I bring my Lexus?
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.120]   Robbie Gordon --
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.120]   He's blown off the road by these guys.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.120]   It's been really funny watching.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:37.120]   Robbie Gordon released the in-car footage from the Baja 500 in his trophy truck, which is insanely fast.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:43.120]   And a friend of mine who's pretty cocky, he's a pretty talented driver, was just like, "Oh my God."
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:50.120]   He said, "I almost peed on myself just watching how fast he was and the passes he made and the lines he took."
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.120]   And I'm like, "Dude, Robbie Gordon's used to driving 200 miles an hour at the Indy 500 in NASCAR.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.120]   Doing 85 in a trophy truck has to feel like it's standing still."
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:03.120]   Also, he's been doing this nonstop for like 15 years. One of the most talented drivers in the world.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.120]   Maybe I could ride my trike. My Terra trike. It'd be good for that.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.120]   Do you have one of those little --
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.120]   Ah, yeah. I haven't shown you my Terra trike.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.120]   No, it's just like that ball you're rolling around on right now.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:18.120]   How can you start rolling around in this sensuous way when you start talking about the trike? What's the deal?
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:22.120]   Because you know what it is about real bicycles? They hurt your bum. Those seats, they're not comfortable.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:26.120]   And this -- a Terra trike -- so you're sitting. It's like --
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.120]   It's a recumbent.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.120]   It's a recumbent. I have memory foam. It's just really comfy. I'm sitting there.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.120]   What crap. It's a grand.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.120]   Yeah, it's a thousand bucks.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.120]   It's actually not expensive.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.120]   You've got nothing but money in the --
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.120]   Bikes are expensive these days.
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.120]   -- apparently.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.120]   No, actually, they sent me that one.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.120]   Oh, look. Your face is on the front page.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:43.120]   Wait. Does that affect the way you responded right now to that?
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.120]   You bet. You bet.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.120]   Well, what are you going to do about it?
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.120]   I'm going to plug it like crazy.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:53.120]   No, they made it -- they said to try it for 30 days and you could buy it after 30 days if you really like it.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.120]   Yeah, sure.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.120]   I do really like it, but I have a feeling they're not going to ask for a check at this point.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.120]   My question is --
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120]   Why would they?
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:04.120]   With one of those style bikes, I mean, you sit kind of low. Do you ever get --
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.120]   It's terrifying. It's terrifying.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.120]   Are you ever afraid some car is just going to run over you?
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.120]   I have the little orange flag on a stick on the back.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:14.120]   I have two pennants. It looks like the circus came to town.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:20.120]   I have two pennants waving, flapping behind me. I have a horn that sounds like a truck horn.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.120]   I go, "Eeeeh!"
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:29.120]   I mean, literally, you pump it up with your bicycle pump until it's 100 PSI, and then you press the button and it's really loud, definitely loud.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.120]   I have lights that blink on every surface.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.120]   But the problem is you're this -- you're like --
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.120]   You're eight inches off the ground.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:40.120]   You're eight inches -- you're really -- you're like down here going, "Eeeeh!"
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:45.120]   Some guy -- I'm driving -- Petaluma has -- they have this event called American Graffiti Days.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.120]   You know, you would probably like this, Patrick. All the old cars. Everybody brings their old cars.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:52.120]   Beautifully, beautiful, cherry, classic cars.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.120]   And I foolishly rode my trike down to the --
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.120]   Sucking exhaust fumes the entire way.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:04.120]   And some guy in an F-150 shies at a Gatorade container in my head as I'm fiddling down the road.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.120]   He threw you -- threw a can at you?
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.120]   Yeah. Really? Yeah. He missed.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.120]   Hey, bicyclist.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.120]   Yeah, well, I kind of realized. I looked like --
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.120]   Did you get his license plate?
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.120]   No.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.120]   I chased him.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.120]   He hit him with his license.
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.120]   Chased -- "Come on, you --"
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:45.120]   "I'll get you, you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! I
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:51.120]   Great idea. Just snip it. He wouldn't even know. Roll up next -- and then about 50 yards later, you can wave and you go by.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.120]   As you pedal by.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.120]   But you got a flat! Here's your Gatorade bottle! You dropped it!
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:02.120]   We were shooting video while driving up here and we stopped at -- we were rolling video in the car.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:07.120]   We were cut off by a cop. Then we stopped at a red light and then he just ran the red line. We have it all on video.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.120]   Oh, that's a YouTube.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.120]   Let's post it.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.120]   That's YouTube.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.120]   Post it.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.120]   All right. That's -- you got it on video. But cops are allowed to do that. You're allowed to do that.
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.120]   You're allowed to name so the cop doesn't track you down.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:23.120]   Yeah. Yeah. So, I know the TerraTrac's really fun. I really enjoy it. But it does look a little goofy when you have all those pennants and stuff. You kind of look like a nut.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.120]   But I love riding. I really do.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.120]   Everybody can mock the pennants, but if you don't get run over, they're working.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.120]   And if you do, they -- then what?
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.120]   They're not working.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.120]   They'll make the corpse easier to find.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.120]   Yes, exactly. Bury me with my pennants.
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.120]   Aw.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.120]   Pre's doing pretty well. Well, yes and no.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.120]   It has mixed review.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.120]   I loved it. It was a nice handset, I thought.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.120]   Yeah, but you got one early, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.120]   I did. I got it one day early.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.120]   You got it one day early, which is going to cloud the review.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:58.120]   I'm sorry. Could you -- yes, actually, Seamus has just wandered in with my wife.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.120]   Seamus, that's great. No, I love it. It's beautiful.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120]   So, I'm sorry. Let me -- I want to --
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.120]   It's a work of art, actually.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.120]   I didn't like it.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.120]   You didn't like it?
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.120]   No, I like the iPhone better.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:12.120]   The iPhone feels a little clunky compared to the Pre, but on the other hand, functionality-wise, I think the iPhone wins, except for multitasking.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.120]   Two things.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.120]   I think the keyboard's too small.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.120]   Yeah, I wouldn't use a keyboard.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.120]   Actually, because it doesn't have predictive text, I think the iPhone is actually more accurate because of the predictive text.
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.120]   But I do love the background tasks and the messaging is fantastic.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.120]   I miss that, actually. I wish it had the messaging of the Pre.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   Anyway, 700,000 downloads of applications. That's the good news.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   But --
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.120]   How many applications are there?
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.120]   In the --
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.120]   Not very many.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.120]   Less than 50, I think.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.120]   Yeah. More than when the iPhone came out, we should point out.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120]   Well, the iPhone didn't allow --
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.120]   Didn't have apps.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   Yeah, you had to pack it.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:51.120]   A survey of retail sites reported that most Palm Pre owners are already Sprint subscribers. I guess that's not really a surprise.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120]   No.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.120]   That's one thing the iPhone's done so well for AT&T.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.120]   If you were on Sprint, it seems a no-brainer to get the Pre.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.120]   It is definitely the phone to get if you're on Sprint already, or you don't want to leave Sprint, or you're willing to move to Sprint.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   It is not apparently bringing new customers in, though.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.120]   And Sprint has lost more than 4 million contract customers in the last year. It's hemorrhaging.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.120]   Yeah, Sprint's got problems.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.120]   So that's not --
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.120]   They need to hire that guy without those big people that stand behind him.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.120]   With the glasses.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:26.120]   I have a Sprint EVDO modem, and they kind of made me really sad when they gave up. They were the last one to give up on unlimited data on their EVDO contracts.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.120]   They're 5G's now, too, right?
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.120]   What's that?
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.120]   5 gigabytes limited now?
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.120]   Yeah. Like everybody.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.120]   I just ordered the MiFi. I can't wait until that comes. That is just a neat device.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.120]   The MiFi?
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.120]   Oh.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.120]   What is it?
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.120]   So Verizon and Sprint both sell them. It's about the size of a credit card. It fits in your front pocket.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.120]   It's an EVDO modem with a Wi-Fi access point built into it.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:53.120]   So you put it in your pocket. It runs four or five hours on the battery, full-time.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.120]   Put it in your pocket. It's got a rechargeable.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:04.120]   And now you can use Wi-Fi on your iPhone to get to EVDO. So you could use it on any device. You can get up to five people can use it. It's really nice.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.120]   So it's kind of like a virtual tether.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:11.120]   Yeah. Yeah. It's $60 a month, 5 gigabyte limit, just like your EVDO card.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.120]   How much does the hardware cost?
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:15.120]   It was under $100. It's not hugely expensive. Verizon and Sprint both sell them.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.120]   For him, it's free.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.120]   I'm getting the cradle point modem with my Wi-Fi.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.120]   I have a cradle point. You want to borrow my cradle point?
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.120]   Absolutely. They are the bomb.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:26.120]   Now that I have the Mi-Fi, it's the same idea, but you just put -- the whole thing is in this credit card sized unit.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.120]   But please borrow the cradle point.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:32.120]   If it's credit card sized, then the packaging of the Mi-Fi is not bad. The cradle point is.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.120]   No, it's really cool.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:37.120]   If you want to use EVDO with a router, external router, that is the one to get.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.120]   That's great. I've used it that way for a long time.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:43.120]   Actually, does anybody other than Leo and I carry an EVDO modem? You carry one.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.120]   Mm-hmm.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.120]   No.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.120]   John?
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.120]   No. No. No. No. No.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.120]   John likes to be offline.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:52.120]   I'm not -- I do like to be offline. That's your goody box at that big drawer?
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.120]   Hey, what else do you want?
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.120]   I don't need anything. Unless you got a pop --
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.120]   A chumby!
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.120]   A pop screen.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.120]   He's got a salad in there for some reason.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.120]   Chumby's in front.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.120]   One of these little pop --
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.120]   A salad! There's a salad in there!
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.120]   Is there a salad spinner in there?
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.120]   One of these little pop screens would be ideal.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:07.120]   I don't have any more of those. I only have the big ones.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.120]   You want a big one?
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.120]   Sure.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.120]   [Laughter]
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is a pop screen.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.120]   That's a good one, though. See, the ones we have, the metal ones, are not as good as that one.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.120]   That one's like a ladies' fine silk stocking.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.120]   Yeah, it looks what it looks like.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.120]   You can make one of those out of a piece of coat hanger and a ladies' fine silk stocking.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.120]   Absolutely.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   Should you be more budget-oriented?
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.120]   Absolutely.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:35.120]   This is pretty budget-oriented, don't you think? Mooching it from Leo?
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.120]   [Laughter]
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.120]   That's very funny. Not everyone has the opportunity to mooch from Leo.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.120]   Just take it. That's all I care about.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:43.120]   Although the front door is open and the alarm system is of questionable use.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.120]   Free salad, but nobody gets my cupcake.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.120]   And he's right here in downtown Petaluma.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.120]   Don't give that the address. That's our one security method.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:54.120]   Well, the pit bull, I think, will do the trick.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.120]   Actually, I got your address off of Google Maps.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.120]   Is that right? Is that true?
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.120]   No, I just wanted to watch Leo's expression.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.120]   That's because he knows it could be true.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:09.120]   It is true. In fact, you can even see a picture of it if you look for Twit Cottage on Google Maps.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.120]   Oh, really?
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.120]   You get the street view and everything.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:14.120]   You better get some blocks for this place.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.120]   Ah, it's Petaluma.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.120]   Although I have to say, the fact is, you're insured.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.120]   We're heavily insured.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.120]   And who's going to lug this stuff out of here?
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.120]   I mean, that thing, that mixer over there must weigh 100 pounds.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:25.120]   Exactly. No, nobody's going to take anything. People like me.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.120]   Well, yeah, you're likable.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.120]   All except Mike Harrington. He doesn't like me.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.120]   But everybody else likes me.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.120]   Does Mike Harrington like anyone?
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.120]   No, he likes me. We made it up. We kissed and made up.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.120]   You made it up?
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.120]   He said I was handsome and had a nice voice. Was that weird?
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.120]   If he said that, yes, it is weird.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.120]   I didn't say that. It's very weird.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:43.120]   He said you're handsome and have a nice voice.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.120]   It made me a little queasy.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.120]   It's kind of creepy.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.120]   Who is this?
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.120]   Mike Harrington.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.120]   Wow.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.120]   Kind of creeps me out, too.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.120]   And I've never talked to him, either.
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.120]   A lot of women think you have a nice voice.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.120]   Yeah, I have a voice for women.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.120]   Yeah, you do.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.120]   Voice for radio.
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.120]   And apparently Mike Harrington.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.120]   Women and Mike Harrington.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.120]   I've never seen Mike and a woman at the same time.
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.120]   You know, when we were on the air, you haven't signed the show off yet.
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:12.120]   Oh, I felt like I had.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:13.120]   You haven't.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.120]   I felt like the show degenerated so much that it was really over.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.120]   It slowed down so much.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.120]   It was so bad.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.120]   When I got up and left the microphone, I figured, that's it. It's over.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.120]   Well, I want to thank you all for joining us.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:25.120]   I hope we haven't bored you too terribly,
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:30.120]   but it's fun to celebrate our 200th episode with guys who have been with me since the beginning.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:32.120]   Actually, John, you joined us on episode three.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:35.120]   Yeah, I was banned from the first couple.
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.120]   I don't know if it was that.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:41.120]   I do remember the famous episode where your phone or your Skype stopped working,
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:45.120]   and I was reading your comments into the microphone.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.120]   Oh, right.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.120]   You were chatting them.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.120]   Yeah, I was messaging in.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.120]   That was classic.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:52.120]   Hey, I'm offline. Help me.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.120]   Patrick has been here since the beginning, as has Roger.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:59.120]   Roger and Patrick and David and I started this whole thing at the 21st Amendment Brew Pub
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:02.120]   right after a Mac World Expo in January 2005.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.120]   With a DAT report, right?
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.120]   Four years.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.120]   And then I remember coming here, you had a little soundboard,
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:11.120]   and half of every set up would be you going, "That's aux one, that's aux two."
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.120]   In the first year, it was a disaster.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.120]   It would take us an hour to start a show.
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.120]   It was ridiculous.
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.120]   Nothing worked. It was all crazy.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:20.120]   Now it's like a machine.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.120]   It is practically like a machine.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.120]   Yeah, except you keep buying new stuff.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.120]   We still have these XLT cameras.
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.120]   You know what's happening?
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.120]   Yeah, the cameras are going to...
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   Okay, so the next stage is Telos.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.120]   They're the folks who make the...
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.120]   Yeah, the ISDN stuff.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:34.120]   I think you still have one, a little Telos box somewhere.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:39.120]   They called and said, "We'd really like to replace your analog stuff with digital."
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:43.120]   So we're getting a Telos Axia mixer, which that will come in in August.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.120]   And everything will be digital, except for the microphones, obviously.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:50.120]   They're analog, but they'll be immediately digitized and all go into this digital system.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:55.120]   And then it's time to replace the cameras with HD and the TriCaster with HD TriCaster.
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:58.120]   And by then... I don't know.
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.120]   By then it'll be another trip to China.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.120]   What do you use the green screen for back there?
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.120]   You want to see?
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.120]   Sure, maybe.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.120]   No, no, not really.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.120]   I think another...
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.120]   We make pornos on the weekend.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.120]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.120]   Another twit...
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.120]   This is amazing.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.120]   ...is in the can.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:40.120]   [music]
