[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   There wasn't much this week, but we're going to do it anyway.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Fortunately, we have a great panel who will fill beautifully.

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Hello, Jason!
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Hey, thanks for having me, Leo.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Always a pleasure.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Even when there's not much to talk about, well, plenty to go through.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   How are things in Louisville?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yeah, great.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Of course, Louisville has become part of the epicenter of the world at the moment
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   because of the events with everything that's happened here.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And they're still happening.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   There's some big protests there.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Are they still going on?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   They are still going on, for sure.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yes.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   We have protests still in a little petaloma, but there's only about five or six people.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But it's okay.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's good.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's good.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's just keep--
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Keep in the flame alive.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Sam Aboule-Samit is here from Ipsilanti, Michigan.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   He is riding on a surfboard with his dog, Boomer.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Hello, Sam.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Daisy.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Daisy.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Hi, Leo.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   How are you doing?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Is that a life jacket Daisy's wearing?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   That is a life jacket.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   When we go out on the paddleboard, she wears a life jacket.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   She can swim, but just, you know, for out in the middle of the lake,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I'd rather be safe.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   You don't want to have to swim back to shore with a dog under your arm.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   That would be hard.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And are you on a stand-up paddleboard?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Is that your thing?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I'm impressed.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   You like it, yeah.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I always see the people at sunrise, and there's a little steam coming off the lake, and they're
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   paddling around with their dog, Daisy, or whatever.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And it just looks so peaceful.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And I go, "Thank God I'm here with my cold pizza because I don't want to be out there."
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's good to see you, Sam.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Welcome.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Sam is our car guy from Guide House Insights.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   He's the host of great car podcasts called Wheel bearings.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Hey, look who's here to add some spice to our show.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Sheera Lazar.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Peaceinside.live.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Hi, Sheera.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Hi.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Happy July 4th weekend.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   From beautiful Venice Beach, California.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Also an epicenter of excitement.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Always.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.600]   I mean, a lot going on Venice.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.000]   A lot of people having parties without masks.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It's really exhilarating.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It might be hard being so close to the beach, and you don't feel safe going down to the
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   beach.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.520]   Well, I usually go during the week, and there's actually not a lot of people there.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.000]   I'll just jog and just, you know, be there alone.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   But they did close the beaches this weekend.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I saw some people, I think it was more like Manhattan Beach or Hennanyan Beach, Sunbathing,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   because they couldn't get to the beach.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Sunbathing on the sidewalk.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah, people will go as close as they can to the beach.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Yeah, there's a lot going on here.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.160]   I feel like people still think that they're not going to get anything, so they're just
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.000]   continuing to live life as usual, because it hasn't, like, even though it's hidden, California,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.840]   we have spikes of COVID, but like, there's these little bubbles that think they're just
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.560]   like immune to it.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.160]   And I kind of understand it's like, I give up.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.160]   They're saying I give up.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.240]   They're saying I know, but I give up.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.800]   And if I get sick, I get sick.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.880]   I'm keeping it safe, you guys.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.440]   I'm trying to lead by example.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.000]   Please, thank you.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Nice.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Please, because I don't want anyone I know to get sick.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Appreciate it.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.480]   It's not, this doesn't sound like much fun.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.080]   It was a very weird 4th of July yesterday.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.000]   I have to say.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It was.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It was, there was fireworks everywhere last night, you know, all around this.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It was like a war neighborhood.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.320]   And from, and you know, Gazy was not appreciating.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   No, I bet.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.520]   You know, nor were any of the other dogs in the neighborhood.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   Oh.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.280]   You know, and I saw, I saw videos that were posted this morning of LA, you know, an aerial
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.360]   video of LA with all these fireworks going off everywhere.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.360]   It was insane.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.160]   It just shows if you don't have official fireworks, people will make their own.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.120]   And I don't know which is worse, honestly.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.480]   I watched CNN had a like three hour fireworks plus singing thing.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.160]   And I felt like it was in just this weird dystopian sci-fi novel because everybody's
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.720]   performing from their living room and even, and the weird thing is the New York fireworks,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.120]   the way they did Macy's fireworks, they didn't want people to gather during the fireworks.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.400]   So they held them at random times over the past couple of weeks.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.560]   They would just have a pop up fireworks show and recorded it.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.720]   And so then what we saw was the Empire staple.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.000]   And I guess that part was love was shooting off fireworks and then videos of the other
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   fireworks.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.360]   It was, it was, you know, it's not merely that we're quarantining and, you know, and
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.440]   protests, not merely all of that stuff.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:07:02.080]   It's, it all, it's also how technology has combined with it to make this very strange.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.320]   I feel like we're living in the, in a weird future, you know, like a, I feel like we're
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:14.520]   living in the deep fake future kind of like, like all of this is simulated.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.600]   So just, what is real?
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   What is real?
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   What is real?
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   What is real?
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   Right?
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.760]   I mean, Kanye West is running for president.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.760]   Okay, exactly.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.760]   I rest my case.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.200]   It's like, it's like things like that.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.280]   And then you told me that the Bitcoin guy.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.160]   Yeah, Brock Pierce.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.840]   And I don't know if this is a joke, but I am friends with him on Facebook and he just
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.440]   announced today it's like in his fee that he's running for president and he has a whole
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   official site.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   So I just-
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.680]   It's hard for me to take seriously somebody who wants to be president but couldn't get
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.880]   it together enough to file on time.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.880]   It's like, it's like you're going to have the president, my dog, the dog ate my homework
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880]   president.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.520]   Like, yeah, I'll get around to it.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   When's election day?
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   Okay, I'll get a-
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.120]   The headline from point telegraphs.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.160]   The headline from point telegraph is Brock Pierce jumps into 2020 US presidential last
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.160]   minute.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.600]   Neither he nor Kanye are on any ballots because it's too late.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.440]   So it's bizarre.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.440]   Just bizarre that, and I just feel like that's a little bit disqualifying.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.720]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:31.320]   But if you couldn't figure out how to get together in time to file, Jason.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.720]   Real imagine it's all just about getting attention.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.600]   Yeah, that's really what's going on.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.360]   Who could imagine somebody running for president as a publicity sit-time and then actually getting
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   elected?
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   Well, that's true.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   Well, that would never happen.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.920]   That's not this country.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.240]   No, that couldn't.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.720]   I will never forget that great movie.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.920]   It's worth watching with Robert Redford as the candidate.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.080]   It's called.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.960]   And he busts his hump.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.320]   You know, they pick him because he's so good looking and he'd be a perfect candidate and
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.000]   that goes through the whole campaign and everything.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.080]   And he gets elected.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.080]   And then he says, and then it's the end of the last line in the movie is now what?
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.880]   It's like, we worked so hard to get here, but we really needed to think about what we
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.080]   were going to do once we got there.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   It's a weird world.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.720]   But I think that the technology salt is making it just weirder.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.320]   There was an article today in the Sunday New York Times about the Skype shirt.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   You know what?
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   When I read it, I go, oh, yeah, I do that.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.040]   Do you keep a shirt like just out of camera range so that when suddenly you've got to
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:39.360]   do our Zoom shirt, maybe they called it, suddenly you've got to do a Zoom call so you
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.040]   throw it on.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.160]   And you know, there's nothing below the waist, but no one sees that.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.200]   You just have a nice, maybe it's a guy thing.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.400]   It's probably a guy thing.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   I do.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.640]   I mean, I've got some shirts to closet in my office.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.640]   And you know, when when I get an email, you know, somebody wants to or call somebody wants
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.560]   to do an interview, you know, I just reach in, grab grab a shirt, put on a clean shirt
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.320]   and you know, turn on the lights and boy we go.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.040]   Here's the New York Times Sunday time space.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.200]   The video call is starting time to put on your Zoom shirt.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   Oh my God.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   Wow.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.160]   Sam, only has T shirts for this show.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.160]   Sam, you know what?
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.880]   He believes in honesty for this show.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.280]   He does not put on a Zoom shirt.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.000]   He, you know, so they, they talk.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.440]   I have like my church of the three petals shirt.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   Oh, I like that.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.480]   What are the three petals?
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.160]   The gas breaking clutch.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.040]   Oh, PED as every as every proper car should have.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:47.280]   I am so stupid that who was, what car was it that had a pause play buttons on their petals?
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.280]   Somebody did.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.600]   I saw it and I thought, I have a shirt with that.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   Maybe that was it.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   Maybe I saw your T shirt.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   I couldn't figure it out.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   What?
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   Oh, they're pedal.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   I get it.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   Pause play.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   Do you have a rewind pedal?
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.800]   Yeah, that's the brake pedal.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.440]   So rewind into 20.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.440]   I don't know.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   It was a good year.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440]   15 was okay.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   I don't know.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.240]   I feel like 2009 was.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.360]   There you go.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   That's a good year.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.760]   Let's rewind to 2009.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.800]   94 was a good year.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.680]   2009 was a giant financial crash.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.320]   Oops.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.080]   I was just thinking about it.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.960]   Was it a good year if you were at Sheerson Lehman, but it might have been a, yeah.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.400]   What do you graduate from college?
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   Is that what it was?
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   No.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.920]   It was a good old days when we were all just like hanging out.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   And the good old days.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.200]   And partying and on each other's podcast.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.720]   Like when Twitter was just starting.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   It was fun.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   Wasn't it?
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   Those are good days.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   Maybe 2000.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   Maybe before the crash like 2006 or seven.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   Yes.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   There you go.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   That was a good one.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Two.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.760]   Seven was a lot of, you know, optimism.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.560]   That was when people still liked tech.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   Yes.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.760]   And people still thought tech isn't doing good stuff for us.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.760]   Big tech was the future.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.240]   This is going to be great.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.240]   It's going to save the world.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   What people want.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   Valley bag was around.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   There's gossip for tech.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   Valley bag.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   Jeez.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.240]   Jeez.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.000]   I don't know if that's anything to celebrate.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Okay.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   A dig.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.720]   Windows Vista came out.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.720]   Dig.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.560]   Was dig still around?
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.280]   To, don't let's not forget the iPhone came out in 2007.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   It was kind of a water.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.400]   It was a watershed year.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.200]   I remember the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.680]   And literally, like, people were just walking around.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.640]   A lot of people that are now, you know, hitting away and they're bonkers.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.480]   Just walking around that show all, you know, just shooting the breeze in the hallways.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.040]   Ellen DeGeneres did the world's most famous selfie at the Oscars.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   Remember that?
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   Her arm wasn't long enough.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.040]   So what somebody did?
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   With the galaxy.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.040]   It was a Samsung or something.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.680]   Is this a Samsung wall, other than Jane?
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.120]   Oh, I think it was, well, I don't, maybe it was.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.320]   She has to do with a note, I think, wasn't it?
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   Was it a note?
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   I got that one wrong.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.920]   WWE 23, WrestleMania 23.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.760]   I'm just looking for the Dow closed above 13,000 points.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.960]   That just shows you how weird this world is.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.840]   It's now well over 20,000.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.200]   Although there was an interesting headline I saw this morning.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.320]   I get the medium daily digest of articles I should be reading.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.960]   I didn't read the whole thing, but the headline was that the stock market has become a Ponzi
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:47.520]   scheme because so many of these insanely highly valued companies are companies that
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.720]   don't have any dividends.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.440]   It's all just about the growth in the stock price, which really, in a way, it kind of
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.800]   is like a Ponzi scheme.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.000]   It's just waiting for the next sucker to come along and tell you more of the stock you bought.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.240]   It doesn't seem related to the fundamentals of a company anymore.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.240]   No.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.720]   Warren Buffett must be like, what's going on?
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:19.280]   That was the peak of-- in October was the peak of the Dow before the late 2000s recession.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.240]   Apple released Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.960]   The best part of 2007 was the Red Sox winning the World Series.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   That was good stuff.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.560]   Some kind of sports ball reference.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.000]   Sports ball.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.840]   So Apple is now at Mac OS 11.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.160]   They've gone to 11.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.960]   And some interesting-- I'm starting to see companies-- or not companies bloggers like
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.840]   Neil Seibart.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   This is his post from the first.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.040]   Apple is pulling away from the competition.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.640]   Now I'm ready for you to argue against all that because we've been talking-- we've been
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:04.760]   breathing the Apple reality distortion field the last couple of weeks after the WWDC
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.880]   a week ago Monday, but two weeks ago, this coming Monday.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.840]   But honestly, this moved to all Apple hardware.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.240]   Apple's silicon all the way down and all Apple software seems like something that only a
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.680]   company like Apple could pull off.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.200]   Now maybe a number of people wrote me said, who cares?
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.760]   AMD is going to be great.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.280]   I want to rise in and I don't care.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:38.160]   But it feels like Apple is firing on all six cylinders right now.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:47.080]   And by the way, they have a six-cylinder car, not a four-cylinder or eight-year-old.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.000]   I say that because they have accessories, the watch and the pods, the phones, the pads,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.160]   the laptops, the iMac and the desktop.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.400]   This is Neil's diagram.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:04.240]   He says Apple changed their product strategy prior to last year and the year before.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   They were a pull strategy.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.240]   The whole idea was the phone is so dominant.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.200]   It's just going to drag the rest of the products into success.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.600]   And then a couple of years ago, they said, no, we're going to fire on all six fronts.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   We're going to make a Mac Pro.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.800]   We're going to make a top-of-the-line iMac, top-of-the-line laptop.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.120]   We're going to make best-in-class tablets.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:29.480]   We're going to -- and then all of it is supported by services.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.960]   And it seems to be working from an economic point of view.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.280]   I don't know if this is a Ponzi scheme too, Sam, but from an economic point of view.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:43.400]   I think the risk -- I wouldn't necessarily include Apple and that Ponzi scheme group,
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.840]   because they actually have been paying dividends for the last several years.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.000]   Yeah, but they also are taking their cash and buying more stock.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   So they are pumping their stock price.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.840]   Yeah, I mean, in that way, though, they're still returning --
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   Investors give their money.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.720]   -- providing returns to their stockholders.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.000]   So whether it's directly as the dividend or buying doing stock buybacks, either way.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.960]   But the risk, I think, with what they're doing with going all in on Apple Silicon is,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.160]   they're literally are going all in.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.800]   There is no plan B. There's no fallback position.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   Yes, it's got to see.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   It's wrong.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   Yeah, it's got to see.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.600]   And we've seen Intel do this in the past.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.080]   They've gone all in on some technology.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:30.520]   And for years, x86, they just kept churning and churning and getting faster and faster,
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.240]   more power efficient until they stalled.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.000]   It worked great until it didn't.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:46.600]   And at least, if you're at least partially relying on other companies, if you're not
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:54.520]   totally locked into some proprietary technology, you have the opportunity to shift gears, if
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.320]   necessary.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.160]   If things were obviously bad with Intel over the last couple of years, Apple could have
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:10.480]   gone with AMD as an alternative and stuck with the x86 train and at least made progress.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:17.200]   They made the decision to not do that and go all in on their silicon designs.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.120]   And at least in the near term, it looks like that's probably going to work out for them.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.560]   Based on what we've seen so far, benchmarks of the developer kits, it seems to have great
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.440]   performance, even running stuff in Rosetta.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.040]   Yeah, on a two year old chip designed for the iPad, just give it a little memory, some
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.960]   ports, and suddenly you got a computer.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.440]   Yeah, I mean, what happens three years from now or four years from now?
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.920]   If suddenly they hit a roadblock with their silicon, then what do they do?
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.080]   That's a good question.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.120]   They could end up getting stalled for several years trying to recover from that.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.200]   But you kind of have to work to pull a negative outcome out of the year.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.440]   Well, it could all collapse.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.400]   Well, yeah, but you kind of have to work.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   Admittedly, they're a risk.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.000]   It's nobody's saying they're not a risk.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.400]   But the thing is we've seen it happen in the silicon business.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   It happened to end to that.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.160]   Numerous times over the last 30 to 40 years.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.080]   Yeah, it's happened to Intel more than once with ITATM and more recently with some of
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.080]   their x86 stuff.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   It happened with AMD.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.760]   It's happened with every company at some point in time.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:26.560]   So there's a greater, a far greater than zero probability that it will happen at some
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.280]   point with Apple.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:35.400]   And then if that does happen, then they don't have an alternative to go to at that point.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:41.160]   I think it is a lot more practically, I guess, because the reason that they're doing this,
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.280]   and they haven't said we're never using an Intel processor again or AMD or anybody.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.280]   That's a good point.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.520]   They didn't say that.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:55.040]   No, I think that they'll continue in those high end machines like those Mac Pros and
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.880]   iMac Pros.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.840]   They'll continue to use Intel Xeon or whatever makes sense for them.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.200]   I think for the foreseeable future.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:10.800]   I don't think Apple Silicon has anything to do with them dominating the world.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.280]   I mean, remember their market share in computers is still under 10%.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.920]   People are buying a lot more Chromebooks.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.400]   People are still buying a lot more Windows machines than they're buying Macs.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:27.200]   But they do need to have a place in that ecosystem because that's where a lot of the creators
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.200]   are.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.000]   Those are a lot of the app makers that fuel the other parts of their ecosystem.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:40.400]   And so they need to serve that segment well, but it's not dominating in any sense.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.200]   It is the most valuable part.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.800]   It is the most profitable part of the market.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.920]   I think they want to serve it well, but it's not a world domination scheme.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:56.880]   They have plenty of other challenges in other parts of their businesses that they're having
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.480]   some struggles in.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.960]   Apple TV plus has got serious struggle.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.520]   Yeah, but they don't have to succeed for Apple to succeed.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.720]   That's not a profit center.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.320]   For services for their big bet on services because they've essentially said services
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.320]   is the future of the company.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.720]   If there's any weak point in services, I'd agree with you 100%.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   It is.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.480]   And that's still a pool that's being pulled along by the hardware more than anything else.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.560]   The news is also a struggle.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.800]   Remember, though, as the chat was pointing out, Apple doesn't want to dominate in market
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   share.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.920]   They want to dominate in profit share, which they do.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.920]   Yes, 100%.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.920]   100%.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.240]   And if you're running your company, that's all you need to be 100% of the market.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   It's true.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.040]   And they're executing well on the things that they do, but it's not that I think that it's
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:53.160]   a little overzealous to say that they're pulling away from the competition.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.720]   They have serious competition in a lot of the markets that they're facing.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.080]   Really, every market that they're facing.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.640]   Let me run through this because I agree with you.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.040]   I think it's more complicated, but Neil is very smart.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.560]   Neil Sybar, it's a blog above Avalon.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.960]   Here is, he says, is by no means an all inclusive list, but here's a list of competitors who
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.320]   are struggling a little bit.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.280]   Samsung, he says, remains rudderless from a product vision perspective, no clear direction
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.280]   where to go.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.280]   It's true.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.720]   They're just throwing spaghetti at the wall.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:29.760]   Google, good Lord, Google, they say, he says, continues to prioritize technology over design.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.400]   They're having all sorts of trouble with hardware, but they're also just confused about their,
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.160]   I think, about their mission.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.800]   Amazon's massive bet on voice turns out to be the wrong one.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.320]   The smart speaker space was a mirage because where he believes wearables, we're going to
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:52.200]   take this, not stationary voice input, and he thinks Apple, as many do, is very well
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.720]   positioned in the wearable space.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:02.120]   Microsoft and their surface, they're merely taking share from their OEMs, not from Apple.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.720]   I think Microsoft's heart really isn't in hardware or even operating systems.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.160]   Microsoft wants to be a cloud business.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.800]   They don't care if Apple, it's Apple, or Intel, or anything else.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:19.160]   It's still going to use their cloud, and there's their office in the cloud and all of this.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.760]   Facebook's a competitor when it comes to advertising.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.840]   There's no question, but that's not Apple's business.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:29.120]   In fact, the more Facebook imposes on our privacy, Neil points out, the better it is
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.120]   for Apple.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.600]   A message that he says through Apple's message is a message not sent through Facebook.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.680]   For a lot of consumers, that's a plus.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.640]   Snap, Spotify.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.520]   They seem to have dominated this competitive market space.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.720]   What happened to Intel, though?
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.280]   This was theirs to lose.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.920]   I can't really get into this conversation as you know.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920]   I'm not like a developer.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   I know.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   This is a very geeky conversation.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.440]   But I'm taking it in, and I'm like, wow, there's a lot of things.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.440]   It's interesting, isn't it?
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.360]   But do you think innovation, I feel like, how is Intel innovated?
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.360]   They haven't.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.800]   The last attempted innovation, well, they had two that were flops.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:19.160]   One was, as you mentioned, Sam, I-tanium, which turns out it was unob-un-ob-tanium.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.920]   They couldn't make it work.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.040]   So they went back to x86.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.360]   And then remember, they were trying to do the M scale processors.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.840]   They were desperately trying to get into mobile.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.480]   And another, they couldn't execute.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.400]   So maybe their whole problem is just they can't-
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.840]   They actually had an ARM business at one point, which they sold off.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.160]   The X scale division.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   That's right.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.120]   Well, they sold that off.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.400]   It's never going anywhere there, ARM stuff.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:49.560]   I mean, they certainly have had struggles over the last several years on the process side.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.440]   And there was another article I saw earlier today that an interview was a former Intel
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:01.480]   exec, talking about quality assurance issues that they had, particularly with the Skylake
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.880]   generation of processors.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.640]   So I guess there was a lot of issues with the design of those processors that were getting
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:14.120]   through Intel's process stream inside and getting to customers, particularly Apple.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.360]   Apparently, that's what treated Apple to make the decision to go with their own silicon.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.080]   Apple was stalled waiting for Skylake.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.280]   They were just stalled.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.440]   One interesting new technology that Intel does have that hasn't really gotten a lot of
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.480]   attention yet is something they announced recently.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.160]   I first heard about it about a year and a half ago at an analyst event they did.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.680]   It's called Lakefield, which is their hybrid CPU.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:49.320]   It's a 3D stacked processor, a system on a chip, where they're actually stacking multiple
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   different types of cores vertically on the die.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:59.720]   So you've got a relatively small die and they've got what they call their Foveros technology,
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.440]   which is an interconnect technology.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:07.120]   It's a really high speed, interconnect technology between these different processing elements
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.800]   on this chip so that you can transfer data back and forth between these different processor
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   types.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:20.880]   So you've got things like neural engines and x86 core and some GPU type cores.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.840]   You can mix and match a lot of different things.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.240]   It's something that actually has the potential to do some really interesting stuff with it,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:35.600]   to get some really high performance out of it in different types of applications.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.560]   That's only just coming to market now.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.160]   They just actually announced it a couple of weeks ago, even though this is something
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.600]   they've been working on for quite a few years.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.560]   It's interesting because Intel's innovation has all occurred because they couldn't get
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.040]   clock speeds fast enough on single CPUs, single chips.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   And so they did multi chips.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   They're doing stacking.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.760]   Optane was a stacked memory.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:05.960]   They're trying to eke more performance by increasing the depth and count.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.640]   I wonder if there was something that went wrong in there.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:16.840]   Remember, Intel had innovation struggles for years and they really got bailed out by their
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   team, the small.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:27.600]   Yes, they came up with the dual core, just much more practical, much more, you know,
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.480]   really just innovative and that bailed them out for a while.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.440]   But you know, this split with Apple, even though I don't think it's a permanent split,
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.960]   I don't think it's a hundred percent.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.960]   That's interesting.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.760]   I think you're the only guy I foresee and say that.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.360]   I thought everybody just said, "Oh, yeah."
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.280]   Apple said, "We'll have a few more Intel products coming out."
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   But they...
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.280]   So you think they may not abandon Intel?
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.280]   That's an interesting take on it.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.280]   I don't.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.280]   I don't.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.720]   Just because, look, I think that the Intel thing was inevitable.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.240]   And Apple started making its own chips.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:03.920]   This was inevitable because when Apple has to wait on a partner, like Intel, they had
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.600]   Max, they wanted to launch, they couldn't launch them because Intel was late with their
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.440]   processors as you referred to.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.320]   And also, as you know, Sheer talked about in innovation, Apple just has a team that's
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.720]   they've been out innovating Intel.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.240]   And the Johnny Suruji and his team at Apple has just delivered again and again and again
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.640]   with the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.600]   It's just inevitable that they're like, "Look, we're making these chips.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.160]   There's no reason these couldn't run a computer, especially a laptop.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.560]   I think they will replace every Intel chip on a laptop 100%.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.280]   I think some of these other devices, I wouldn't be surprised if they hedge a little bit and
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.840]   they still, if it makes sense, will run or at least make them compatible.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.120]   You have the choice of having an Apple chip or an Intel chip on some of those.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.320]   Yeah, I hadn't thought about it.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.280]   Sheer, did you wear the Snapchat spectacles?
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   You have those.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.280]   Oh, God.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.280]   No, I mean, I thought it was a joke.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.280]   Really?
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.840]   I mean, it was cute, but then it's just it's not something.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.000]   It's like one of those trends, the fads, and you do it once or like you do it for a month.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   It's not like where the whole time.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.120]   I was going through my Snapchat videos and there was a whole bunch of them from whenever
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.000]   those came out because I kept pressing the button and there was a killer.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Remember this?
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   They had cameras on it.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I brought up a lot of privacy issues.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.240]   Like it was very strange if you were around someone that you didn't trust and they were
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.080]   had them on, you felt like they were just going to be spying on you and just posting
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.080]   all this stuff with you.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:40.080]   So they've released their third version of these.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.640]   They keep trying.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.880]   Did he even go to the first version go well?
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.080]   Like, I don't know why they keep trying.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.760]   This is like the Kango Star version.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.760]   Look at the.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.760]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.880]   It went great for about three or four weeks until they actually had some sufficient supply.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.440]   You remember those pop-up stores?
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.760]   I actually got mine on eBay.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.920]   Somebody went to the pop-up store in New York because you had to time it and you had to
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.320]   know when they were and bought it and I bought it from them.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   But I was proud.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.040]   I only spent like 20% of for this price.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.200]   Because I wanted to see what this was all about.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.160]   The reason I ask is these aren't it.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   Google Glass wasn't it.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.640]   But I think there and Sybar talks a little bit about this too.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:24.400]   There is some credible reason to think we're going to be entering the age of wearables
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.920]   in the next maybe three to five years.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   And the most sensible thing would be a pair of glasses.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.240]   Everybody seems to agree.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.840]   All the rumors are that Apple will actually ship its first pair of glasses in the next
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.320]   couple of years.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:45.680]   And I ask you, Shira, because I thought if anybody would wear these, it would be you.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:51.640]   I like the idea because it does get to be a lot of work when you have to document stuff
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.280]   and you have to keep on putting your phone up.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.160]   And if there was something that was a bit more seamless, that you didn't have to do the
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.800]   work that would help.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:04.440]   But I just don't see it really, I don't see it being normalized.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.880]   Or unless that's just us old school people talking and then the younger people, that's
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:15.240]   just how they would want to have their tech as on them in that way.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   I just don't know.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.560]   I could see it being really great for protests, things like that or content creation or festivals
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.160]   or events.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:29.520]   Or if you're walking or if you're a travel person and you want to document that and you
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.120]   don't want to always have to go to your phone or your camera.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.520]   But then if we're just hanging out, what?
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:42.040]   I was just going to say, certainly things like events, you're just saying, are protests.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.760]   That would be amazing right now with all these protests.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.880]   And a lot of what we're seeing, a lot of what's triggered these protests is people documenting
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.240]   it with their phones.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:58.080]   And if you could make that process more seamless, like you said, reduce that friction, then it
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:05.480]   would potentially put a lot more pressure on anybody that's doing something wrong to stop.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:11.760]   I don't think that's what I mean, I don't think Apple wants to make protests, spectacles.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:17.040]   But you know, if I think about it, if I'm a woman and I'm walking, I get to wear my
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.360]   chemicals as I'm walking or jogging if anything happens.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.920]   But you know, if I'm out on a date, am I going to want to wear those?
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.440]   Hi, hi.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.600]   I'm your Tinder date.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   Yeah, no, I just wear these because I'm worried about you being a creep.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.640]   You don't mind.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.320]   So I'm wearing the first, this is the first generation.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:48.040]   And you know, I think Snap made a point of making this, the camera have a big yellow circle
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.120]   around it.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.480]   Because otherwise you might not see it, which is even more annoying.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.760]   You two ones are probably not going to have it, right?
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.280]   This is one of those like best quality, worst quality things.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.880]   That's something my wife says a lot, right?
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.200]   The person's best quality is also often their worst quality.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   You know?
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.000]   And your wife is sure.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.600]   Wow, I have to think about that.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.880]   I'm going to spend some time thinking about that.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.400]   Because it's like, if your best quality is like you're very driven and you're very ambitious
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.000]   and you're very sort of organized, but that's also probably the thing that you're going
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.440]   to drive some people crazy with too, right?
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   Right.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   Like the person just, they just don't quit.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.440]   They never let up.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.440]   Right.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   Kind of thing, right?
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.440]   But it's true about this too.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:34.280]   The best quality is that you could stealthily record the police when they are doing something
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.320]   they shouldn't.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:42.080]   You could catch people doing things that maybe we're breaking the law or we're doing something
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.680]   unjust.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.640]   But at the same time, if everybody's walking around, then all of a sudden you also lose
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:54.600]   some trust to the point which you should never know who's actually recording you or taking
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   photos of you.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.000]   Then at the same time, that's a little creepy and now you're going to be a lot less trustful
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.920]   of people when you're in the public, which I think is somewhat inevitable in the world
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.000]   that we live in.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.080]   But that's part of sort of the best quality, the best thing about them is you could take
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.360]   video and nobody's watching.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.760]   The worst thing is you could take video and nobody knows you are.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.800]   Yeah, the issue is not a lot of people are, as many people are using Snapchat, I mean,
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   younger people are.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   Right.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.240]   Well, I think with this, if people start using this more, would they start using Snapchat
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.760]   more or if they were smart, would they integrate it in some way where you can post it to your
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.320]   Snapchat and then post it everywhere else as well at the same time?
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:40.360]   I feel like I read somewhere that the rumor is that Apple's first glasses would not have
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.440]   a camera per se.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.920]   They would have infrared sensing, LiDAR style 3D sensing.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:53.360]   But really the point of the glasses is not as these snap glasses were to record the world
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.200]   around you, not just like a camera phone that's always on your face, but really as a more
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.800]   informational heads up display.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.640]   There's a company that makes such a thing called North.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.120]   We did a review.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.200]   How long ago was Anthony's review of the Fokles?
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.920]   It might have been as long as almost a year ago, the Fokles 1.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.280]   North has been working on Fokles 2.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.280]   It was just announced this week.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.480]   Google bought them.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:22.000]   I think what's shaping up is a little bit of a Silicon Valley battle over the next generation
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.640]   of computing platforms.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.560]   I do think they'll be wearables.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.000]   I don't think they'll be wearables by themselves.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.560]   I think they'll be connected to your smartphone.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.600]   The lot of the computing power will be on the smartphone.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.360]   I think that you'll be able to...
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.280]   What are AirPods, especially AirPods Pro, but a smart device in your ear?
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:51.640]   I was going to say, I feel like Apple, if they did it, they have the best possibility to win.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.480]   If you think about it, you're listening to stuff.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.920]   I think it would be really cool if you had your glasses and you look down if you had
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:04.560]   a food or ingredients and you could see it's connected to your phone and then you could
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:10.560]   see how many calories are going to go back to you or the temperature check outside.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.680]   You would just look outside and it says what the temperature is.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.480]   Or you're on a Zoom call and it says he's wore that shirt the last 32 calls you had with
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.480]   him.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   That would be good.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   You would like to notice that.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.360]   But a lot of what you just described sure depends on having a camera to be able to see
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.040]   and classify the environment around you.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.800]   That seems like it runs totally counter to...
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.040]   Well, we both want privacy.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.360]   Just as Jason said, we want it and we don't want it.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   So can you really...
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:45.080]   So you do something that lives up to what Apple talks about with privacy and actually make
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   it useful.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.320]   That's the challenge.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.720]   What Apple's going to try to sell you on if they do this is we will...
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.520]   It will be on device.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.520]   It will be encrypted.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.360]   We don't have any look at it.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.520]   Trust us because we're not...
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.520]   We don't sell your data for a living, right?
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.280]   Because from what we...
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.720]   From our reporting, we have a number of people that do this.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.560]   Our reporting is that Apple and Facebook are the ones that are the farthest ahead on this,
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.760]   the next generation smart glasses.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.880]   Who are you going to trust with that?
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   Smart Facebook or Apple?
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.360]   Sure, it's all not Facebook.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   Exactly.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.160]   And then Google knows that they're a little behind.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.440]   That's why they bought it.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.120]   They've got to catch up to Apple and Facebook.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:35.400]   Amazon wants to be there too, but they're still sort of finding their way in hardware.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:41.000]   But Amazon, Google, Facebook, they all make money off your data, right?
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.040]   Apple's going to try to make the arguments that they don't.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:50.720]   I'd say the thing to watch as to how close we are is if Apple is fall, if they announce
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.000]   that they're getting in the camera business, like they're going to do a smart doorbell
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.840]   or a smart camera and they're going to sell this in the same way, right?
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.520]   They're going to say, "Trust us because it's all on device.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.680]   We don't sell your data.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.680]   We don't want your data.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.920]   We don't even know what your data is.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.080]   It's all encrypted."
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.080]   If they start to do that this fall, then know that they're probably getting pretty close
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.720]   with glasses too, right?
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.600]   That they're already sort of priming the pump.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.720]   If they get in the camera business, which is one of the things that's sort of one of
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.840]   the open questions, do they want to do this?
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:24.440]   Because they haven't been very happy with how well smart home companies are working
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:30.560]   with their ecosystem in a home kit enabled devices.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.880]   So they might make their own.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.760]   But they obviously, we ran a report last year that some sources that we have that we know
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.200]   that they are working on this.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.400]   They have a group.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.560]   There have been mixed reports on that.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.800]   This is something that's happening for sure.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:53.320]   I think there are going to be some really interesting things that happen because of it.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:57.200]   I think we have to expect this idea of the government is already wanting to bear down
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:04.560]   on big tech and stuff like this is definitely a trigger moment for something for I think
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.320]   a lot of governments, especially the EU.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.520]   But also the US government is looking so much closer at big tech.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.320]   I want to take a little break, but I do want to come back to this conversation because
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.080]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:20.160]   A couple of weeks ago, Mark Gurman, who is very well connected rumor guy at Bloomberg,
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:26.560]   had some interesting, very concrete rumors about Apple's AR glasses and their plans.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.280]   I hope they don't look like the ones I'm wearing right now.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.560]   This was from a time, a different time, wasn't it?
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.120]   When Snap could do these spectacles.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.720]   It was like, it was a more innocent time.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.280]   They're looking full.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.120]   You're just, are you going to wear them the whole show?
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.560]   Yeah, I think I'm going to wear them now.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   What do you think?
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.560]   Should I sure?
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.560]   I mean, you look kind of cool.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.560]   It's very risky business.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.560]   It is.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.560]   A modern day risky.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.840]   I'm not wearing any pants either.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.280]   And I've got white socks on.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.560]   So I'm just saying, I'm just saying.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.160]   I've got Tom Cruise on my mind.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.440]   Our show, sure Lazar is here from pizza inside.me.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.600]   No, peace inside.live.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:10.720]   I'm not going to start a competing podcast all about eating pizza for breakfast.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   I promise.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   Hey, do what you got to do.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.640]   Tell us about peace inside that live.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.760]   So platform around mindfulness, meditation and movement and we offer donation based live
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.520]   zoom sessions with facilitators around the world, workshops on the weekend, community
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.200]   discussions with leaders in the space as well.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.880]   Seven days a week, you do this.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   You work hard.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.240]   Yeah, making all this more accessible to people and taking down the barriers for entry around
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.120]   to this space because more and more as we're seeing working from home with all this uncertainty,
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.960]   how do you find peace inside, literally and figuratively.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.440]   So needed.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.600]   And we're also working with brands and corporations.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.720]   If you have a company that is looking to bring this to your employees or teams during this
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:57.960]   time or your consumers, we create custom virtual sessions for meetings as well as retreats.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.400]   I love how entrepreneurial you are, Shira.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.560]   Seriously, you always have something you're working on.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.960]   I joke around like, you know, there's some people that constantly work like at companies
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.040]   go from one big company to the other.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.600]   And I just like create ideas constantly.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.520]   You build the company around you.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.520]   It's so smart.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.080]   No, I think I admire that so much.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.840]   I just really admire your energy.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.440]   And the fact that as soon as a quarantine happened, you immediately got ideas, sir.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.240]   Oh, I know what we need to do next.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.240]   I think that's great.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.240]   I really started this two and a half months ago.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.320]   So we had over 2,000 people through our live sessions.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.540]   And now we're just figuring out the next stage as we all look at the future of work and
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.520]   self care and mental health and all that.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.520]   I do.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.160]   We'll talk a little more about that too, because I think we're seeing already the evolution
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.080]   of work, of shopping, of everything.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.240]   This is not going to stop when quarantine stops.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.120]   There's going to be some changes made.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.120]   There's going to be.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.720]   Also with us, it's great to have Sam.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.080]   We'll say, we're going to talk a lot about, we started talking about chips, but cars are
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.080]   getting smarter.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.280]   And I want to talk about you.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.480]   You talked a little bit about the new Ford F-150 last week on the radio show.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.840]   I want to talk a little bit more about the technology that's getting into cars these
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.840]   days is mind boggling.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   Sure.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   It's always welcome.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.120]   There's a lot of amazing tech.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:27.520]   And the thing is, most people really think it's a modern, a very recent thing, because
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.960]   they associate it all with Tesla.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.000]   But we've been putting computers in cars since the 1970s.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.080]   They're just getting a lot smarter.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.320]   And they're getting off the Canbus, I hope.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.440]   They're going to Ethernet and other networking technologies.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.200]   Also with us, the man who got me elected president, I hear that Kanye's looking to get
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.400]   you on his team.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.960]   Jason Hunter, I'm president of the Internet.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:54.960]   Let's put that.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.000]   By the way, that was the last election.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.360]   So I guess it's for life.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.440]   Yeah, it was for life.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.440]   No way.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   All good.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.440]   All good.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.440]   Leadership's are.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.640]   And unlike most leaderships, it has no power, no influence.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.440]   Nobody even knows that I'm president of the Internet.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.440]   But I am.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.440]   So thank you.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   On the DL.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.440]   On the DL.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.280]   That was like 2008 or something.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.160]   That was such a good year, 2008.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.840]   I'm telling you about 2007.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.440]   I for sure had thrown that into my rundown.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.440]   That's right.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.440]   Leo got elected to the president.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.440]   I also had the most Twitter followers in 2007.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.440]   5,000.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   Wow.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.440]   Remember that?
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.440]   I remember the battle between you and Kevin Rose for a while.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.440]   Okay.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.440]   You know what?
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.440]   I mean, I don't know if you're a magic wand, whatever it is.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.440]   And let's go back.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   2007.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   Oh, God.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.960]   That's when Twit really started taking off.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.440]   I mean, I want to go back.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.440]   Let's go back.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.200]   All of us were dating each other and hooking up before everyone got married and had kids.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.000]   I kind of missed that part.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.960]   Well, you weren't part of that.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.200]   Were we dating and hooking up?
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.120]   I must have missed that part.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:05.840]   It was a lot of like, yeah, it was like a crazy time of just people partying.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.680]   The Kevin Rose's and Pete Cashmore.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   That's right.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   Pete Cashmore.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:16.200]   And he's in single and partying together like Internet Week New York and in us.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.600]   Yeah, it was a part.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.400]   Pete, whatever Pete was so good looking man.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.560]   Yeah, he was a good looking guy.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.600]   He had a mashable.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.280]   He had model good looks and a Scottish brogue to go with it.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.760]   And he was very smart, obviously.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.760]   Smart and shut.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   And we look at the show.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   Painfully shy.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.760]   What is Peter?
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.920]   Would you, your assignment?
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.520]   Should you choose to accept it?
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.840]   Sheer as are.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.680]   What the hell is Pete Cashmore doing?
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   Wait, follow back.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.280]   Wait, I wasn't following him.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   He was following me.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.920]   Oh, he's a count just private.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.000]   Oh, so now you have to ask gift to beg.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I just asked.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   I have no shame.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Oh, he'll say yes.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.720]   Oh, he'll say yes.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:57.400]   And then Alexis O'Hanean now he's like, oh my God.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.000]   Alexis, can we talk about that?
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.600]   Come on, show on what's trending.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.240]   And he's now bulked up.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.240]   He is like a man.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.240]   Oh, hold it.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.240]   Hold it.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240]   Hold it.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.520]   The manliness of Alexis O'Hanean in just a bit.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.600]   But first, a word from our sponsor.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   That's a tease.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.640]   Now, you know, the only problem with doing good teases on podcasts, people just fast
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.920]   forward through the ad.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.280]   It's not like live radio share.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.720]   You see on your live show, on your radio show that you do.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.720]   First over, Alexis O'Hanean.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.960]   You know, he is married.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.680]   Yeah, I know he's married.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.680]   He's very married.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.800]   To see you know, you can kick your ass.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.800]   He married up.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   He married up.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   Shh.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.000]   Don't mess with Alexis.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Marina, come over to your house.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.680]   She's tough.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.960]   Anyway, let's talk some more about that in a bit.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.480]   Our show today brought to you by the last pass.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.440]   You know, we're in the last pass studio.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.880]   Thank God.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.440]   The last bastion, the quarantined last pass studio.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.720]   I'm the only one who can use this is my studio now, baby.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.520]   I'm the captain of the last pass studio now.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.400]   Last pass is something we started using years ago back in probably 2007.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.720]   I'm probably very close to that actually.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.440]   I've been using it for more than 10 years.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.600]   So yeah, it was my, you know, password manager of choice for years, then started using the
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.800]   business version of Twid.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.240]   And now I'm glad, you know, as we send everybody home, this is tough.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.640]   Your IT department has a very big job.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.720]   There's more devices.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.480]   There's more applications.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.600]   And your workforce is remote.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:36.800]   That means all new threats, regulations, strong security has gotten very complex, but last
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.240]   pass is there to help your IT department with strong security that your employees will
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.800]   love because it's easy to use, easy to use and easy to manage, which is normally a kind
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.520]   of a contradiction.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:52.280]   Last pass makes you secure at every entry point from shadow IT to apps to mobile and
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.680]   cloud services.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.120]   Their access solutions give you visibility and control over every access point to your
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.120]   organization.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.160]   Really, if you think about it, you set your employees home with the keys to the kingdom.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.840]   They have your bank accounts.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.000]   They have your website.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.280]   They have logins to your databases, your customer records.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.200]   They got it all.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.640]   So you got to make sure they can stay secure.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.520]   Last pass unifies access and authentication.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.360]   There's single sign on, for instance, is so, so cool.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.120]   Employees love it because no more passwords.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.240]   They just say yes on their phone.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.040]   They're in, but your IT department also loves it because you get a simple and integrative
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.320]   view across all access and authentication tests.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:33.080]   They know who is accessing, when and where.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.160]   You can also increase security without impacting productivity.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.760]   I know you want that.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.720]   Don't slow down your employees.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.680]   And it kind of goes hand in hand with making them happy.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.680]   They love it.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:43.920]   Don't leave your business exposed.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.120]   Make your employees happy.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.680]   Make password security effortless.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.640]   It's not just passwords, but it also still were stuck.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.240]   Most of the sites, most of the places, most of the apps.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.680]   These days still use passwords and they're the entryways into businesses.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   That's your weak link.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.680]   So make sure you secure it.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.000]   No more sticky notes.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.040]   They also make it easy to share.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.320]   Employees can share passwords easily, securely.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.960]   256-bit AES encryption.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.680]   The best you can get.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:17.240]   It is never, your passwords are never, never available, unencrypted anywhere, but on your
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.120]   device.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.840]   Last pass does not have access to the password.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.640]   The password's never sent.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.440]   It's just yours.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.040]   And I think that's so important.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.280]   I consider it my secure enclave on every device.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.120]   iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux, every browser.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.000]   That's where I put my most important information.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.920]   Notes, my SSH logins, things like that.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.000]   Secure your business.

[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.960]   So if you've been doing, while I've been talking, Shira has been looking up Alexa,
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.920]   so Hanyan, Basha, following his Instagram.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.920]   Did he approve you?
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   Did he accept you yet?
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   Oh, what?
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.920]   Pete Cashmore?
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   Cashmore, man.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.520]   I wonder if Pete will accept me while I'm on the show and then we could really dive in.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   We could really celebrate.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.440]   I've known Alexa for years and I do follow him on social media.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.440]   Somebody calling you?
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.440]   Is that Pete?
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.440]   Is Pete calling you?
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.440]   Did he come over?
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.440]   Did he say?
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.440]   Oh, hi Shira.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.320]   I'm a way thing for you to follow me.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.120]   Yes, he's calling me from across the country.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.160]   But yeah, so let's go back to Alexis because I've known him and that guy has made talk
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.240]   about a transformation.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.080]   So he's founded and I've interviewed him.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.160]   I know him too, not as well as you do, but I've interviewed him a couple of times.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.360]   He founded Reddit.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.600]   He and Steve Huffman, Huffman's still at Reddit as CEO.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.120]   Alexis has kind of left Reddit.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:55.880]   In fact, most recently during the Black Lives Matter protests, he said, "I'm giving up my
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.280]   board seat on one condition.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.680]   You replace it with a Black board member."
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.680]   And they did.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.720]   In fact, a really good new board member.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.280]   So Alexis is pretty hip.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.160]   He's pretty with it.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.320]   He's done very well for himself.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.560]   And then he married Serena.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.560]   Yep.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.560]   He did well.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.800]   I know because I see him like you watch the tennis matches.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.360]   And you know how they show the tennis player playing and then they'll show the spouse in
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.360]   the stands.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.880]   They're Alexis sitting in the stands going.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   It's amazing.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.360]   It's like for those of us who do him as a geeky guy, it's amazing.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.720]   All right.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.200]   So anything else to say he's buffed up?
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.680]   No, I mean, he's looking hot.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:44.320]   I mean, I must say he, you know, I think men age well, but then also you add in like working
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.400]   out and then making money and doing good for the world.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   So good luck.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.240]   He's doing he is doing good for the world.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.000]   Here's a here's a picture of him and Serena.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:59.440]   He still looks you know what he honestly in this picture Serena looks cool, calm, collected.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.440]   He looks like I can't believe it.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   Oh God.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   I can't believe it.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.440]   I'm here.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.440]   Oh my God.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.440]   I'm standing next to Serena Williams.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   I'm so excited.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.440]   Doesn't he?
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.640]   He goes to the Vanity Fair party.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.640]   Oh, I know.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   He's yeah.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.640]   He's made it.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.600]   Allas in New York was all those big fancy gals.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.600]   He actually according to business insider once stood up in class to tell his friends
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.520]   he hated tennis.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.520]   Aw.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.280]   Times of searching.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.240]   Well, you can hate the game and then not hate the players.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.520]   I've heard that.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.640]   I think he's supposed to hate the game, not the player, but I don't know anyway.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   Or hate the play and not the game.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.640]   I don't remember.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.720]   No, hate the game, not the player.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.240]   Hate the game, not the player.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.240]   Very nicely done, Sam.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:50.760]   23 time grand slam tennis champion Serena Williams.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.400]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.400]   It's pretty, pretty awesome.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.840]   He thought tennis was a joke of a sport.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.280]   He would even change the channel if it was on.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.240]   Who are pointed about this?
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.320]   How did they find out?
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.720]   People are entitled to change their minds too, right?
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:10.280]   Like we've all changed our minds about a lot of things since we were in the fourth or
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.440]   in the, you know, 10th graders or something.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:21.120]   CBS News has a series called Note to Self in which he reads like, I guess people read
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:27.200]   their, you know, like childhood notes or journal or something like that.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.480]   He did a class assignment in fourth grade in which he said I hate that.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.320]   How do we get on this?
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.320]   I forgot.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.320]   It stopped.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.320]   We're stopping right now.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.320]   I don't even know.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.320]   We were talking about Pete Cashmore.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.320]   Pete Cashmore.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   He says in seven.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.320]   We're back.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   This is when you have Pete on the show.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   No, you're great.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.320]   We all get a little distracted.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   Distracted.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:53:01.200]   So we were talking about some sort of augmented reality thing.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:07.920]   And I think that Mark Gurman had the big scoop on that, the AR glasses in Bloomberg.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.320]   I mean, I'm going to see if I can find that.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.160]   Don't you think of when you think of glasses like the Black Mirror episode where you can
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.120]   get people to be there like Instagram and following and everything?
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.320]   Yes.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:27.280]   And then if social score goes down, your life is ruined by even one point.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.080]   So this scoop came out a couple of weeks ago.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:35.000]   Gurman's well connected, often considered to be, you know, when he says something's
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.520]   considered to be pretty accurate.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.640]   They've been, Apple's been building a team since late 2015.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:48.200]   Now a thousand engineers working on two products aimed according to Gurman at upending the
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.400]   VR and AR segments.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:57.440]   There's a device codename N301 that would be an all encompassing digital experience for
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:01.080]   gaming and consuming content.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:06.600]   And then the real device, and that's presumably coming out next year.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:15.480]   The real device, though, be the N421, a lightweight pair of glasses that he expects.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:20.880]   Let me see in a few years, like 2022.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.920]   And those would be completely augmented reality.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.600]   You think that's going to be the next battleground?
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.840]   You know, one thing we learned from Apple's Silicon announcement is that they had been
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:32.440]   putting the pieces of this together in ways that didn't immediately become clear.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:36.720]   And then as soon as they said it, it was like, oh, that's why, for instance, the iPad Pro
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.800]   is so overpowered.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.800]   You had to have this superpower chip.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.320]   Oh, I get it.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:49.640]   Oh, that's why you redesigned, you know, the way the iPhone worked so that it would be.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.640]   That's, I mean, all of this stuff came together.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.880]   That's why you're focused on service, all this stuff.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.720]   I think you might, you can also say that we can see the pieces of the puzzle starting
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.720]   to come together.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.480]   I don't want to be caught out this time.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.040]   So I'm looking ahead.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:08.000]   And for instance, the LiDAR camera on the new iPad Pro, it's the only new feature on
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.320]   the iPad Pro from one year to the next is this LiDAR camera.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:14.640]   It's not that, you know, it's, you hold it up in the thing.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.200]   And then at WWDC, they talk a lot about their new AR kit.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.600]   And it's starting to look like maybe they weren't doing this.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.040]   It's for developers to build apps, right?
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.840]   So they, now they've got hardware in the hands of people.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:31.400]   They've got the software, the developer can teach them how to do it.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   Right.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.360]   And so, you know, because all of the, you know, those things, Google Glass failed because
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.080]   there wasn't enough cool stuff to do with it.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:43.520]   Snapchat, snap glasses failed because there was really only one thing to do with it, right?
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:49.760]   And so for this to succeed, it needs to have some really killer apps that are going to
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.000]   make people or really ultimately needs to have one killer app.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.520]   And the thing is, is you don't know what that one is.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.520]   You know what it is.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.520]   Yes.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.520]   Apple smart enough.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.360]   They can't do it all by themselves.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:08.600]   So there was this video and we talked a little bit about this on Macbreak Weekly AR kit 4,
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:13.040]   which is the next AR kit that Apple showed off this week at WWDC.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.120]   Of course, this is a developer.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.800]   So there's things, there's lots of code.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.280]   But there are some examples in here.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:27.680]   Street view, you know, the ability to map space, geomocene geometry with this was, this
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:31.440]   was an interesting image, I'm going to get back to that, which was a heat map kind of
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.440]   looking picture.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:37.960]   But really, instead of measuring thermals, it's depth, depth sensing.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.040]   So the red is the farthest.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.960]   The blue light blue is the closest.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:45.880]   And so they're learning not just the 3D geometry.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.760]   They're really learning a lot about the depth of this.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:55.760]   And this is powered by what the LIDAR scanner on the iPad Pro.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.760]   And does that come from automotive technologies?
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.080]   Certainly it's part of self-driving, right?
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:07.760]   Yeah, it's, I mean, originally was created before self-driving, but it's really automated
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:12.400]   driving development that has made LIDAR take off as a technology.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:18.120]   And it's like, you know, there's like 70 some startups, you know, over the last decade that
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:21.800]   have popped up, you know, developing various kinds of LIDAR.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:27.040]   But you know, the key to it is with LIDAR, you can do something you can't really do with
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.800]   cameras, which is that depth measurement, you know, actually measuring the distance to
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.280]   those objects.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:38.960]   You can estimate it from a 2D image, but it's just, it's never going to be as accurate as
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.240]   you can get with 3D.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.800]   And that's why, you know, when they added the LIDAR to the iPad, now all of a sudden you
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:49.240]   have much more robust capability to place objects, you know, to know where surfaces
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:54.200]   are in that field of view and place objects in that field of view relative to those surfaces
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   and anchor them.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:00.560]   Can you give us the one minute LIDAR technology, because there's terms like time of flight?
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.760]   Is it like radar?
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.760]   What is it doing?
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:08.120]   Yeah, I mean, it works a similar principle to radar.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.640]   Radar uses radio waves.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.800]   LIDAR uses light waves, a laser beam.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:18.400]   And basically what most LIDARs do and the type that's used by Apple on the iPad, it
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:23.800]   sends out laser pulses, light pulses that are reflected back off of objects and, you
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:28.520]   know, knowing the speed of light, you know, each one of those pulses is encoded with a
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.360]   time stamp basically.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:34.560]   And when it reflects back, you can measure how long it took and you can figure out exactly
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.520]   the distance to that object.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:41.000]   And then there's also another type that's called frequency modulate continuous wave
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.920]   LIDAR, which uses Doppler effect on that.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   Oh, interesting.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:49.200]   That's actually the way most radar works is using that Doppler effect.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:53.000]   That makes more sense if you're moving with regard to the object you're bouncing the thing
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   off of, right?
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:00.720]   Yeah, the advantage that has is you know, every return you get, you can measure an instantaneous
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.480]   velocity of that object.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:08.400]   Whereas with time of flight, you can measure the speed to that object, but then rather
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.560]   you can measure the distance.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:15.960]   And on subsequent pulses, by looking at where that object has moved, you can then calculate
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.680]   the speed from that.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.320]   But it takes you a little bit longer.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.200]   There's a little bit of lag in that.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.040]   And it's not quite as accurate.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:29.000]   So that's, you know, some companies are doing that continuous wave frequency modulated LIDAR
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   now.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.560]   So in the early days of LIDAR, some of the issue, the big issue was the expense.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.960]   I remember there were LIDAR units that cars were using.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.360]   There were $11,000 per unit.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:45.040]   The early ones, those first validines that you saw on the DARPA Grant Challenge cars and
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:51.440]   the early Google cars, those were about $80,000 each.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.440]   Wow.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.960]   And now they're getting down.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:59.040]   You can buy, you know, there's a bunch of different LIDAR sensors that you can buy now
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:04.160]   for anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000 for a 360 degree LIDAR.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.560]   It's still expensive though, right?
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.120]   And also, you know, solid state ones that are getting down to the sub $1,000 level.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.680]   And in the next couple of years, you'll get down close to $100 on the sell.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.840]   And you know, Apple's, is it really LIDAR on the iPad?
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.000]   I mean, are they just using that?
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Yeah, it's LIDAR.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   So it's got to cost less than $100.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.080]   Because the iPad itself is only, you know, $900.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.080]   Right.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.800]   And, you know, it looks like what they're doing is a very basic solid state LIDAR.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.280]   It's a low power, probably 905 nanometer laser.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.680]   It's just silicon.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.160]   There's no moving parts to it.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:44.760]   It's what we call a flash LIDAR, where, you know, it flashes the scene, you know, with
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.080]   a scan of dots and gets the returns off of those.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.080]   It's not scant.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.080]   There's no beam steering.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.000]   You know, it's very, it's fixed, very low short range, probably, you know, no more than
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.160]   five to seven meters.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.680]   So it's same as the face ID camera in Apple's phones.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.080]   It's, yeah, it's a similar, similar concept.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:09.600]   And I would guess it's probably based on the same technology as what they're doing.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:15.320]   I'm not sure exactly what frequency they're using on face ID, but it's that one might
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.080]   actually be a different, that might be a higher frequency.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.680]   That might be a 1550 nanometer.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.960]   Because the thing about 905 nanometer, there's two basic frequencies of LIDAR that are used.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.760]   There's 905 and 1550.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.640]   905 is not eye safe.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:36.600]   So if you have a strong enough beam and get right in somebody's eyes, it could cause eye
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   damage.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.600]   Yikes.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600]   That's good.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.860]   1550 nanometer will not cause eye damage so they can use more powerful lasers and get
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:44.320]   longer range.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:50.260]   So it's actually, it's probably a very low power 905 nanometer that they're using for
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:57.400]   face ID and for the iPad LIDAR, just because if it's the power is low enough, it's not
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.560]   going to cause any damage.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.160]   So the fact that this appeared in the iPad Pro, the most recent release, tells you two
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.160]   things.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.720]   One, as you said, Apple is trying to get developers to try this, to use it, to start
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.200]   writing stuff around it, to give them the capability.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.400]   So they're pushing AR, kit 4 and all that.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.360]   But the other one is it's a manufacturing thing.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.640]   The more that this is what happened with the iPhone in 2007, they released it.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.760]   And suddenly, China, they started making custom machines.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.000]   Apple did for the Chinese manufacturers.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.320]   They started really building this expertise.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.280]   And the prices of the components dropped and dropped and dropped.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.280]   The interesting side benefit is there are all these industries that popped up.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.520]   I think Shiras started her own company all around.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520]   I don't know.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   I'm just joking.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.920]   But I'm wondering how people use this like regular people.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   Drones.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.520]   Well, if you use a drone, for instance, the technology that the iPhone made cheap and
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.480]   widely available in Chinese factories made drones, quadcopters possible.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:02.360]   And I think what Apple's trying to do with LiDAR is build that manufacturing base so
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.400]   that they can make these cheaper and cheaper, better and better over time.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.800]   You agree, Sam, is that what happens?
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.000]   Yeah, I think that's absolutely part of it.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.120]   And I would not be at all surprised if what they're incorporating for the LiDAR and the
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:24.080]   iPad and probably in some upcoming devices has evolved directly out of the work that
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.080]   Apple's been doing on their automated driving program.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.520]   I have no doubt that they've been developing their own sensors.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.000]   The vehicles that are out on the road.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.440]   You think that maybe the Apple car rumor was really just misguided because they were
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.840]   making a LiDAR and people thought it must be for a car?
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.760]   I think that they actually were developing their own automated driving system.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:48.440]   I don't think that they were ever all that serious about developing a complete vehicle.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.040]   I think they were focused on the automated driving part because I think that's probably
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.040]   where they think the real money is.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.040]   Because building cars is a little margin business.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.960]   But if you build an automated driving system and a service around that, now all of a sudden
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.360]   you have the potential for some money if you can get it to work.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:12.280]   And I think given that that has taken a lot longer to get to maturity, they probably took
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:17.760]   some of the ideas developed out of that program, brought them into other parts of the company,
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.520]   into these mobile devices to use.
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:26.840]   And when it first came out that they were working on automated driving, my first thought was,
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:33.600]   "Okay, well, they bought PrimeSense, the company developed the original Microsoft Connect.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.320]   They're doing their own silicon.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.400]   They're doing all kinds of things as software.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:44.480]   It makes sense for them to develop all of this full stack, the hardware and the software
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.160]   in-house running on their own compute platform.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:52.600]   And if they can get that to work, it gives them a real potential advantage over some of
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.920]   the competitors.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.840]   But there's that big if you can get it to work, which so far has been a real challenge
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.840]   for everybody."
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.720]   That's going to be the real, you can say, "Apple Silicon is a risky move."
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.720]   That's less risky.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.480]   They've been making Apple Silicon since 2007.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.440]   They kind of understand the business.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.600]   The real risky move and the move that you have to do because you've got to find a successor
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.440]   to the iPhone is this move into wearables.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.600]   I don't think they're doing cars, but they're moving to wearables.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.560]   I'm sorry, I cut you off.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.600]   You want to say something, Jason?
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:27.880]   I was just going to say there's another end game here.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.840]   One of the end games is making glasses that are going to be one of the next great consumer
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.840]   devices.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.280]   They need the next iPhone.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.280]   Right.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.280]   There are challenges with that.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.600]   But also, remember, one of the things that a lot of people overlooked with Google was
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:49.840]   like how important maps were mapping the world for the digital, the next phase of the digital
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.360]   revolution was critically important.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.760]   It's the same with LiDAR.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:05.920]   LiDAR putting LiDAR in the hands of people to map the world for them, although they could
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:14.000]   do similar to what we've seen with maps and essentially people in these vehicles out to
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.760]   do it, but they needed on a more detailed level.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:28.560]   Whoever gets this technology and puts it in the hands of their users and they map the
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:35.720]   world for us in LiDAR, that is going to be absolutely critical to, just to name two things,
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.760]   the autonomous vehicles and robots and automation.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:46.760]   Because when you have the world mapped to that sort of 3D model level, then all of a
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:55.040]   sudden you have this incredibly valuable data set that's probably more valuable than sitting
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:01.160]   on top of oil, because so many people are going to want to build businesses off of that
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.120]   data, that mapping data from LiDAR.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.480]   And so that's another way to be end games too, right?
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:15.240]   It is because Apple doesn't typically get into that business, but you can bet Google
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:22.800]   Facebook, Amazon, others, absolutely Microsoft, absolutely want a piece of that.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.840]   What about VR experiences?
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.520]   Because I was thinking like with this whole quarantine thing and people being stuck inside
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:38.160]   in tourism, would this be able to be used to drop people into different cities or even
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.160]   tourist destinations?
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.800]   I feel like this could be huge.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:47.200]   I mean, and actually that's a conversation I want to have next, which is how the stuff
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   we're doing today with mixed success, globally COVID-19 related like quarantining, how it's
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.440]   going to definitely, I think very much changed the landscape in a way that it's going to
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.600]   hasten some stuff along, it's going to kill some stuff that wouldn't have happened if
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.120]   it weren't for that.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.880]   Here's by the way, another interesting use of LiDAR.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:15.200]   It is being used, we had them on the new screensavers a couple of years ago, it is being used
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.720]   to map ancient ruins.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:28.280]   This is a Mayan city that is invisible, but LiDAR can actually take the forest canopy out
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:32.400]   and reveal the layout of the city below it.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:38.280]   They're doing a lot of this now in the Amazon forest and other places, starting to see stuff
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.360]   that we couldn't see before thanks to LiDAR.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.360]   It's a really interesting thing.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:47.560]   Yeah, and that's the sort of thing you can do with the frequency modulate, continuous
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:54.440]   wave LiDAR, the higher power, and much higher resolution than anything we're using for cars
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.080]   or iPads.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:04.280]   You can go through and do that sort of thing, take fly a drone or aircraft over it, map
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:11.600]   that, and then you can actually filter out things like the trees, filter out all of a
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:18.680]   lot of things by comparing frame by frame and seeing where everything is and you can actually
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.640]   remove a lot of things and there's a lot of potential.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:27.840]   Because one of the challenges LiDAR has had is when you have a reflection off of a snowflake
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:36.280]   or a raindrop with some of that early generation LiDAR, it couldn't see through rain basically
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.280]   or far.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.280]   That's so useful.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:43.480]   But now some of these newer generations of LiDAR actually can filter that stuff out fairly
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480]   reliably.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.200]   The comment too about sort of the effects of some of these things on where we're at and
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:58.640]   where we go from here reminds me of a tweet that somebody that I followed on Twitter
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.320]   and I recently interviewed Ruho Benjamin, who I believe has been on Twitch, I think you've
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.320]   interviewed her on Twitch.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.400]   She wrote the book Race After Technology.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:15.280]   Which is really a tremendously in depth and amazing look at the alternate narrative of
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:23.600]   technology, especially on people of color and how it has reinforced and worsened many
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:33.160]   of the challenges that we have in terms of race, in terms of social justice.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:42.520]   So she's amazing but she had a talk, she tweeted about this, there was a talk that she was
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.360]   going to be doing and they said, "Oh and by the way, we're working on possibly doing
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.080]   it as a hologram."
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.640]   Wow.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.880]   Which was amazing.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880]   Wow.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.320]   That's where we're at, right?
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:58.840]   All of a sudden there are a lot of events that are not going to happen.
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:05.680]   The CES is obviously a big question mark, but as we look into next year, Broadway just
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.120]   announced they're essentially shut down through next March.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.280]   We have a lot of kinds of things we might do, might have normally done that we're not
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.360]   going to be doing and so we're having to think of different ways and this is going to, I
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.760]   think is a point that you all sort of mentioned, we're likely going to accelerate some trends
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:32.440]   that were already happening, this COVID-19 pandemic is likely to accelerate in virtual
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:38.240]   meetings in all kinds of things in terms of events, in terms of shopping, in terms of
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.280]   education last week.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:48.720]   So I interviewed Ruha recently and that video is up but talking about her book and her narrative,
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:55.040]   this alternate narrative on technology, but I also just interviewed last week, Sal Khan
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.720]   from Khan Academy about what does all of this mean for education and where that team
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:07.160]   is doing a lot of that and so, yeah, there's a lot of things in motion right now and a
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.240]   lot of things that are accelerating and we're trying to deal with the acceleration.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.240]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:19.280]   Everything is changing.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:27.360]   We were just waxing the nostalgic about 2007, even in the 13 years since then, the train
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:34.760]   where Rydin's gotten faster and faster and faster and it is a weird experience, I mean,
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:39.600]   we cover technology so we're in the people strapped to the front of the train watching
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.960]   stuff come at us fast.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.120]   I don't know about you, but I feel like it's accelerating.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.760]   It is, I know it's accelerating and it's getting harder and harder to hold on to.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:57.560]   The idea is coming, there's another one, there's another one and it kind of, for me,
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:04.360]   it helps me understand a little bit why there is definitely a trend in this country and
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.480]   it's a trend certainly that the president has kind of tapped into.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.320]   When is going too fast?
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:17.120]   I mean, mine nostalgia for 2007 is nothing to bear these people.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.400]   Can we go back to before the Civil War?
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.320]   Because it's, and of course, those are imaginary times that nostalgia for those times eliminates
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.360]   all the negatives and only highlights the golden glow.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.720]   It's like watching gone with the wind.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.720]   What a wonderful time that was.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:38.640]   But I think that that's kind of what's going on in this country and it's accelerating as
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.240]   technology and life starts to get faster and faster.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:50.120]   More and more of us just want to say, no, slow it down, but I don't think you can.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.120]   Can you slow it down, Shira?
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.880]   I think it's not slowing down.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.560]   I think you have a choice as to how fast you want to go because you can't control what's
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.720]   happening around you.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.480]   So I think this is where the ultimate individual choice comes into play.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:09.360]   That you choose in and then you choose out while everything is going crazy around you
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.880]   and there's a lot of chaos.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:16.920]   So I think that we're going to see a movement of people disconnecting and just going to
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   the other direction.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.920]   I can't take some more.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.480]   I actually don't even think it's about before the Civil War.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.680]   I think it's Eastern philosophy, like Buddhism.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.080]   It's cavemen.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.600]   Let's go back to pre-technology.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.880]   Yeah, I mean, I see a lot of people just connecting with themselves and saying like,
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:37.160]   I don't want to be inside on Zoom all day or on FaceTime and anti-tech.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.160]   And like, they're actually because it's like, what are you fighting for in the end?
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.320]   Are you fighting just to keep up with things?
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.480]   Are you fighting for happiness?
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.600]   And a lot of us are realizing it's like, there's more that we want in this life we want for
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.320]   our children.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:55.160]   And I think when you're young, you get excited about all this because you're all about-
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.360]   All you know is change.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.360]   All you know is change when you're little.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.360]   Exactly.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:03.880]   And as you get older, you're just kind of like, whoa, like this isn't really helping
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.480]   me with my process here because it just gets overwhelming and then you all do nothing.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.480]   And you don't-
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.720]   I think that's a sensible way.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:17.880]   What you've got is a sensible way, a cognitive way that isn't- there's also a way to say,
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880]   no, I'm going to-
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.880]   I'm-
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.280]   I don't hear you, nah-nah-nah-nah.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.280]   That's a different thing than what you're talking about.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.240]   You're talking about life skills that help you-
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.160]   Conscious intentional choice.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.160]   Yes.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.400]   Like, and I think we need to be aware of burnout.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.560]   I think that burnout comes not just from doing too much and having too much on our plate,
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.680]   but consuming too much.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:45.120]   Like, when you're taking in so much, whether it be information, auditory, visually, and
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.280]   like, I do think our minds can't handle it.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.280]   It's not-
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.280]   Yeah, no, I think-
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.280]   It's not-
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.280]   It's not-
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.280]   Calm down internally.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.120]   Slow down and think about it.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.120]   Don't get-
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.120]   Don't get-
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120]   Don't get-
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.120]   We need to-
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.120]   Do it tucked into.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.520]   We need to teach everybody to not worry about FOMO.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.000]   Don't jump on every new thing that comes along.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.280]   Take the time to understand- try to understand what it is before you adopt a new technology.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.240]   Oh, there's no time for that thing.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.240]   There's no time for that.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.160]   What are you talking about?
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:25.080]   To another thing that Shira was talking about is how much we take in, how much we absorb.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:33.600]   I know, personally, I consciously try to limit how much- I consume a lot of media, a lot
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.920]   of content every day.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.920]   That's our job, right?
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.960]   Yeah, in the process of doing my job and my research, I'm looking at a lot of things,
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:49.000]   but what I consciously try to constrain is how much politics- I know what's going on.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.120]   I take in enough to be aware of what's going on, but I don't obsess over it and consume
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.120]   every story about-
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120]   Isn't there a risk, though?
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.120]   And they'll-
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.600]   Or Elon Musk in their latest tweets.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.760]   Isn't there a risk, though, that you're going to-
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.760]   No.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.760]   No.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:03.760]   Okay.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.320]   Because if it's important, you're going to hear about it.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.120]   You don't have to read every single tweet.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.280]   There's a great phrase that's coming to currency.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.680]   And Shira, I know you're with it and a hip with the kids.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.680]   Doo-
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.680]   What?
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.680]   I've not heard of this.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.320]   Oh, this is my favorite new phrase, doom scrolling.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:30.760]   It's when you're up late at night and you're on Twitter and you can't stop doom scrolling.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:38.000]   Oh, oh, and you feel it draining every bit of joy out of you.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   Or Instagram.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   That happens on Instagram too.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   Doom scrolling.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.840]   Someone's setting the chat.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.160]   They're surprised that I hadn't heard about it.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.240]   I know, I thought for sure.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.640]   I mean, you've got the Snapchat classes.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.680]   You should know about doom.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.840]   It's a difficult world we're living in and you have to do whatever you can.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:05.960]   But I think the mistake would be to say, oh, let's just go back in time.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.960]   First of all, you can't.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:07.960]   Second.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.960]   For sure.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:09.960]   You can never go backward.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.320]   But you can change what you're doing now and adapt and try to make it better.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:19.040]   I think it's about figuring out what's good for you.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.040]   What is working in your life?
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.040]   What is not?
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.840]   And then organizing your life around that.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.440]   Because you have to figure out what you're fighting for.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:31.600]   So if you're fighting for freedom or truth or happiness, what does that actually mean
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.560]   in terms of things that you do?
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.320]   What are those things that are not bringing you that?
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:39.400]   And that becomes just a clear way to compartmentalize.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.360]   But also, I would say that be here now means don't worry about the future, but also don't
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.120]   want to live in the past.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.720]   Just be here now.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.720]   Right?
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.720]   That I need Ram Dass.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.720]   And actually, that's one of my mantras.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:52.720]   I do.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.280]   And I feel like I'm going into a neurotic spiral, which happens whether you're on social media
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.280]   or I don't know, you're waiting for that email to come through or you feel like there's
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.280]   just too much going on.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:05.320]   I just breathe in and say, I am here now.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.320]   And I'm okay.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.320]   What are you grateful for?
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:14.040]   So I think it's we're in a time of merging like modern life with once again, like I look
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:19.080]   at like Eastern philosophies, like Buddhism and all that, which I'm a big fan of.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.080]   Yes.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.080]   Let's take a little break.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.080]   I spent two years.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.080]   Go ahead.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   Sorry.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.080]   Go ahead.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.920]   No, Jason, you can't start that sentence in my phone.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.920]   I'll make it.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.920]   I'll make it.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.920]   You spent two years doing what?
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:31.920]   What?
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.920]   Hiner?
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:40.360]   I years two years, I quit Facebook and Instagram and I just spent more time reading.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:52.800]   So studying and meditation and also the other thing that I did, so started with reading
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:58.360]   and actually just calling and talking to people on the phone and trying to have a little
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:02.280]   bit at the time before social distancing, some face to face, spending more time with
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.640]   people.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.840]   Your internet is degrading right now.
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:11.320]   I don't know if that's because it doesn't want you to be here.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.320]   Oh, maybe.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.320]   Oh, man.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.320]   Let me let's tell you.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.320]   I got to take a break.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.480]   We'll fix that right now while I am taking a break.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:29.760]   Jason Hiner, CNET, wonderful fella, Samable, Samid, wheel bearing podcast, wonderful fella,
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.840]   great gal, Cherylis are.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.680]   I sound like Joe Biden right about now, don't I?
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:43.440]   She's a great gal that that Cheryl is are with the piece inside me and I love.
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.600]   Peace inside dot live.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.240]   Peace inside dot live.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.240]   All right.
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.400]   I showed today brought to you by a big fish with sharp teeth.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.400]   Barracuda.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.440]   No, not that Barracuda.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.200]   Barracuda, the provider of cloud enabled enterprise great security solutions for every
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:06.280]   business to protect email to protect your networks to protect data to protect applications.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.520]   Everybody in business knows the name Barracuda.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.360]   They're just the best.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.520]   Just the best.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:16.560]   Well, let me talk a little bit about how Barracuda can help you right now with your
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.560]   Office 365 inbox.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:24.960]   Suddenly, as we're all working from home, you have dozens, hundreds, thousands of employees
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.000]   working remotely.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.680]   Every one of them is getting tons of email every day.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:37.120]   That makes them vulnerable because 91% of all cyber attacks start in an email.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:43.720]   That's the vast majority spearfishing ransomware account takeover conversation hijacking.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:50.120]   You multiply that by the number of employees, by the number of emails, one click on one
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:56.120]   wrong email can cost the company big time money, customers reputation.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:01.720]   Barracuda researchers, they actually have a great blog at their website, barracuda.com/twit.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.880]   That's where I found this stat.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.880]   They've seen a steady increase in the number of coronavirus related spearfishing attacks
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.280]   at the beginning of the year.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.520]   In fact, since the end of February, 667% spike.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.520]   600% is incredible.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.760]   The bad guys are just jumping on this.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.000]   It's an opportunity for them.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.360]   They know employees are at home and they know they can get them with emails and personating
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:33.600]   the World Health Organization or the CDC or offering for instance information to help them
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.040]   stay healthy.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.560]   They use domain spoofing so it looks real.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.880]   How smart is your staff?
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.040]   Are they going to fall for that?
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.720]   Are you going to fall for that?
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.800]   You need Barracuda total email protection.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.880]   It includes all in one email security.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:53.000]   It also includes backup and archiving, which many businesses have to do for legal reasons.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.640]   You've got to have, it depends on the business, but sometimes as much as seven years worth
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.640]   the emails.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   You've got to archive that stuff.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.000]   It'll help you with that.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   They have AI-based protection from spearfishing and account takeover and email compromise.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.200]   You need AI because attackers are using different techniques every minute.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:15.720]   They're constantly evolving so your protection has to evolve.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:20.480]   They also have a great automated incident response that gives you options so you can
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.200]   quickly and efficiently address attacks.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.640]   We know that by the way.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:28.160]   The faster you address an attack, the faster it gets fixed.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.320]   The easier it is to fix.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:34.240]   You wait a couple of minutes and it could be curtains.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.880]   This fast incident response is really important.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.160]   Of course, you've got to keep your employees aware.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.680]   They offer security awareness training as well to educate your workforce.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:47.760]   They are after all the first line of defense and attacks.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.760]   What can you do?
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:54.520]   You can go to barracuda.com/twit right now and uncover the threats hiding in your inbox.

[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.760]   Don't be scared to push that button.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.120]   You've got to know, right?
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.000]   Ignorance is not bliss.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   Find out.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.600]   You might be shocked to learn, but fortunately Barracuda has got some solutions.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.400]   Barracuda.com/twit.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:20.080]   Find out what horrible things are lurking in your inbox.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.080]   Look under that rock.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.080]   barracuda.com/twit.
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.880]   Barracuda, your journey secured a great company to have on your team.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.840]   You've got to have some support doing this.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.480]   It's tough.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.200]   Somebody in the chatroom recommended this book by Cal Newport.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.280]   I'm not familiar with it.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.760]   Digital minimalism.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.320]   Choosing a focused life in a noisy world.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:45.680]   He said it's really the chatroom guy said it's really good.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.640]   The New York Times says he's the Marie Kondo of technology.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:53.160]   I might have to try that.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160]   Oh, sure.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.160]   You're muted.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.560]   Sorry, we muted you.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.360]   Dow, of course you did.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.480]   Dow of poo is also a good one.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.080]   Someone mentioned that's a good way.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.840]   I read that when I was like, like a kid, that's been around for ages.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:07.840]   Look at you.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.840]   Impressive.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.840]   I mean, hasn't that that's been around for a long time?
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.840]   Yeah, it's classic.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:13.840]   Benjamin Hoff.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.840]   Came out in 1983.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.720]   No, no.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:21.920]   We need the poo's 90 years old.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.760]   The Dow of poo isn't quite that.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.640]   No, it's almost 40 years old though.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.640]   That's cool.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640]   That's really cool.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:35.560]   And when I say a kid, I mean your age, Shira.
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:41.600]   Anything that happened before my 40s is when I was a kid basically.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.600]   It's depressing, but it's true.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.600]   Let's see.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.040]   What should we talk about right now?
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.000]   A couple more Apple stories and we'll move on.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:00.240]   One of the things Apple also released is betas of not only Mac OS 11, big sir, but iOS 14.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:05.760]   And one of the fascinating things that's happened is how much we've learned about apps
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.560]   on our phones that are spying on us.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:14.600]   iOS 14 has a lot more information when you install an app, when you're using an app about
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.600]   what it's doing.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.600]   And Apple's really pioneered this.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.960]   You know, you've seen and it was so effective the maps warning.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.480]   Did you know that Facebook has checked your location three times in the last 24 hours?
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.480]   Here's what it knows.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.640]   Do you want it to keep doing that?
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.480]   I think that was huge.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:35.440]   Now they're going to start showing right up front, giving you an opportunity to turn off
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.880]   the ID for advertisers.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:43.920]   Apple, like most devices, gives you a unique ID, which unless you turn it off, it will
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.160]   be shared with advertisers.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.440]   It's a way that they can know if you've seen their ad, they can verify whether they're
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.680]   ad work, that kind of thing.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.880]   Google has one too called GAID.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:01.040]   Apple's identifier for advertisers helps mobile marketers attribute ad spend.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:07.960]   But there's some real concern in the world because it will be now whenever you install
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:08.960]   an app.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.960]   Here it is.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.760]   You will see this right at the beginning.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.840]   This app would like permission to track you across apps and websites.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:19.680]   Your data will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.960]   Now you can say allow tracking, but advertisers are now extremely concerned.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.120]   This setting has always been on the iPhone, but it's never been put forward like this
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:35.000]   that people are going to say, "No, ask that app not to track me."
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000]   Concerning?
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.960]   Good news for privacy advocates, right?
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:47.400]   A lot of marketers are very upset about IDFA.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:53.200]   I've increasingly found so-called personalized advertising or targeted advertising to be less
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:28:00.040]   and less useful over the years to the point where these days, half the ads I get are for
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.720]   stuff I've already bought.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:04.400]   They're really good at recommending stuff you already bought.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.400]   Especially Amazon.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.560]   Yeah, Amazon.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.160]   People like you also bought this.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.280]   Yeah, I know because I bought it.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.960]   How many grills can one guy buy?
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.240]   I mean, I don't need any more.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.240]   That's enough.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.240]   Thank you.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.240]   I think you need at least one more.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.240]   I got my back.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.280]   I have three now.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.120]   This is way too many, but I can cook meat in any way you would like.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:31.440]   I know you guys are vegans, but Sam and I will make some brisket.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.520]   I'm still craving a good vegan burger right now.
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.760]   You're never going to get one.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.640]   That's all made up, that impossible burger.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.240]   You don't know what's in that.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.120]   That's all sorts of weird stuff.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.120]   You like it?
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.120]   Do you like the impossible?
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.360]   I like it, but there's others.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.760]   There's other brands now that are doing really well.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:53.920]   It's better though than the old days when I was a kid in my 30s where they would make
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:29:00.080]   vegan burgers at a peas and lentils and weird and it tasted like that.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.080]   Tasted like you're eating.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.160]   At least now they look and taste like a burger.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.160]   You're like a veggie.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.160]   I feel like a burger.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.160]   I'm getting hungry.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.160]   I'm getting hungry.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.160]   Sure.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.160]   That's so mean.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.160]   If you want to, you know what, take your laptop with you.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:14.800]   If you want to start dinner, go right ahead.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.080]   I feel like I know more about you, Shira.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.080]   That's the one that you're making now.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.080]   I'm hungry.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.080]   You post all this stuff on Instagram.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.760]   I feel like I know what you're eating.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.920]   I know what you're doing.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:24.920]   It's great.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:25.920]   I love it.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:33.440]   When impossible or beyond meats or somebody can finally give me an authentic seeming rack
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:40.240]   of spare ribs or pork shoulder or brisket that has no meat in it, I'm all in.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.240]   I'll do it.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.240]   I'll go for it.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:45.720]   I know it's bad for the environment and it's bad for me.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:49.000]   I do know that.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.760]   And I know it's not nice to the animals.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:55.520]   I do know that.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:56.520]   Help me, Shira.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.120]   Honestly, for me, it was similar.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:04.680]   I watched what the health that documentary few years ago.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:05.680]   I've seen it.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.320]   And then I tried the vegan knives.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.880]   And then I ended up, but I was already moving.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.320]   This is so not a discussion for it, but whatever.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.960]   I was already moving away from red meat.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.120]   I was actually having stomach issues every time I ate.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.120]   It's bad for you.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:20.200]   I couldn't even physically eat it.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.000]   My body was not letting me eat it.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   So I did vegan.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.680]   And then I went to Pescatarian.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:28.800]   And then basically when COVID started, just as everything felt like it was falling apart,
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.360]   we're just not treating animals or the earth well.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.000]   I just decided to cut everything out.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   Oh, this is new.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   I didn't know that.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.800]   Well, I've been going back and forth on it for two years, or a few years.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.800]   And this is the first time I went really all in.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:46.920]   I used to be a bit more open to cheese and eggs specifically.
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.920]   And I've just cut everything out.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.760]   Jason, you've been a vegan your whole life, right?
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.800]   No, no, no, since 2010.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:54.800]   Oh.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:55.800]   So 10 years.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:58.800]   So you look back in 2007 with Lust as well.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:06.960]   No, the funny thing is I've had really bad environmental allergies my whole life.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.600]   And when we moved to Louisville.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   I like Louisville is a great city.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:11.600]   Louisville's.
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.200]   Home of the Derby and the mud pie and.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:22.280]   I mean, you can just go over the river and get some real chilly and Cincinnati.
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:26.040]   I mean, you live in the life.
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:29.720]   But you know, I travel a lot, but Louisville is a great place to come back to.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.520]   But I got to a point where we moved.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:36.360]   We were here for a couple of years where I was like, my allergies were so bad and I
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.160]   was on a lot of medicines.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:44.400]   And my at a friend, I had a friend that we were both mostly vegetarian.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.680]   It was a college friend of mine that was from Louisville.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:52.880]   And when I moved to Louisville, we sort of reconnected and he had an ulcer.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:56.160]   So we were both kind of mostly vegetarian since college.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.560]   We'd eat chicken or fish or that once in a while.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:05.480]   But he had an ulcer and he so he had to go off all dairy and he was and he felt so much
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.840]   better and he told me he's like, you should go vegan.
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.920]   He said, that's what you should do.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:12.640]   You're having so much trouble with all this allergy and he really wanted me to stay in
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.480]   Louisville because he's a good friend.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.320]   And I was like, that's fine for you.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.520]   But look, my allergies are so severe.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:21.840]   Like it's not going to make any difference at all for me.
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:24.520]   And so finally I got so desperate.
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.360]   I was like, I will try anything.
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:29.520]   I will do anything if it would help me feel better.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:34.160]   And I started going vegan and all of a sudden and I used to have these like really debilitating
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.160]   headaches.
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:38.600]   When I traveled, I would never eat meat similar to what Shara is saying.
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:42.000]   My stomach, the worst thing is you're going to give a presentation or have a meeting or
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.440]   something and your guts are killing you.
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:51.720]   And so I was already kind of on that path.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:58.280]   And then when I did this, when I got so desperate and I tried it, all of a sudden I wasn't getting
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.440]   headaches all the time.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.760]   I would go off all of my medicine, my allergy medicine.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:07.080]   I had like five allergy medicines, went off all of it.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:11.120]   And all of a sudden I was like, this is what it feels like to be normal.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:14.640]   I had so much more energy.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:19.680]   I wasn't feeling sort of sick all the time.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:20.680]   And I felt better.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.840]   I was in my 30s.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:27.520]   I was like, I feel better than I felt in my 20s because I just didn't realize that all
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:30.160]   of this was making me feel so bad.
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:35.240]   So that's just my case. I probably had some sensitivity, especially like dairy and meat.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:39.080]   I have AB plus blood type, which is the newest blood type.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.000]   Yeah, you need to know your blood type too.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.160]   That's a bad one.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.280]   That's the one that gets COVID right away.
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:45.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:47.360]   It's the newest blood type.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:52.000]   It's only been around because what did people do before AB?
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.680]   Um, B and A.
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:56.760]   What do you mean?
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.040]   It's been around since I've been humans.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.040]   I would presume.
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:05.960]   No, no, no, since, so since humans started mixing, but you're kidding.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:06.960]   Different regions.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:07.960]   No, no.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.040]   Yeah, it's only around since humans from different regions.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:13.760]   So you have a type that didn't exist till when?
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.040]   Yeah, it's the new.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.440]   I can't remember the exact.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.920]   It's AB plus.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:19.560]   Is that weird?
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.560]   AB positive.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:25.680]   Yeah, positive because until so all four of my grandparents are different ethnicities.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:30.760]   And so that's partly why I have, you know, AB positive because the, you know, genetics,
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.960]   sort of they come together and they literally have to make a new blood type because they're
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:37.240]   like, we can't, you know, DNA sort of, you know, right?
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:39.920]   Less than 4% of the population has AB positive.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.360]   But here's some good news.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.400]   You're known as the universal recipient because you can get blood cells from all blood types.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.400]   Guess what?
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.640]   I'm, oh, positive.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:49.960]   I'm the universal donor.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:52.960]   You do the one everybody wants their blood from.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:55.760]   If you ever want to hear my blood, Jason, I'm here for you.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.160]   Actually, you could take blood from anybody, right?
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.160]   Right.
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:00.160]   That's right.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.160]   Exactly.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.160]   I don't know how we got into this.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:03.160]   Sorry.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:04.160]   And that was my fault.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.160]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.240]   I like, you know, I asked, I started it.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.240]   I started it.
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.240]   We're educating people.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:13.680]   Maybe there'll be some people that will shift and learn more because of this.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.680]   True.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.240]   The chat room said to me, you're an alien, Jason, just admitted.
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.240]   That's it.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:22.640]   So we're, I didn't know there was like a new blood type like never before seen.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:23.840]   A new blood type.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.840]   Who knew?
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:28.600]   Until, until more, there was more migration of different human beings.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:29.600]   Exactly.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.160]   Mixing of different, you know, sort of ethnic groups.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.760]   That's, that's when it came about.
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.840]   I had no idea.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:40.120]   So the other thing, apples, iOS.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.080]   Oh my God.
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:47.680]   I feel like the nerd at the party is like, so, and then let's talk more about iOS because
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.840]   I'm not done.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:54.200]   The latest privacy revelation in iOS, I guess it also will let you know if something's
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:00.440]   snooping your clipboard and a bunch of apps first to start it with TikTok.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:05.720]   So it's actually our, our good friend from Moji Pedia, Jamie Jeremy-Bruch tweeted, every
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:13.200]   time I type in another app, Apple's iOS 14 is saying, Oh, TikTok just looked at your clipboard.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.600]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.160]   And it turns out it's not just TikTok.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:25.280]   In fact, I think LinkedIn just apologized saying, yeah, our app does that too, but that's a
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.800]   bug and we're going to fix that.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.760]   I don't know if it's a bug or they just, or people are just getting busted now.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.000]   56 apps, I think at last.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.760]   Well, apparently LinkedIn, it was actually logged getting, grabbing every, every key press.
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.760]   Oh, great.
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:41.760]   So that must be a bug.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:42.760]   Every single key.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:43.760]   You don't want that.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:44.760]   It was checking the LinkedIn.
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:46.560]   I thought I didn't think it actually was a bug.
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:48.560]   Wow.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.560]   But again, I think this is great.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:54.800]   You got to praise Apple because they're exposing bad behavior, whether it's intentional
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.160]   or accidental.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:00.160]   They're exposing bad behavior and people who use iPhones will now know.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.520]   As soon as iOS 14 comes out this fall, they'll now know what's going on.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.640]   Good thing.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.960]   Apple also, last Apple, last one, Apple also doing, I think the right thing.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:13.240]   This is a little more controversial.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.440]   They declined.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:21.720]   So the worldwide web consortium proposes new APIs all the time for browsers to support.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:28.080]   Apple has declined 16 proposals due to privacy concerns in Safari.
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.040]   This is Steve Gibson went through this list on Tuesday and security now is kind of mind
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.160]   boggling.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:41.880]   This is not going to be in Safari, but I think Chrome browsers maybe.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:45.920]   The vast majority of these only implemented in Chromium based browsers, not so many in
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.200]   Mozilla.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.640]   So web Bluetooth allows a website to connect to a nearby Bluetooth LE device.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.640]   Wow.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:54.640]   What could go wrong?
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.040]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:02.600]   Web MIDI allows it to a new, this is a website, a numerate, manipulate and access mini devices.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:07.960]   A website can now use the magnetometer in your phone to access data about the local
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:11.200]   magnetic field around you.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:15.600]   There's an FC API, a memory API.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:19.200]   The browser can actually, you can query the browser as a website and then we'll tell you
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:22.880]   how much device memory there is.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:30.960]   Network information, battery status, ambient light sensor, you can, a website, go to website,
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.720]   the website, you say, could you turn on the lights?
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.400]   It's a little dark in here.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.640]   This is crazy stuff proximity sensor.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:42.400]   This is all built into Chrome, but Apple is not going to put this in here.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.320]   Also a user idle detection.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.760]   So a website can say, hey, I see you're not watching.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:49.760]   Look at me.
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.760]   Look at me.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.760]   Look at me.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:56.000]   The real concern Apple has is not so much these individual capabilities, but this is
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.960]   a very widespread, now that the IDFA is, people are going to be turning that off, people
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:09.440]   use these APIs to query the browser about a variety of aspects of this user.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.720]   It doesn't take very many, half dozen, before you get a unique fingerprint.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:19.040]   They could say, well, I know it's Shira because these are the Bluetooth devices I can see.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:23.080]   This is how much memory she has, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:28.320]   They can put it all together and it's a way to fingerprint you in a very risky way.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:34.800]   This is all digital fingerprinting stuff because all of these companies in the internet ecosystem
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.960]   that rely on advertising, which is huge business, right?
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:45.640]   They know that the cookies are coming to an end, that users are not okay with it.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:50.560]   It's essentially, they're looking for all of these little bits of data that they can
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:57.360]   collect and that they can do to pinpoint you without a cookie, right?
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:04.240]   It is very consumer friendly of Apple to push back against these things because these are
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:11.960]   those things that slide in under the radar, they make their way into technology like cookies
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:19.640]   did and people not, can the average consumer not understanding how anti-consumer and anti-privacy
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:22.360]   it is until it's too late.
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:30.040]   I don't think this will stop it because Safari is only a certain percentage of the population,
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:35.880]   but it is Apple can do it because it's something they can control.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:41.760]   Chrome, I have to think, will adopt all of these things and it will essentially replace
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.360]   the cookie with these digital fingerprinting techniques.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:49.120]   Because Google's advertising friendly, that's their business.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:54.640]   On the other hand, I'm going to make the case for it because what we are seeing increasingly
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:59.840]   is web sites and web apps that are as powerful as desktop apps.
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.360]   And there is definitely a trend towards that.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:07.080]   We've talked a lot about the move towards thin client computing and progressive web apps
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:13.840]   and the idea that why would we need a Twit app if we could make the site a progressive
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:18.680]   web app that has the capabilities of an app that you could even save a bookmark on the
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:22.160]   desktop and even if you're offline, it would continue to work.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.160]   That would be a good thing.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.800]   And I think there's a strong case for that.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.280]   That's kind of where the world is moving.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.280]   So I think-
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:30.280]   It's the dream.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:31.280]   I don't know.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:32.280]   It's the dream.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.360]   I don't think the W-3C is the bunch of PWAs on my phone, including Twitter.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.160]   I don't have the Twitter app installed on my phone.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.160]   It's an excellent TWA.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:42.160]   I just have their PWA on my home screen.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:47.560]   And I don't think the W-3C is introducing these APIs in an attempt to make fingerprinting
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.560]   possible.
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:51.600]   By the way, there's a lot of fingerprinting going on already.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:58.200]   For instance, in the ZDNet article about this, they point out the Do Not Track setting
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:02.960]   is often used to fingerprint because it doesn't do anything.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:07.440]   But if you've got it on, that's one more piece of information I have about you.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.240]   Support for custom fonts.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.840]   If I can list the fonts you have installed, I know I can pretty much uniquely identify
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.840]   you again and again and again.
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.840]   These are all things that I think are useful.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.320]   So who's to blame about this?
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:24.680]   I think this is AdTech is to blame because I think these technologies would be nice to
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:25.680]   have.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.840]   It would be nice to have more capabilities for websites in your browser.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.080]   So what's the fine line then?
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.080]   I don't know.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:37.480]   Like what's the line between something that helps you is productive for the people like
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:43.280]   you and then your consumers, your viewers, but then doesn't encroach on privacy or steal
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.480]   necessarily.
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:50.080]   I think rather than blocking these, what Apple should do is sandbox them.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:55.240]   There's got to be a way that you can keep these technologies in the browser without letting
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.680]   them access the outside world somehow.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.360]   I'm not sure though.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.760]   I don't know.
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:10.360]   It's another one of these best quality, worst quality things where it does all these good
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.360]   things.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.960]   They're going to allow you to not install an app because once you install that app all
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.120]   is in, you've given up a ton of permissions to accompany it.
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:20.480]   But think about it that we do that all the time.
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.600]   Computing is an act of trust.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:25.840]   You don't know what the source, for most programs you can't see the source code.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.600]   You don't know what a program is doing.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.400]   I'm saying an app versus the web app.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:34.840]   The web app, you can maintain a little more control and some of these features would help
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:38.320]   companies build better progressive web apps that's a good thing.
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.240]   That's going to do sort of what we want.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:43.600]   But at the same time, when you do that.
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:50.380]   Now, all of a sudden, you've enabled this tracking at the web browser level or at least
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:57.680]   you've enabled bad actors or even maybe somewhat bad actors to have the ability to use that
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.480]   and exploit that to track you in ways that you're not completely comfortable with.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:10.360]   I'm very aware, as you must be, of the tension between privacy on the one hand for consumers
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:13.320]   and the need to monetize on the other hand.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:17.560]   That's the first thing that's going to do is to make sure that there's a website or
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.560]   a podcast.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:25.040]   When we run our ads, the nice thing about RSS podcasts and one of the reasons they're
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:29.800]   probably dying is because RSS doesn't give us any information about our user.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:30.800]   They're just downloading.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:36.680]   We see the hit to the website, but all that gives us is an IP address which we don't preserve
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:39.240]   and don't use.
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:43.160]   But advertisers want to know more about, they want to know, they ask me all the time,
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:46.400]   "Well, how do I know that the last ad in the show was heard?"
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.400]   I don't know.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.600]   How do you know that that in the magazine was read?
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:50.600]   I don't know.
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:54.760]   How do you know the guy's not making a sandwich during your billion dollar football commercial?
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:55.760]   I don't know.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:02.400]   But that's so stupid because billboards, like 20-cent or billboards still, and it's like,
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:05.440]   "How do you know they're looking up from their car?"
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:09.440]   But you know why they do this because Facebook and Google can tell them.
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:10.840]   That's right.
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:15.960]   So you and I and everybody else here, we're all competing against these behemoths who
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:20.000]   don't mind spying on you in every way possible.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.160]   Which is why they need your lies on that too.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.160]   Unfortunately.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.920]   It's why they swept in and ate out 80% of the market and between the two of them, they
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:32.400]   own 80% of the advertising.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:36.760]   Of all advertising everywhere is now controlled by two companies.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.840]   Put yourself in the advertiser's shoes.
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:48.040]   If you can tell me, if I can say, "You know, I just want 53-year-old men living in the
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.080]   New York City Metro," you can buy that on Facebook.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.080]   And it's cheap, by the way.
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.080]   Yes.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:57.760]   And then I was going to say, in media it doesn't have the money to build out their own tech
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:59.640]   and the companies that do our huge companies.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:03.640]   And so it's like, how are smaller publishers supposed to do that?
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:08.760]   Which is why then they build all their media campaigns or audience on social.
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.520]   So it's just a really weird relationship.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:17.920]   I have to say though, Apple's virtue comes because they couldn't get their own ad tech
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:18.920]   working.
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:19.920]   Right?
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.920]   For sure.
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:21.920]   They had eye ads.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.480]   They wanted to do this, but it failed.
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.360]   They crashed in burn and they said, "You know what?
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.080]   We're going to turn this into our best feature."
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:32.640]   That's a feature, not a bug.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:39.680]   On the other hand, I'm worried glad Apple exists and does kind of fight for the end user.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.800]   But it's a larger issue.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:43.560]   You're stripping out capabilities in browsers.
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:51.920]   You're stripping out the ability of sites like your old tech republic to monetize.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.760]   This is happening in podcasting too.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:47:00.480]   That's the reason Joe Rogan was worth $100 million to Spotify and note that that $100
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.080]   million payday came with Spotify exclusivity.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:10.000]   He shows will no longer be on YouTube.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000]   Nor will they be downloadable via RSS.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.040]   You'll have to use the Spotify app to listen to Joe Rogan.
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.240]   Why do you think that is?
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:22.040]   Because Spotify app knows exactly where you are, who you are, what you're doing.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:24.720]   It's not that they need to sell ads against it.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.920]   They can, but they have that information.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.080]   That's valuable information.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:35.560]   Well, they do want to figure out what else to put in front of you that you'll listen
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.560]   to.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.920]   Yeah, it's valuable for them too.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:38.920]   That's right.
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:39.920]   The content.
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:40.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:46.880]   The upside does, I don't know about anybody else, but for wheel bearings, very few people
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.080]   listen to it in Spotify.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.080]   No, almost nobody.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:54.160]   But don't you worry about the day when all the podcast, if they can get all the big
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:48:01.720]   podcast, they bought Gimlet, they got Joe Rogan, that the day will come when all of
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:06.160]   the podcast advertising money will be going to Spotify, just as 80% of it is now going
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:07.800]   to Facebook and Google.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:09.960]   But are there ads on Spotify?
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.960]   If you have Spotify premium, there's no ads.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:12.960]   No ads.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:18.120]   So they get you either way, either you listen to free one and then there ads or you pay
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:20.760]   them not to have ads.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:21.760]   Right?
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.760]   People are paying.
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:30.760]   But they're banking you on paying for the monthly versus it being, you know, like on
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.160]   Apple, just a different model.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.160]   They make a lot.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:34.160]   They have what?
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:35.160]   90 million paid subscribers?
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.160]   They're doing all right.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:39.160]   I think that's 90 million total total.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.160]   Oh, okay.
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.160]   Free and paid.
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.360]   I wonder how many they have of that as paid, what percentage?
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:48.680]   I mean, I was using, I have a funny story about free Spotify.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:50.480]   Someone just posted, I still use a free Spotify.
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:54.760]   I was too until I was, you know, single and dating and I'd be hanging out with a guy
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.000]   in my place and like a romantic music would be on and then an ad would pop up.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.120]   And then if you want a bit of car, come see Cal.
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:07.140]   If you want to find your car and come see Cal, that really puts a little damper on the
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.140]   make out session.
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:09.140]   Come on.
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:12.640]   I'm getting spotted by premium tomorrow.
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:13.640]   Okay.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:21.280]   Because of the first quarter of 2020, Spotify had 130 million premium subscribers worldwide.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.360]   So they're doing okay.
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:29.600]   So you and I had the old number, the way old number, 124.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.600]   Let's see.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:33.680]   They gained 6 million paid subscribers during COVID.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.080]   So that's, they're doing all right.
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.080]   Uh, you know, they're doing fine.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.880]   They've spent almost a billion dollars.
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:41.320]   They can afford to send me a check for a hundred million dollars.
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.320]   I'll take it.
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:43.320]   I'll take it.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:45.200]   Pot would Elon must do it.
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.200]   I don't know.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.200]   I don't.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:51.640]   Well, frankly, I think that's the only way I'd want to be in a room with Elon.
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.640]   Only tolerable way to be in a room with you.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:56.240]   Actually, I'm going to say something because we are doing, we are trying something on some
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:57.240]   of our shows.
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:01.640]   There are some of our shows, uh, older shows, long tail shows like triangulation.
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:06.920]   Um, and then, uh, shows like twig that don't have a lot of advertising twig, for instance,
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:10.560]   is chronically, uh, short on advertising and we can't get anybody to buy it.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:11.560]   I don't know why.
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.160]   They just don't like the name, but advertisers are funny.
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:19.000]   We talked to an advertiser the other day that said, oh, we don't want to buy an ad on twig
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.680]   because it's, it's on Sunday.
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.680]   What?
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:23.360]   It's on Sunday.
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.720]   We don't want to, we only want to advertise shows during the week.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:27.720]   Okay.
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.520]   Like, like, what?
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.280]   They literally don't get the most like it.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.080]   You know, 60 minutes is on Sunday too.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.080]   Is it a bad day?
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.840]   A wonderful world of color that Walt Disney was on Sunday is the number one TV viewing
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:39.840]   day.
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:40.840]   Anyway.
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:41.840]   You know, football, all.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:42.840]   Sunday.
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:44.840]   Who would want to buy that?
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:45.840]   That's weird.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.680]   That's like reminds you when I do ads on Instagram or like sponsor deals, they'll be like, can
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.160]   you put it up during the week?
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:53.720]   And I'm like, well, what if the weekend is better for my engagement?
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:54.960]   Like, no, no, we rather.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:56.960]   They're so strange.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:59.360]   So, so it's advertiser strange.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:02.200]   Anyway, um, we're going to, we are going to try something and I wanted to actually tell
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:07.360]   people this because we started doing it called direct insertion ads and the way it
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:11.200]   works, you go, we go through a company called megaphone and the way it works, if a show
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:14.840]   doesn't have an ad, we don't work or do more ads.
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:18.000]   We only do one ad per half hour on any show.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.960]   But if a show like Twig has one or two ads instead of three, the normal, we will put
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:27.640]   a little beacon, a little tone in that ad.
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:30.760]   And if megaphone can sell it, they'll insert an ad there.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:34.400]   And it, and it's only an audio.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:37.720]   It's not on the video because they don't have the technology to do that.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:38.800]   So we're going to try that.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:43.640]   But I have to say the reason that works is because at least in that case, an advertiser
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:45.280]   can buy a geo located ad.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:48.560]   They don't know anything about the people, but they could say, look, I only want to buy
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:50.360]   the US.
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:54.240]   You know, when we sell 30% of our minds outside the US, they could say, I only want to buy
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.240]   the US.
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:58.120]   I only want to buy the West Coast or I only want to buy Nebraska or whatever.
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.920]   So we're going to see how that works.
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:00.920]   It's an experiment.
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.600]   I heard one of those on Twig this week.
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.320]   And I hear what was the ad because it's different ads.
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:06.320]   I have no idea.
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:07.320]   I can't remember.
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:12.360]   Because that's, I mean, it was actually, it was a, it was a very short ad.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.960]   It seemed like it was, you know, no more than 30 seconds.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:17.600]   You know, maybe it's sort of 15 seconds.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:20.320]   It's like the way it's been for years and other media.
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:22.120]   It's just never been on podcast.
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:26.280]   And I don't, I do not remember what it was because it's very effective.
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:31.440]   You can see post red ads are, no, seriously, they are much more effective.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:32.440]   I agree.
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:36.840]   Especially when you incorporate something, you know, like incorporate your own experience
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:39.040]   into it, you know, which you guys do.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:45.240]   And I know many other shows that I listen to do that, you know, and it, it sinks in a
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.240]   lot more.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:49.200]   I wouldn't be drinking mushroom coffee if it weren't for Joe Rogan.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.440]   No, I don't drink glass.
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:52.440]   You do that.
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:54.600]   I was like, Oh, no, no.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:57.840]   Although I do actually, I micro dose today.
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:59.880]   These are, this was my micro dose tincture.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.880]   Oh, of what?
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:04.520]   L. S. G. No, sure.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.280]   My good is I'm a proponent of a show.
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:07.280]   Silla Simon.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.640]   Magic mushrooms.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:11.640]   But how micro is it?
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:13.280]   So you're tripping right now.
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:15.600]   Are you tripping balls right now?
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:18.240]   It can help with the depression anxiety.
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:21.000]   Yes, used for PTSD and stuff.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.440]   Yeah, I actually interviewed the founder of maps, the Pulte disciplinary association
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:28.440]   of psychedelic studies.
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:33.920]   It is for certain.
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:38.480]   When I do this, does it look like there's my fingers or there's?
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:43.800]   No, it's not that micro dose is so small.
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:45.000]   It's like you don't feel it.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.200]   It's just like taking a Tylenol.
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.400]   Oh, I took, I have to, I'll be very honest.
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:51.080]   I took a lot of acid when I was young.
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.720]   And I think it explains a lot.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:57.680]   Steve Jobs always said that the reason Bill Gates was no good and Michael's because he
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:58.680]   never took acid.
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:01.840]   Steve Jobs was a big proponent of LSD.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:02.840]   I am not.
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:03.840]   I'm not kids.
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:04.840]   Be cool.
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:08.680]   You heard Tim Ferris is like putting a lot of money into John Hopkins University their
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:09.680]   research.
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:12.320]   Everybody's in the micro dosing in Silicon Valley now.
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:16.440]   Yeah, FDA is soon going to there on like the final steps of approving it, but it would
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:20.040]   be for medicinal ketamine.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.640]   Ketamine is used for depression.
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:22.640]   Yeah, ketamine too.
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:27.360]   All these things and MDMA as well.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:33.200]   So when you say micro dose, like if you drank a whole bottle, would you trip?
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.040]   I mean, you would have to have like maybe half a gram or one gram, even a trip like you
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:39.040]   have to have a lot.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:42.160]   So yeah, you'd have to have a lot like three grams.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.880]   If you do a shroom journey, usually it's like at least three grams.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.640]   I mean, I'm not a huge expert, but I'm definitely like you are.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:50.000]   I hate to say it.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.040]   You know, if you want to shroom journey, we could, it could be a range.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:55:01.640]   I do like, listen, how much have we prescribed drugs to people like opioid addiction?
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:02.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:03.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.280]   I'd rather you micro dose that than take Oxycontin during the show.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:09.280]   Exactly.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:14.120]   And it's also like people get addicted to Adderall or like how many other things.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:16.320]   And it's just like those things are not good for you.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:17.320]   This is natural.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:19.320]   It's nature's best.
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:20.640]   It's a mushroom.
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:22.840]   It's a different kind of mushroom than what I was talking about.
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:25.840]   And what I sound like.
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:26.840]   I'm not.
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:28.840]   Stuff like mushrooms and cannabis.
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:30.840]   That stuff has some real value.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:31.840]   Right in the dragon.
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.000]   That's a different mushroom altogether.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.160]   That's interesting.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:37.360]   Thank you for sharing that with us.
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.880]   That's very brave of you.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:42.240]   Hey, I'm, I am living the authentic life.
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:43.240]   I love that.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:44.240]   I'm all about.
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:46.240]   Beaking my truth.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.240]   And you find it helpful.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:49.360]   Yeah, I found it.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:51.640]   I had really eye opening experiences.
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:52.640]   Nice.
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:54.320]   I love psychedelics when I was young.
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:55.320]   I mean, really young.
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.320]   And these things, you're not seeing things.
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:00.440]   You're just processing your emotions in a different way.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:01.440]   Right.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:02.640]   I mean, sometimes you feel it.
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:03.640]   Do you feel it?
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:04.640]   Do you know that like?
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:05.640]   No, not right now.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:10.640]   No, like for me, usually when I take a microdose, I definitely have more focus and less anxiety.
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:11.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:13.640]   That's nice.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.720]   Well, that's for me, a cup of coffee.
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.920]   Actually coffee makes you anxious.
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:19.120]   I still coffee too, but yeah, you can get anxiety.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:20.440]   Yeah, it makes me very anxious.
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:21.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.440]   It gives me the shakes.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:24.760]   Yeah, caffeine does.
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:26.480]   Yeah, I think this is right now.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.520]   This is kind of the little secret of Silicon Valley.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:32.040]   Microdosing is very popular right now.
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:35.480]   And I think people think it's tripping that you're high, but you're not high.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:36.480]   You're not.
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:39.920]   That's the thing is there's a lot of misunderstanding around it.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.240]   So I would just encourage everyone just to do some research.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:45.880]   Like there's been a lot of great articles around that and Tim Ferris shares a lot about
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:46.880]   it.
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.400]   He's a huge supporter as well.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.400]   Interesting.
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:50.400]   Interesting.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.400]   I'd like to direct insertion advertising.
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:53.400]   Sorry.
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.960]   How did we go down that rabbit hole?
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:00.160]   I want to do direct insertion psychedelics.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:01.160]   Can I do that?
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:02.160]   Is that okay?
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:05.200]   Anyway, you may hear that on Twig.
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.160]   And honestly, we're just trying it as an experiment.
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:10.800]   If you hate it, I think it's interesting that you heard that Sam.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:15.360]   And in theory, those are going to be, I think, geo-targeted.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.640]   But I don't know, since you don't remember the advertiser.
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:22.760]   And it's not as much as we charge for a host red endorsement at obviously.
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:24.960]   But if it saves a show, I'm all for it.
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:29.840]   And to be frank, advertising dollars have gotten very tight in COVID.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:32.440]   Actually I want to take a little break.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:38.600]   But when we speak in the ads, but when we come back, I do want to talk about how quarantine
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:42.200]   is going to change as changing our perspective on a lot of things.
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:47.560]   And it came to me yesterday because we bought something at Dick's Sporting Goods, but it
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.400]   was a very different experience.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:52.960]   And I'm wondering if that experience is going to continue even after quarantine.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:54.440]   But we'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:58.080]   I showed today, I brought to you by Cashfly, quite literally brought to you by Cashfly.
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:01.080]   They are our CDN, our content delivery network.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:02.760]   They've been doing it since 1999.
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:10.080]   We've been using them since 2000, I'd say since 2007 or 2008, a long time.
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.760]   When we first started doing Twig, we were doing the web download and then that didn't
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:15.760]   work.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:18.480]   And I was like, "Torton, Matt Levine at Cashfly was so great.
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:22.080]   He called me up and said, "Leo, we can let us help you."
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:23.480]   And we've been on Cashfly ever since.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:24.840]   The best experience.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.000]   You may not notice it, but you would notice it if we weren't.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.480]   When your podcast application downloads our show without a hitch instantly, or when you're
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:39.200]   going to the website and you can watch that stream, all of that is because of Cashfly.
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:45.120]   Cashfly is an amazing global content delivery network.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:47.400]   And now even better because they're...
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:48.720]   So this is a little tricky.
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:51.200]   If you use a CDN, you'll understand this.
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:56.600]   The source material for the stuff on the Cash servers comes from your origin.
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:59.080]   And in our case, it's probably Amazon S3 or something like that.
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:00.480]   That's where the files are.
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:02.240]   And then when somebody goes to download...
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:08.120]   That first person downloads the podcast, goes to a CDN, a Cashfly server somewhere.
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:09.720]   It downloads a copy, keeps that copy.
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.840]   It's cached there.
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:12.800]   There's the name Cashfly.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:15.080]   For a while so that people can continue to get it fast.
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:16.440]   You get it from a server that's near you.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:18.600]   It's cached much faster than the origin.
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:24.720]   The problem is those origin hits can cost us a lot of money.
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:29.320]   That's why Cashfly has introduced something called 100% Cash Shield.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:33.560]   With this feature, you're going to benefit a drastic reduction in data transfer fees
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:38.800]   with sites like AWS's S3 and other cloud storage origins because your Cashhit ratio
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:41.120]   suddenly gets to 100%.
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:45.040]   Instead of storing it on these third parties, you store it on Cashfly.
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:49.520]   So you don't have the no more Cash misses.
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:51.720]   Your origin spend goes down by thousands a month.
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:54.960]   This is such a great idea.
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:56.480]   I wish they'd done it this years ago.
[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:57.480]   It's so brilliant.
[01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:05.240]   With 100% Cash Shield and Cashfly's guaranteed availability, no more eviction for large one-off
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:08.760]   requests costing you a fortune in data transfer out fees.
[02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:13.200]   It's a next generation content delivery solution for today and tomorrow.
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.440]   A dedicated storage space just for you.
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:17.680]   Cashfly just keeps getting better and better.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:19.400]   I love Cashfly.
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:22.320]   Shielding reduces your origin spend.
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:26.680]   Also make sure that the data will flow.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:31.120]   Customers want their 4K content delivered instantly anytime on any device anywhere in
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:32.200]   the world.
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:33.840]   Your webpage should load like that.
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:35.160]   There's no video buffering.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.240]   Your game should download.
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:37.240]   Your app should download.
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:42.080]   Every year storing content on the net for your customers, you need to have a come in fast.
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:44.400]   That's what Cashfly does for us.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:48.680]   Lightning fast digital download speeds for large digital files no matter where your customers
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:49.680]   are.
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:51.200]   They're global throughput performance dominance.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:56.120]   Assures any Cash misses are delivered five times faster than if you're getting it from
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:58.120]   S3 or some other origin.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.880]   I think this is a brilliant idea.
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.440]   One more way Cashfly is amazing.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.560]   Here's the deal.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:11.880]   If you host content on the net, whether it's a podcast, music, games, apps, web content,
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:13.720]   you need to find out what Cashfly can do for you.
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:17.840]   They can probably save you as much as 20% on your build they sure did for us.
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:20.560]   They could probably speed things up.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:21.560]   But here's the way to find out.
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:23.360]   Go to twit.cashfly.com.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:28.720]   They will give you a no pressure complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.240]   and your usage trends.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:32.240]   Get cashfly.com.
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:36.160]   We thank Cashfly so much for their support.
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:40.000]   Couldn't do it without your Cashfly.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.800]   I went, Lisa wanted a volleyball net so we could play volleyball.
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:46.800]   How cool.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:47.800]   Yeah, right?
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.800]   Because we can't go outside.
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:52.880]   So we put it out in the yard and we could have some fun.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.040]   We're not going to go to the gym.
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:58.640]   We could order it in Amazon and it would come.
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:02.120]   I think she looked and it would come in a few days or a week.
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:05.600]   We wanted it yesterday for the Fourth of July.
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:09.320]   The local sporting goods store, you go online, you order it.
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:10.880]   They say, "Okay, I'll be ready in 30 minutes.
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:12.080]   You drive by."
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:17.240]   When you do the order, you give them your car make it model so that when you drive up,
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.240]   they go, "Oh, there's Lisa."
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:22.480]   They put the volleyball in the car and she drives off.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.360]   Now that's obviously curbside delivery.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:29.640]   A lot of restaurants are doing it, a lot of businesses are doing it because of COVID.
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:32.160]   But after that experience, I thought, "You know what?
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:34.360]   Why would they go back?"
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:39.280]   What if a lot of brick and mortar stores, because they're one advantage over Amazon?
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.280]   It's not price.
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:41.440]   It's not convenience.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.920]   Is it you can get it today?
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:43.920]   What is that?
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:44.920]   What is that?
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:45.920]   Convenience.
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:46.920]   Well, that's the big convenience.
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:47.920]   Yes.
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:48.920]   Yeah.
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:50.920]   So, I mean, a convenience in a sense that you just go to the web and you order it.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:54.520]   If you're not in a hurry, getting it in two days from Amazon is fine.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.360]   But what if you wanted it today?
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:01.200]   I can imagine brick and mortar stores, which are struggling anyway, turning into essentially
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:03.480]   instant pickup warehouses and restaurants too.
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:07.320]   I wonder, "We're getting used to having takeout."
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:08.480]   I wonder how many restaurants...
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:10.000]   I mean, we like to socialize.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000]   We like to get together.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.280]   I'm sure you can't wait to have a nice dinner date.
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:23.640]   But I have a feeling a lot of businesses are discovering a new form.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:24.640]   What do you think?
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:25.640]   A new form of business.
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:28.800]   So, yeah, there was a trend towards flash kitchens before this.
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:29.800]   Yes.
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.720]   Because it was too much hard to maintain restaurants.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:32.720]   It just like...
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:33.720]   It did make sense to find a group.
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:34.720]   Just do the cooking.
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:35.720]   Yes.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:37.560]   You just have the kitchen and then people order it.
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:38.560]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:39.560]   What do you think?
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:40.560]   Yeah.
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:46.040]   I've done the curbside delivery quite a few times now over the last several months.
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:52.560]   From places like Petco to get dog food and Best Buy and a few other places, as well as
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.000]   some restaurants.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.520]   And it works.
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:04:06.000]   I suspect that a lot of maybe the locations that maybe have lower revenue, lower foot
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:12.920]   traffic may shift to doing that, going to a smaller footprint store where they don't
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:19.840]   have to have all the inventory out, basically just a smaller warehouse and do just curbside
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:21.160]   deliveries.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:26.640]   But for a lot of products, there's a lot of times when you actually want to go and browse
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:27.640]   and...
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:30.720]   You've got to try that zoom shirt before you buy it.
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:31.720]   I don't understand that.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:32.720]   Exactly.
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:34.760]   You want to make sure that it matches the color of your...
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:35.760]   Your color drop.
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:36.760]   Yeah.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.760]   That works for you.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:39.520]   I have to admit though, I did something really weird yesterday.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:43.160]   I ordered a suit online.
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:45.480]   It's a sponsor of ours.
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:46.880]   I don't think they're still a sponsor.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:47.880]   It used to be a sponsor.
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:48.880]   Indochino?
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:50.080]   No, there's a lot of them now, aren't there?
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:51.560]   This was Taylor's store.
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:56.240]   You put the phone on the ground and it takes pictures of you.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:57.240]   Wow.
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:58.240]   That's cool.
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:00.480]   Well, I've gotten shirts from them.
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:01.480]   That's fine.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:06.160]   But now they have suits and I thought, I need a funeral suit.
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:09.360]   Okay, this is a little creepy.
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:10.360]   Is this for real?
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:11.360]   I...
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.360]   Nobody's dying, but I figured...
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.720]   Oh my God, this is dark.
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:15.160]   I should have a black suit.
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:16.160]   Wow.
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:17.160]   Don't you think...
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:19.200]   Well, that's just classic and sophisticated.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:21.440]   Yeah, it's like a little black dress.
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:23.960]   You got to have a black thing that you can wear.
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:29.040]   So I would probably wear it at other places besides funerals, but it's probably useful.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.360]   And I figure if this goes on a lot longer, I'm gonna see...
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:33.400]   We invited some funerals.
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:34.400]   So anyway...
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.400]   Oh my God.
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:36.400]   I know that's morbid, isn't it?
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:37.880]   Well, actually, no, you probably wouldn't.
[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:38.880]   If it's cold.
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:39.880]   Right, there are no funerals.
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:43.400]   Oh, yeah, you just need a shirt and a jacket.
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:44.400]   You wouldn't need pants.
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.400]   Yeah.
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:46.400]   That's right.
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:47.400]   You need to get your zoom jacket.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:51.480]   My ex-boyfriend showed up at his grandmother's funeral over Zoom in bed wearing nothing.
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.400]   No, no, that's not nice.
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.400]   Grab a...
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:56.400]   I did order a black shirt.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:57.400]   That's a bloody story.
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:58.400]   Why is my ex-boy?
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:05:59.400]   Yeah.
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:00.400]   That is...
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:01.400]   You know what?
[02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:02.400]   I'm glad you broke up with him because that's weird.
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:03.400]   No, he's a good guy.
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:04.400]   Sorry, that was bad.
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:05.400]   That was a drag.
[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:06.400]   No, he was a...
[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:07.400]   Yeah.
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:08.400]   I remember him.
[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:10.480]   Yeah, the YouTuber.
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.480]   Yeah.
[02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:12.480]   Who are you talking about?
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:13.480]   Yeah.
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:14.480]   Yeah.
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:15.480]   We won't name any names.
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:17.480]   We don't want his ears to turn red.
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:19.120]   But yeah.
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:22.240]   So see, I know more about you because I follow you on Instagram.
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:23.240]   Actually, I don't anymore.
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:25.120]   I killed my Instagram and Facebook account.
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:26.120]   I know.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:27.120]   I said, "That's it.
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:28.120]   I'm done.
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:29.120]   No more doom scrolling for me."
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:30.120]   Mm.
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:31.120]   That's healthy.
[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:32.120]   Lisa follows me.
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.120]   I message at least does.
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:34.120]   Yeah, that's how I keep up with you.
[02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:35.120]   Yeah.
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.120]   Every once in a while.
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:37.120]   Okay.
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.120]   I'm watching.
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:41.080]   So this is not a reflection on her.
[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:45.240]   But I quit Instagram and Facebook so I don't have to see that stuff.
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:47.400]   But she's on her phone and she goes, "Oh, look.
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:48.400]   She is doing this."
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:53.080]   Like, "This is why I'm not on Instagram and Facebook."
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:54.920]   But honey, I love that about you.
[02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:56.360]   She keeps you up to date.
[02:06:56.360 --> 02:07:01.320]   She shows me the funny cat videos.
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.320]   This is the final time.
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:04.240]   So he says, "How many times is this?"
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:06.840]   It's maybe the third or fourth time I've quit Facebook.
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:11.640]   But the last time I went back because of COVID and because I thought I want to stay in touch
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:17.240]   with people, I want to be able to go to my grandma's funeral in bed, stuff like that.
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:21.600]   And I got on there and it was so depressing and grim.
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:24.360]   And I noticed the people around me who are on Facebook, "Don't you have this problem,
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:25.360]   Sheila?"
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:28.640]   "Sheer, I got very upset all the time."
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:29.640]   What would you mean?
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:33.000]   Like you're reading Facebook and now you're upset for the rest of the day.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.680]   My face of followers are pretty...
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:35.680]   They're good.
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:38.000]   I actually have a really good Facebook feed.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.280]   I might say, I know it sounds weird.
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:44.480]   Like I get made fun of by my 26 year old co-host who just jokes around how his mom is on Facebook
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:45.840]   and I'm on Facebook.
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:50.480]   But my community there, if I need something, I post it and I get so many great responses.
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:51.800]   See, every time I tell...
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:54.160]   So the same thing with Twitter for me, I hate it.
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:57.520]   And every time I say that, Stacey says, "You just don't know what you're doing.
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:59.120]   That Twitter's wonderful for me."
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:01.880]   I'm thinking, "That's not the Twitter I know."
[02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:04.240]   You just got to follow a lot fewer people.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:05.240]   See, that's it.
[02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:06.240]   Just...
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:12.480]   I quit Facebook two years ago and haven't looked back and have no intention of ever going
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:13.480]   back.
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:14.480]   I don't miss it.
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.400]   I still have Instagram, but basically I follow Korgies.
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:24.600]   My friends are into cars and a few other close friends and that's it.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:25.600]   What do you think, guys?
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:26.880]   There's no dooms rolling on there.
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:28.520]   I don't see any dooms stuff on Instagram.
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:31.920]   Can you tell him that that's not a Korgie behind him?
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:32.920]   What?
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:33.920]   Oh.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:35.520]   You see, you love Korgies.
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:36.520]   That's a Korgie?
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:37.520]   No, that's not.
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:38.520]   Yeah.
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:39.520]   Yeah.
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:40.520]   That's a pebble.
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:41.520]   Is that one of those tall Korgies?
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:42.520]   It's a...
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:43.520]   No.
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:44.520]   See the short little legs?
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:45.520]   Yeah, I guess.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:46.520]   Okay.
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:47.520]   We couldn't see the legs.
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:48.520]   Dazes a Korgie.
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:49.520]   Okay.
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:50.520]   Okay, good.
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:51.520]   I'm sorry.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:53.120]   Oh, you know what?
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:54.120]   I did...
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:55.640]   I macro-dosed earlier today.
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:59.520]   That's my pre-order.
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:04.760]   Korgies kind of facing some headwinds right now, although Mark Zuckerberg apparently told
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.280]   the staff, "Don't worry, they'll be back.
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:09.640]   Advertisers quitting."
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:12.600]   There's a fairly elaborate Facebook boycott, but you know what?
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:18.400]   I think Mark probably wasn't prudent or politic of him to say that, but I have a feeling
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:19.720]   he's right.
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:26.560]   It's very convenient during summer, during COVID that Pepsi and Unilever and a bunch
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.040]   of advertisers boycott Facebook.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:34.000]   They say till the end of summer or the end of the year, they'll be back.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:41.600]   The North Face REI, Patagonia, the Verizon, Hershey, Honda, Starbucks, Levi's, Diagio,
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:44.640]   but they only represent the top 10 percent, right?
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:45.640]   Diagio.
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:46.640]   Diagio, sorry.
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:47.640]   Diagio.
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:48.640]   What is that?
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:49.640]   It's an ad agency.
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:50.640]   Oh, Diagio.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:51.640]   Right?
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:52.640]   No, no, not ad agency.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:53.640]   They own...
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:54.640]   I need to look it up, but I...
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:56.840]   Oh, you can say it, but you don't know what they are.
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:57.840]   No.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:00.040]   It's a producer of beer and spirits.
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:01.040]   Yeah, beer and spirits.
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:02.540]   Yeah, they own...
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:06.040]   British multinational beverage alcohol company.
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:08.560]   They own a ton of alcohol brands.
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:09.560]   Yeah.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.560]   Bacardi.
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:11.560]   Oh, that's A.O. Bacardi?
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:12.560]   Let me see.
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:13.560]   I need to look at this.
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:14.560]   I'm sorry.
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:15.560]   Do not take anything.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:16.560]   Guinness?
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:17.560]   Guinness?
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:18.560]   Yeah.
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:19.560]   He has the danger.
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:20.560]   Yeah.
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.560]   Sorry, go ahead, Leo.
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:22.560]   I want to just try this.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:25.760]   They have an AI whiskey selector.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.760]   What's your whiskey?
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:34.520]   Now, I can do this because I'm over 21, but if you're watching this and you are not over
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.920]   21, you should stop right now, right?
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:38.720]   Is that right?
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:39.720]   How does that work?
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:40.720]   What is the law there?
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:41.720]   Smearing off, Dan.
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:42.720]   Smearing off.
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:43.720]   Guinness.
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:45.480]   I like that on a bagel.
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:46.480]   Anyway.
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.480]   All right.
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:50.920]   Now, I'm following the Diagio rat hole.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:51.920]   Okay.
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.800]   What's your whiskey?
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:54.800]   Do you like...
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:55.800]   It's called de-scrolling.
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:56.800]   Yeah.
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:57.800]   Smoked foods.
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:59.800]   Oh my God.
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:00.800]   Yeah.
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:01.800]   No.
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:02.800]   Yeah.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:03.800]   No, I love smoked foods.
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:05.640]   So maybe a smoky whiskey.
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:06.680]   Do you like chilies?
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.680]   I love chilies.
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:10.000]   I'm going to say yes to everything.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.720]   See what I get.
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:13.720]   Strong start.
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:14.720]   Strong start.
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:16.080]   Making you want a drink.
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:18.360]   This is what's your whiskey.com.
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:20.400]   Do you like cinnamon apple pie?
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:21.400]   Cheryl is our...
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:22.400]   I like that.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:23.400]   Sure who doesn't.
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:24.400]   Sounds great.
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:26.600]   Do you like dried apricots?
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:27.600]   Mmm.
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:28.600]   No.
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:30.240]   It kind of freaked me out.
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:33.080]   What do you freak you out?
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:34.080]   Like they're out to get you?
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:38.360]   Makes me remind you no offense of like when I had like issues going to the bathroom when
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.360]   I was younger.
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:40.360]   Okay.
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:41.360]   I don't want to talk about it.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.760]   I'm halfway there.
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:43.760]   I'm getting there.
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:44.960]   I liked so far.
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:45.960]   I love fresh ginger.
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:47.200]   Who doesn't love fresh ginger?
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:48.200]   Oh yeah.
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.200]   Fresh ginger.
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:50.200]   I'm loving everything.
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:51.200]   How often I'm not even about it.
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:53.280]   I'm eating one right now.
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:54.280]   Okay.
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:56.560]   Fancy scoop of vanilla ice cream.
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:58.560]   Who would say no to any of this?
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:00.440]   How many things are they making you go through?
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:01.880]   This is taking way too long.
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:02.880]   Okay.
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:03.880]   Well, we can edit it out.
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:05.640]   Do you like pina coladas?
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:06.640]   Oh yeah.
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:08.360]   How about getting lost in the ring?
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:09.360]   I'm not hungry now.
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:10.880]   You know what I've been really into?
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:12.280]   Micheladas like the beer.
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:13.280]   What's that?
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:17.720]   And I'll show you actually while you're doing this, I'll bring out by Michelada.
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:19.240]   Okay.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:24.960]   After saying I love everything, they're recommending, oh, a 12-year-old Lago Vulin.
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:25.960]   Sure.
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:28.760]   Apparently, I'm right smack dab in the middle.
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:31.000]   91% match right there.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.120]   Woody dried fruits burning.
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:35.760]   That's my flavor print.
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.720]   Share that on social media.
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:40.480]   Here's my flavor print.
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:42.240]   Talisker, Lago Vulin.
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:45.280]   They apparently they own everything this company does.
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:47.320]   All right.
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:48.320]   Sorry about that.
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.000]   Didn't mean to take you down that alley.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.480]   So what do you, what's that?
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:52.480]   Oh, Bo Dello.
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:57.040]   Your hand is kind of messed up, but it has tomato, salt and lime in it.
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:59.920]   Oh, that you shouldn't drink that.
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:01.560]   Now it's really good.
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:02.560]   Geez.
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:05.000]   Are you going to smash it on your forehead after you're done?
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.760]   I want to see that.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:08.680]   Please.
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:13.120]   So what do you think of my premise that brick and mortar stores will be like this, Sam
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:14.120]   Ebleseman?
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:16.640]   Oh, there's a core gee.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:17.640]   Okay.
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:19.840]   Next to a Burmese mountain dog.
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:20.840]   Sure.
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:21.840]   Right for scale.
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:23.840]   Let's see how small it looks.
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:24.840]   Sure.
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:25.840]   Okay.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.880]   She looks much smaller with the Burmese mountain dog than she did with your, with your paddle
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:31.880]   work.
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:32.880]   Yeah.
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:38.520]   So, no, I, I, I think, you know, a lot of, I think what we'll see is a scaling back of
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:42.960]   a lot of the, say, full service stores, the kinds of stores that we can, you know, traditional
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:47.000]   stores, you know, some, you know, some of those will remain, you know, as places where
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000]   you can go to check out products in person.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.640]   And, you know, a lot of them will shift towards this, you know, this model of basically a
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:59.480]   drive up warehouse, you know, where you, you show up and they put stuff in your trunk.
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:02.960]   And it's, it's, I think it's one way that brick and mortar can compete against Amazon
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.680]   because at least you can get it today.
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:08.280]   That's no wonder Amazon's working on ways to do that.
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.680]   And, and, you know, the other thing is we're going to start to see, you know, before,
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:16.120]   long before we see rubber taxis, we're going to, we're going to see, you know, autonomous
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:19.960]   vehicles used for deliveries, you know, used for, you know, same days.
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:23.600]   You know, two hour deliveries, you know, so you don't even have to go there.
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:27.360]   It'll just go from, you know, a warehouse and come right to you.
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:29.280]   So I guess we were headed that way anyway.
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:32.840]   It's just that the quarantine has sped some of this stuff up, right, Jason?
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:33.840]   Yeah.
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:34.840]   Yeah.
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:35.840]   Yeah.
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:37.480]   It just accelerated these trends that were already happening in retail.
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:40.680]   And I think we knew things we knew were going to happen.
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:45.800]   The challenges, the challenges with it, speed and things up is there, there was going to
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:52.160]   be, I think, some natural transition points for this, right?
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:56.680]   Because there are parts of the retail experience that we don't want to give up.
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.640]   And we've been slowly kind of figuring that out.
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:04.840]   And it enabled, it has enabled some companies to stay in business as they're figuring it
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:05.840]   out.
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:09.480]   I think the challenge is this is going to be such a shock to the system, right, that
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:17.520]   it is moving more business, transferring more business to Amazon, right?
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:22.520]   And so putting more stress on some of those traditional retailers.
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:28.960]   And so as a result, as consumers, you know, that could, it could give us fewer choices.
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:33.160]   And it could provide, you know, some challenges that we're not necessarily going to have the
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:38.320]   opportunity to start to think of, you know, our buying habits in terms of, okay, here's
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:39.880]   how I want this.
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:43.040]   And here I want to be able to go and try on some of these things.
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:47.040]   And then either have them shipped to me or, you know, pick them up at another store or,
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.560]   you know, delivered locally, you know, next day or those kinds of things.
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.480]   So that's what I worry.
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:57.680]   I like going to the store and looking at shirts and touching the fabrics and stuff.
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:15:59.920]   We'll see if I like my internet suit.
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:04.680]   But I feel like, well, for one thing, I'm not going to go to a store and touch fabrics
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:05.680]   now.
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:06.680]   Right now.
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:07.680]   Yeah.
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:12.680]   I wonder if the experience of the internet suit will be that, oh, you know what?
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:13.680]   This worked great.
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:15.320]   I didn't need to touch that fabric.
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:16.320]   It's good enough.
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:17.320]   Yeah.
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:18.320]   You're going to get used to it.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:20.600]   And I think that once you find one brand you really like, you're just going to stick
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:21.600]   with that brand.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:22.600]   They're going to know your measurements.
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:23.600]   Exactly.
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:27.240]   You can use, can you use LIDAR also to figure out like how big you are everywhere?
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:28.240]   Like 3D.
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:29.240]   I asked Taylor's story about that.
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:30.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:31.240]   You could, but they don't need to.
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.520]   It turns out all they need is two pictures.
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:34.520]   You're height and weight.
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:38.120]   But statistically, they pretty much can get the shirts perfect.
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:39.200]   We'll see how the suit is.
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:41.760]   They do send you, and I think I'm going to wear it.
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:45.640]   They do send you a white canvas scissor suit first.
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:47.320]   So you could put that on.
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:52.640]   But I think that's like I'm getting two suits for the price of one.
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:53.640]   You're going to wear that.
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:55.040]   You don't have to send it back.
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:56.920]   It's going to be my, no, no, it's yours.
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:57.920]   Yours to keep.
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:16:58.920]   It's my zoom suit.
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:16:59.920]   There you go.
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:05.560]   Someone wrote in the comments like small businesses.
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:08.320]   I do think there's going to be a movement to people that don't want to support the
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:13.000]   Amazon's just like people who want to support Facebook and that want to go local.
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.360]   And that also people that are environmentally friendly, that don't want transportation,
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:20.720]   that want to just minimize all of that.
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:23.560]   Oh, that's very tweet and very artisanal.
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:28.560]   And it'll be around, but it's going to be a small fraction of the overall business.
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:37.080]   Well, during this period, we've been consciously trying to do more business with locally owned
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:43.760]   businesses, whether it's restaurants, getting takeout where we can, or local hardware stores
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:50.040]   opposed to going over to Home Depot or Lowe's whenever I can, the stuff that I know that
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:51.080]   they're going to have there.
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:53.360]   And that's the challenges.
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:59.040]   They, you know, a small locally owned hardware store is never going to have all of the stuff
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:03.400]   that I would necessarily need to get from a Lowe's or Home Depot.
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:07.640]   But you know, when the stuff I'm confident that they will have there, I'll go over there
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:09.160]   and get it instead.
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:11.680]   It's a social experience to go to the hardware store.
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:12.680]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:14.680]   Yeah, that's what I do all the time.
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:15.680]   No, no.
[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:16.680]   Well, sure.
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:20.440]   You know, for, so they always say guys don't like shopping.
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:21.800]   We don't like shopping to close.
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:24.200]   But if you want me to go to the hardware store, I'm in.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:26.440]   I'll go because this is so you go.
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:28.080]   So what do you think?
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:32.040]   You think you want a 32-bit auger for that drill or maybe something a little smaller and
[02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:34.840]   they go, oh, yeah, well, you know, let me tell you, what are you going to be hanging
[02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:35.840]   there?
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:40.900]   It depends because you might need a twist clasp to insert on that and then it's spring
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:42.000]   loaded.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.240]   And then you go, oh, well, in that thing, I think that's kind of for guys anyway.
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:50.240]   And so, no, I think that's a bit, it's also women like there's a huge G.I.Y. movement.
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:51.240]   Yeah.
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:54.280]   I just don't do that myself.
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:57.840]   But like I would love to do more of that.
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:00.520]   It's not my jam.
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:01.520]   My favorite.
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:04.680]   Do you know the Instagram account called miserable men?
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:08.080]   No, it sounds like I really wanted.
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.560]   And department stores waiting for their wives.
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:12.560]   Nailed it.
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:13.560]   Oh, my God.
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:17.960]   I thought I was going to be men that are taking pictures of their wives or girlfriends,
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:18.960]   like Instagram husbands.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:19.960]   No.
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:27.720]   It's guys who are stuck in the chair and a man chair, the man chair while they're while
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:29.120]   their wives shop.
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:31.240]   This is, oh, this is a new thing.
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:32.240]   This is the wrong one, maybe.
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:34.080]   That's one of the many reasons I love my wife.
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.480]   She's never made me do that.
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:38.160]   This is not the real miserable man.
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:40.920]   This is only got to.
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:41.920]   They're sleeping.
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:42.920]   Oh, this is so funny.
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:43.920]   Yeah.
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:46.720]   It's miserable underscore men.
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:57.400]   And there's just, this is our experience going shopping with you just so you know.
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:00.320]   That's so sad.
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:03.920]   But take us to a hard first store.
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:08.960]   And we'll, this guy, he fell, oh, see, I did not go let me because I don't have it.
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:10.680]   I don't have any.
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:11.680]   I know.
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:12.680]   It's so sad.
[02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:16.280]   He fell asleep in the china, should try this section.
[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:25.080]   Anyway, let me, all right, let me take one more break because I do, I know it's dinner
[02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:28.200]   time and she's about to pass out.
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:30.200]   So, so she's.
[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:32.040]   So what are you going to have for what's for dinner?
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:33.040]   You're going to go down and get.
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:34.040]   Oh my God.
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:37.080]   I was going to go and get some actually like veggie burger.
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:38.080]   Yes.
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:39.080]   Of some sort.
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:41.800]   And although our barbecue isn't working.
[02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:42.800]   Oh no.
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:43.800]   I have a few extra.
[02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:45.800]   I can say you're one.
[02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:52.680]   So, and I still work to do still tonight, but I am hungry.
[02:20:52.680 --> 02:20:54.840]   So I'm going to wrap this up.
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:57.480]   First let me tell you about a great sponsor wasabi.
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:01.000]   This will get you hungrier and I'm not talking about the little green ball of hot stuff they
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000]   put next to sushi.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.160]   Although that would be delicious right about now.
[02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:05.720]   I'm talking about something else.
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:11.480]   Hot cloud storage wasabi founded by a good friend of mine, David friend is a serial entrepreneur,
[02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:13.480]   brilliant guy.
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:20.000]   He and his partner came up with a way to write data on a disc sequentially as opposed to
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:26.840]   in sectors that is much faster and much more efficient.
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:29.920]   And as a result, they he started carbonite because of that.
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:31.080]   Now he started wasabi.
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:32.080]   It's cloud storage.
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:35.280]   He's learned a lot about cloud storage over the years.
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:41.720]   Turns out there are a lot of people, modern times people who are creating a lot of data.
[02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:42.880]   David told me about this.
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:43.880]   He's in Boston.
[02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:44.880]   Wasabi's in Boston.
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:50.520]   There's this Boston high rise where they put in security cameras as one does.
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:53.960]   But what they realized is those security cameras are spitting out like a terabyte or two of
[02:21:53.960 --> 02:22:01.680]   data every day, day after day, after day after day, and they were buying a lot of on-premises
[02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:05.280]   storage like a lot of it.
[02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:07.440]   And when they found out about wasabi, they said, "Wait a minute.
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:11.840]   You mean we could buy cloud storage, kind of an infinite amount of cloud storage for
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:14.480]   less than the cost of our on-prem?"
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:19.280]   In fact, it's actually significantly cheaper than on-premises storage.
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:26.120]   It's about the cost of the maintenance fees for the on-prem storage alone, not including
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:27.120]   the hardware.
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:31.240]   80% less expensive than Amazon's S3.
[02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:34.440]   But so much better, faster.
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:36.400]   It's a disruptive price performance model.
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:41.080]   It just makes cloud storage a natural addition to what you're doing.
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:42.800]   The cloud is there.
[02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:44.560]   Take advantage of it.
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:48.440]   It's a great deal if you're a managed service provider, if you're reselling storage, because
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:52.680]   you can earn more while charging less because wasabi's so much less expensive.
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:55.400]   But let me, when I say that, I want to tell you about some of the benefits.
[02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:56.560]   You're not giving up anything.
[02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:59.200]   It's more secure than on-prem's storage.
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:05.240]   They host your data and premier tier four data centers, highly secure and fully redundant.
[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:08.040]   They do active integrity check.
[02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:12.800]   And every object stored is checked for integrity every 90 days.
[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:17.080]   They're offering 11 nines of durability, so much more than an on-premises hard drive
[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:18.360]   can do.
[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:22.480]   On average, you'd lose one file every 649,000 years.
[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:25.080]   They also are secure.
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:30.280]   Every bit of data is encrypted at rest, even if you don't request encryption.
[02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:34.720]   They follow all the industry best security models and design practices like access control
[02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:38.240]   mechanisms, bucket policies, access control lists.
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:41.960]   My favorite feature I use all the time, your data is immutable.
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:46.440]   You can say, nobody can mess with this data, not ransomware, not a fumble fingered employee,
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:48.600]   not even me.
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:50.360]   Protects your data from being a racer altered.
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:51.960]   So it's super secure.
[02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:56.120]   That's why it's FINRA compliant, HIPAA compliant, CJIS compliant.
[02:23:56.120 --> 02:23:58.480]   Now, it's also very affordable.
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:01.280]   Flat rate, $5.99 per terabyte per month.
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:02.760]   You do not pay for egress.
[02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:06.080]   That's another thing that bites me with S3 every time.
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:08.600]   As soon as I want my data back, I have to pay for it.
[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:11.200]   You do not pay for egress with a sobby.
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:15.840]   They have the same API as Amazon's S3, but they don't charge for API requests.
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.800]   So you can use all your S3 software, but it's less expensive to use it.
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:21.760]   And they don't have those fancy, complex storage tiers.
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:23.240]   It's just a flat rate.
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:25.720]   Although they do have another way to pay, they just added, which I love.
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:27.960]   It's called reserved capacity storage.
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:31.920]   And this is specifically for like that high rise in Boston that knows we're going to have
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:34.920]   four terabytes a day forever.
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:38.400]   You can buy cloud storage upfront.
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:42.320]   So if you're thinking about buying more hardware storage, compare the price against, let's say,
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:44.400]   five years of reserved capacity storage.
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:47.600]   You can actually purchase it in one, three, or five-year increments.
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:51.600]   The discounts go up the more you buy and for the longer the term.
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:53.080]   So you're going to get great discounts.
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:54.440]   You're going to save a ton of money.
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:56.040]   You're going to have reserved capacity.
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:57.680]   You just know.
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:01.160]   I don't know why more people aren't using wasabi.
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:04.360]   Everybody knows about Amazon and Google and Microsoft.
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:08.120]   They're the big names, but please do yourself a favor.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:10.480]   Add a fourth name to your shopping list.
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:11.480]   Tell the boss.
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:12.480]   Show the boss the benefits.
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:14.200]   You can try it yourself for a month free.
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:15.200]   Go to wasabi.com.
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:18.840]   Click the free trial link and to the code TWIT.
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:19.920]   Then join the movement.
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:22.160]   Migrate your data to the cloud with confidence.
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:27.440]   I think when you explain the benefits and show the price, it's just a no-brainer with
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:28.920]   sobbe's the greatest.
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.520]   These guys really know what they're doing.
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:34.360]   Next generation cloud storage that's disrupting the industry wasabi.
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:35.360]   W-A-S-A-B-I.com.
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:40.720]   Don't forget to use the offer code TWIT when you do the free trial so that they can know
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:43.720]   that you saw it here.
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:46.120]   Wasabi.com.
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:47.840]   We didn't talk much about the Facebook.
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:48.840]   Uh-oh.
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:52.480]   Jason is wearing some disability.
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:53.480]   You wearing your zoom shirt?
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:54.480]   There.
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:55.480]   He's getting a Michelotta.
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:56.480]   Yeah.
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:58.480]   Man, now I want a Michelotta.
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:25:59.480]   Wow.
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:05.720]   So, it's modello beer with- Well, you could use any beer with either bloody marinade mix
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:08.160]   or tomato, salt, some lemon.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:10.080]   But my roommate got these for me.
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:11.240]   They're really big though.
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:13.240]   Look at- and I actually somehow drink them.
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:14.520]   Oh, I know how you drink them.
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:15.600]   Not like I do one at a time.
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:16.600]   I don't like sprinkle.
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:19.120]   No, I never drink two beers at a time.
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:20.360]   It's too hard.
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:22.360]   You can't- No, not like one out to the other.
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:23.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:26.560]   Meaning like I could only do one of these like that day or night.
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:27.560]   Okay.
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:32.320]   It's better than Budweiser Lime though, right?
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.080]   I mean, I'm not- I'm not typically a beer drinker.
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:35.720]   I would do a corona with lime.
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:36.720]   Like one- Yeah, that's nice.
[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:37.720]   I'm a one beer type of person.
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:38.720]   Yeah, I know.
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:39.720]   I know.
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:40.720]   I know.
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:41.720]   Microsoft, I want to give them a little credit.
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:43.520]   They're doing something really cool.
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:53.120]   They have pledged to quote "upskill" 25 million workers in the COVID economy.
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:54.840]   And they're going to do it by the end of this year.
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:56.560]   So, there are a lot of people out of work.
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:26:58.160]   There are a lot of people unemployed.
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:03.600]   There are a lot of people delivering food or Amazon packages who really could be doing
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:05.160]   a lot better.
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:11.640]   Microsoft has got a really cool free service for you.
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:15.480]   They've identified 10 jobs that are in the most demands today.
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:16.960]   And they've got the training.
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:25.000]   They call them learning paths that you can do online to learn.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.880]   It's part of the GitHub Learning Lab and Microsoft's LinkedIn Learning.
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:31.400]   And I think this is really good.
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:33.320]   They're putting a lot of money into it.
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:39.680]   $20 million in grants to nonprofits.
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:41.120]   These are really great.
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:46.400]   You don't have to have proof that your job is impacted by COVID-19.
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:52.720]   But if you say it has, you'll pay $15 for these exams and classes.
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:53.720]   So which are normally $100.
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:56.800]   Isn't that great?
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:07.200]   I want to see more corporate companies step up to train underemployed people, to help
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:11.200]   black people rise and get better jobs.
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:12.560]   There's just so much companies can do.
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:14.440]   I think Microsoft's really in the forefront of this.
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:15.440]   And I'm really proud of them.
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:16.600]   I think that's great.
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:25.600]   The extent to which those companies, you know, that they take issues of equity and justice
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:30.920]   and make it part of their company's values and not sort of these things that are less
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:37.280]   core to their values and more sort of for corporate social responsibility, which is mostly
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:41.440]   a lot of virtual signaling, unfortunately.
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:46.080]   The more that they're going to have the opportunity to, one, diversify the voices in the company,
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:50.280]   which will help them build better products, you know, study after study has shown.
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:59.400]   But it will also, I think, attract the people that want to support those companies in ways
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:08.000]   that they haven't totally thought about in the past, right, in terms of how they can
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:12.960]   draw more people into their customer base because that's what they're all about.
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:18.280]   They do obviously have to think about continuing to keep the lights on and those types of things.
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:24.000]   But there just hasn't been enough of that from Silicon Valley companies.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.480]   And we started to see the unfortunate negative consequences of it.
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:32.640]   So I'd love to see them turn that around.
[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:34.120]   Sure.
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:36.000]   Are you familiar with I mouth?
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.480]   I know what is that?
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:39.480]   You're not.
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:42.520]   Man, you should start watching what's trending.
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:49.240]   I hear it's a great way to keep up more like social culture and the YouTube start influencer
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:50.240]   world.
[02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:51.240]   Well, okay.
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:54.600]   So this was this was a thing on Twitter.
[02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:58.360]   The eye mouth eye.
[02:29:58.360 --> 02:30:01.240]   It was actually kind of a joke.
[02:30:01.240 --> 02:30:04.320]   Oh, like the, the, okay.
[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:07.080]   You might have seen this on people's Twitters.
[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:08.600]   What was this?
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:09.600]   Was this this week?
[02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:11.480]   Yeah, it was last week.
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:12.480]   Yeah.
[02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:15.960]   It was even Jason didn't know about.
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:16.960]   Yeah.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:23.600]   So the, the idea was a bunch of tech workers started putting the emojis for an eye, a mouth
[02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:31.400]   and an eye in their tweets and start saying cryptic things about this exciting new, implying
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:35.480]   it's like an app, the next hot app.
[02:30:35.480 --> 02:30:42.160]   In the span of two days, they collected 30,000 email addresses for people seeking invitations
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:46.160]   for early access to eye mouth eye.
[02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:50.640]   It was 60, mostly young, mostly non white people working in companies like Facebook,
[02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:55.160]   Instagram, I'm reading from the Wired story about it, Twitter and Stripe.
[02:30:55.160 --> 02:31:00.320]   They created basically an artificial hype cycle.
[02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:09.120]   They dangled a fake public, a private beta, but then raised $200,000 for the Oakrop project,
[02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:11.080]   the Innocence Project, the Loveland Foundation.
[02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:12.080]   I love that.
[02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:13.680]   I don't know why I didn't see, I did not see that.
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:15.720]   Is that wild?
[02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:19.960]   On the other hand, you may love it, but it also, there's people saying that you completely
[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:20.960]   misrepresented.
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:26.040]   Yeah, but then they raised money for a good cause, but they had to say like once they
[02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:29.600]   got you in that it's actually going to this, but yeah, that's it.
[02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:30.600]   Yeah.
[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:31.600]   Yeah.
[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:35.000]   It's great that they, you know, that they tipped the money and gave it to charity, you
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:36.600]   know, all for that.
[02:31:36.600 --> 02:31:40.840]   But you know, the fact that 30,000 people signed up for this thing that they had no idea what
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:41.840]   it's all about.
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:42.840]   It tells you something.
[02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:44.880]   This is exactly what I was talking about earlier with, you know, cheating.
[02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:46.560]   You can slow down.
[02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:49.320]   Don't sign up for every new thing that comes along.
[02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:50.320]   It's not.
[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:54.480]   They created, they created, now it's the websites change, but they created initially
[02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:58.840]   a website that had the eye, mouth and eye just bouncing around and said, give us your
[02:31:58.840 --> 02:31:59.840]   email address.
[02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:00.840]   That's amazing.
[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:04.000]   Now it says donate and submit your receipt to.
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:05.000]   Okay.
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.960]   But that goes back to like Minnesota Freedom Funds.
[02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:10.720]   You know, they raised millions of dollars and people were calling them out because they
[02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:15.440]   only spent, they disclose they only spent like $100,000.
[02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:21.400]   But they also on the site say they do other things, not just, you know, bail out funds.
[02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:23.480]   They also help with immigration and all that.
[02:32:23.480 --> 02:32:24.680]   And people are like, what?
[02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:26.520]   And all you have to do is read the site.
[02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:27.520]   Yeah.
[02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:28.520]   Yeah.
[02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:32.840]   Here's an example, a tweet from @HipCityRidge.
[02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:36.960]   So far the best term sheet has been for at 40 million pre money.
[02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:38.760]   If someone could beat that, let me know.
[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:39.760]   I mouth.
[02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:45.600]   I am implying that they're raising 40 million.
[02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:46.600]   Of course they weren't.
[02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:48.000]   There wasn't anything.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:54.680]   And then another guy completely in on it said, I'm in for 420 at 69 million pre money,
[02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:56.240]   send term sheet.
[02:32:56.240 --> 02:32:59.640]   And I'll double an anchor.
[02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:00.640]   Hit my DMs.
[02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:05.760]   Now, a lot of this is joking around about the crazy Silicon Valley culture.
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:16.840]   They basically, as Wyatt said, monetized FOMO in 36 hours, $200,000 for charity, 30,000
[02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:20.000]   email addresses.
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:24.520]   There were 60 people in the iMouth iGroup chat.
[02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:26.280]   They were already internet acquaintances.
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:27.880]   They quickly started adding to the joke.
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:30.200]   So they kind of made it go viral.
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:31.200]   I think that's pretty wild.
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:32.200]   That's amazing.
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:34.400]   I don't know if it's good or bad.
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:37.640]   It's a statement.
[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:40.320]   It's the reality.
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:42.320]   It's the way it is.
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:47.760]   Well, we live in.
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:50.280]   This is a weird story I saw in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:54.600]   And it's hitting commerce sites of all sizes.
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:34:01.560]   There is somebody going around using the name John Smith and loading up the shopping cart
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:06.320]   and then abandoning it, which you might say is, well, that's just kind of silly.
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:07.920]   Here's the lead from the journal.
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:12.440]   John Smith started shopping early on a recent Wednesday and didn't stop for days.
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:16.880]   He visited an auto supply site where he loaded his cart with a replacement turn signal lever,
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:20.160]   emergency strobe light, and two dozen other items.
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:24.560]   He hopped over to a home goods merchant for another 10 items, including wood, paper,
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:28.400]   picture frames, address plaques, a towel rack, and mailbox.
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:35.080]   He ordered one of every kind of baby bundle ranging from $80 to $500 from a site that sells
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:42.160]   infant sleeping boxes, popular in Finland, and then walked away.
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:48.960]   For more than a year, online merchants have been noticing somebody named John Smith doing
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:53.520]   this, but it's more than a nuisance because it skews the analytics they use to decide
[02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:57.520]   where to advertise and what products to sell.
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:03.280]   He uses bogus email addresses and they find that out because as you know, if you abandon
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:06.760]   a shopping cart, you will get an email saying, hey, you didn't buy it.
[02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:09.960]   Can we give you a 10% discount or something like that?
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:13.960]   And they get those bounced back.
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:16.320]   It's apparently going around.
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:18.600]   Anybody know anything about John Smith?
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:19.600]   Is that you, Jason?
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:20.600]   I think it's you.
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:21.600]   You're doing this.
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:23.280]   No, I don't have that kind of money.
[02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:24.600]   No, he doesn't spend any money.
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:25.600]   I know.
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:26.600]   It's more like time.
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:28.040]   I don't have any of that time.
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:28.960]   How was this even reported?
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:29.960]   Definitely.
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:32.400]   I don't even get how they even found out about this.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:33.480]   It was like random people.
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:34.680]   People probably do this all the time.
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:36.720]   Yeah, but you're bored at home.
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:41.520]   Yeah, but apparently these e-commerce people saying, hey, this guy's driving me nuts and
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:43.960]   eventually is his name, John Smith.
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:44.960]   Yeah.
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:49.160]   Well, I mean, there's these companies that I forget.
[02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:53.200]   There was one, I think it was an ad was either an advertiser on Twitter or on some other shows
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.200]   I was listening to.
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:36:00.560]   They're specialized in helping website operators deal with...
[02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:02.360]   Have a band and shopping cart.
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:04.360]   Yeah, have a band and shopping cart.
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:05.360]   Yeah, for sure.
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:08.160]   Figure out how do you fix your site to keep people to go ahead.
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:09.160]   That's right.
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:16.120]   They may have seen this influx of John Smith abandoned shopping carts across multiple sites
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:18.480]   and started to connect the dots.
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:20.480]   Well...
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:24.960]   I was like an IT guy who was in a cart abandonment division and got fired and is like, you know
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:25.960]   what?
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:26.960]   I'm going to take all these companies.
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:29.520]   I'm going to ruin the data of every big company I can find.
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:31.600]   You're probably controlling all of them.
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:32.600]   Yeah.
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:34.080]   Well, get ready for this.
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:35.080]   It was Google.
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:37.480]   What do you mean?
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:38.480]   Hey.
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:40.480]   It was Google.
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:45.320]   You always use a Gmail address.
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:55.560]   And Google said that we do spot checking on prices with an automated checker.
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:37:02.880]   The mystery spot, the mystery shopper rather, is a bot that Google created.
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:04.720]   Making sure that the all in price for the...
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:08.720]   Because you know sometimes you have to check out to find the price or get the shipping
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:09.720]   or the tags.
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:10.720]   You get the real price.
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:11.720]   Yeah.
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:12.720]   Google says...
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:19.800]   This was an attempt to get the accurate price for its Google shopping platform or in advertisements.
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:21.600]   They're sorry.
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:27.520]   They didn't mean to cause so much consternation or confusion.
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:30.880]   It was a bot that Google created.
[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:31.880]   The mystery spot...
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:35.600]   We aren't always using the price Google didn't create unique names for every time they did
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:36.600]   it instead of...
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:37.600]   They did.
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:38.600]   It was a unique...
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:39.600]   But it was always a Gmail.
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:40.600]   It was.
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:41.600]   Oh, you mean like not John Smith?
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:45.400]   They probably could have done that, huh?
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:47.320]   That was a poorly programmed bot.
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:50.840]   Lulu Lulu, have you ever used a mirror?
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:51.840]   Anybody used a mirror?
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:52.840]   This is another...
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:53.840]   I've seen it.
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:55.600]   This is another business that's big in COVID, right?
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:58.800]   Peloton mirror, all these things where you work at home.
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:02.960]   Last summer my wife and I were in New York for a few days on vacation and we were on
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:05.320]   the subway and I saw an ad for this thing.
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:06.480]   What the hell is that?
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:11.320]   And I looked it up on my phone and we both thought it was the most narcissistic thing
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:12.320]   we'd ever seen.
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:13.560]   It's a big mirror.
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:16.840]   You have a trainer in the mirror prerecorded.
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:18.800]   You work out in front of it.
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:19.800]   It's kind of like...
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:24.480]   I have a Peloton which I love which is basically a spin class via the internet.
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:28.840]   And it monitors all your vitals and stuff like that.
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:31.840]   Well, you might laugh at it.
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:36.760]   Sam, but they just got sold to Lulu Lemon for half a billion dollars.
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:37.760]   Wow.
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:39.560]   It's a $1,500...
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:44.680]   $1,500 reflective display.
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:48.280]   You watch streaming workouts and you watch yourself all at the same time.
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:53.880]   It's perfect for the 20th century, 21st century.
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:39:00.480]   That's like the average price of a home workout machine.
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:03.720]   So I see what they're doing, right?
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:04.720]   Yeah.
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:08.760]   We finally quit the gym because our gym just reopened.
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:10.520]   They were not making you wear masks.
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:13.680]   I think that seems like a recipe for disaster.
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:19.160]   Oh, let's all get together, huff and puff and see what happens.
[02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:20.160]   So we just quit the gym.
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:21.360]   I have a Peloton bike.
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:23.640]   It's probably the same cost as a year gym membership.
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:26.480]   It's not cheap, but it's roughly the same.
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:33.080]   And I just, whenever I want, which means I never use it, I go into the gym and bicycle.
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:34.720]   Are you losing weight?
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:38.080]   I have some friends that have really kept in shape using the Peloton.
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:42.080]   Yeah, no, I've gained weight on the Peloton because I never use it.
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:44.080]   Because you eat your pizza in the morning on the Peloton.
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:49.200]   I eat my pizza in the morning instead of going in Pelotonting.
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:50.120]   Yeah.
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:54.360]   I gained the COVID-19, John saying.
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:55.520]   We don't want to shame here.
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:56.360]   No shame, mate.
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:57.360]   No shame.
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:39:59.120]   No body shaming.
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:05.840]   There's actually a new gym that opened up about a mile from us two weeks before the shutdown started.
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:07.240]   Oh, bad timing.
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:09.880]   My wife had been waiting for it to open up.
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:12.080]   My wife was thinking about joining.
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:18.560]   And fortunately, she didn't go sign up in advance because now there's a good probability
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:20.480]   that it's never going to reopen.
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:27.960]   I feel bad for the Broadway shows that opened a week before quarantine.
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:31.400]   And now Broadway's announced to close the rest of the year.
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:33.240]   Yeah, probably through March.
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:34.240]   Yeah.
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:35.240]   Yeah.
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:38.040]   Yes, Cirque du Soleil, who owns Blue Man Group.
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:40.240]   They've fired all the people from Blue Man Group.
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:42.040]   They just declared bankruptcy.
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:43.040]   Yeah.
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:44.040]   Yeah.
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:45.960]   They were already in trouble.
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:48.680]   So it's one of the, I think they got bought private equity.
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:52.680]   So we've seen this with a number of businesses, especially retail, that were already struggling,
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:53.680]   right?
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:54.680]   This is one of those things.
[02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:59.280]   It's just, again, accelerating some trends and people that thought they had more runway
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:05.200]   to kind of figure something out and morph their business or find a way to get them.
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:08.080]   And find where they had a path forward.
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:11.040]   It's just kind of evaporating for them right now, sadly.
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:15.840]   The lot of retail, a lot of big retail is also going out of business because they do
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:19.600]   these leveraged buyouts, which means they have no runway at all.
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:25.120]   And any economic disaster, especially one that lasts a few months, that's it.
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:26.120]   It's such crap.
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:30.040]   And it should be better regulated because in that case, there's so many businesses that
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:31.440]   are actually solid businesses.
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:37.160]   Things like Toys R Us and others that are solid business, and it's just so badly regulated
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:41.960]   that the companies go in there, these really parasitic companies buy them.
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:47.680]   And then they carve out their most valuable assets, which is sometimes their real estate
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:48.960]   and that kind of thing.
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:56.560]   And then they make the company rent real estate from them, the company that they use to own.
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.080]   The private equity firm.
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:41:59.520]   Exactly the private equity firm.
[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:00.520]   Thank you.
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:05.960]   And then when the company sort of hits a bad bump in the road, they just like, great, they
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:07.320]   get rid of them and all the workers.
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:11.080]   And then they keep the most valuable assets for themselves, all kind of stuff like that.
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:12.320]   It's just really dirty.
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:16.360]   So are there going to be a lot of blue people in the unemployment line?
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:22.800]   I mean, if you're a contortionist or a trapeze artist, I mean, what do you mean?
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:29.920]   I mean, I mean, yeah, I mean, LA, like half of LA is unemployed, performers, actors, the
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:30.920]   industry.
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:31.920]   So sad.
[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:32.920]   Yeah, it's really challenging.
[02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:38.080]   I feel for, you know, all the restaurants in town are trying as best they can, but you
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:42.160]   know, they're not hiring servers or cooks, you know, those that are doing takeout, I guess,
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:47.480]   have cooks, but they say we can't make enough money and take out to just keep a staff.
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:48.480]   It's very tough.
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:52.840]   The hope when I see that is like those people who probably had other passions or things they
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:56.120]   want, they'll double down and those things are get creative and then they'll look back.
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:01.840]   I mean, my hope is this is, you know, me being optimistic, but in glass half full, like they'll
[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:05.360]   look back and say, Oh, if this hadn't happened, I wouldn't have pursued this.
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:08.040]   We will survive it, but it is not going to be fun.
[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:10.520]   It is going to be very painful for a lot of you.
[02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:16.200]   We're going to have a recession that's going to last a long time because so many of the,
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:20.960]   you know, so many of the businesses that had to close during this period are never going
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:21.960]   to reopen.
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:29.160]   It's probably half or more of small and medium businesses that closed will never reopen.
[02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:33.920]   And you know, something else will pop up eventually, but you know, that's going to put a lot of
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:37.120]   people out of out of work for a long time.
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:38.120]   It's tough.
[02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:44.160]   I mean, you know, they always said, Oh, you should have a reserve cash reserve equivalent
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:48.560]   to three months salary or a business should always have six months cash reserve.
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:52.560]   But as a small business person, I know that's easier said than done.
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:53.560]   It's not.
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:54.560]   Yeah, it's not realistic.
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:56.560]   And then the whole, oh, it's sorry.
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:57.560]   Go ahead, sure.
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:43:58.560]   I was it.
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:43:59.560]   Yeah.
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:04.080]   He was just saying most of the things that, you know, the government saying that people
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:06.960]   are seeing on unemployment because it's more than what they're making.
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:07.960]   All right.
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:11.880]   So, and I think I mentioned this on this show even like then the big thing is wire wages
[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:12.880]   so low.
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:14.400]   Yeah, they're lower than unemployment.
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:17.960]   It's showing a lot of fractures in our system.
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:19.840]   Yes, a lot of them.
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:24.040]   Well, especially, you know, the restaurant industry, you know, where so many people that
[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:28.760]   work in restaurants, you know, you think of minimum wage being, you know, seven, eight,
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:32.880]   nine, $10 an hour, but that doesn't apply to most restaurant workers.
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:33.880]   Right.
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:38.720]   A lot of restaurant workers, they have a separate minimum wage in most places that is
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:43.040]   like two between two and two 50 an hour, you know, because they assume they're going
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:44.040]   to get tips.
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:45.040]   Yep.
[02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:50.480]   And, you know, if you're, if all your, you know, if your restaurant is open just for
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:55.440]   takeout, you know, you're, you're probably not getting anywhere near those kinds of
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:44:57.400]   tips if you're working at all.
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:44:58.400]   Yeah.
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:01.600]   Alcohol, restaurants get out of the town of money from the alcohol.
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:05.320]   Thank goodness Kanye is going to be our next president because he's going to make it
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:07.080]   all work.
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:12.240]   Uh, so let's wrap up.
[02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:16.800]   How many, uh, how many times have you watched Hamilton in the last 48 hours?
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:19.200]   Once once one and a half.
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:20.800]   I watched Disney plus.
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:23.000]   Oh, it's worth getting Disney plus just for him.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:24.200]   I just got it for this.
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:25.200]   Yeah.
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:27.600]   Cause no, no free trial for you.
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:30.320]   Seven bucks a month, but it is amazing.
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:32.920]   I know Jason, you're a big Hamilton fan.
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:35.520]   You still have the poster behind you.
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:36.520]   I did.
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:37.520]   I did.
[02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:42.200]   Um, so I, I hate to like admit this cause it's, I, but I did see it.
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:52.200]   I, I mean, it was the most, um, it was the most powerful like experience I'd had.
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:55.720]   And really just artistic experience being in the audience.
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:45:59.720]   And I really, I really thought that it was going to be hard.
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:02.480]   I was looking forward to the movie, but I thought it's going to be hard.
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:05.360]   Live theater is such a powerful thing, right?
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:09.560]   That's why you can only do it 1300 people at a time because you really do sort of as
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:13.640]   an audience member feel like you, you sort of have this relationship with the people,
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:16.280]   you know, um, uh, on the stage.
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:22.640]   But um, but they did, they did really terrific job of filming this because it, um, I got
[02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:23.640]   things out of it.
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:26.520]   I didn't get, you know, being in the audience.
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:32.240]   And I, I, I thought that it was one of the, uh, one of the most powerful things that I'd
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:37.280]   seen being in the audience, but as a movie, it was actually one of the most enjoyable things
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:44.000]   that I had seen it certainly for live theater on, um, film, which is a really hard thing
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.240]   to do and almost never goes well.
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:50.280]   I thought it was maybe one of, if not the best version that I'd seen.
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:51.840]   Um, so they, they did it well.
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:52.840]   They did it right.
[02:46:52.840 --> 02:47:01.320]   When we saw it in New York, I took, uh, Lisa and Michael and, uh, it was amazing.
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:04.400]   We saw it three months before the movie was filmed.
[02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:10.720]   But I have to say I couldn't cry as loudly as I did last yesterday on the couch.
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:15.840]   I was bawling my eyes out from beginning to end in the beginning of joy because it's
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:17.920]   such a great work of art.
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:22.680]   It is per head is one of the greatest works of art of all time and to have it preserved
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:25.640]   on film, I'm so, so grateful.
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:29.640]   Um, and then of course because it's terrifically sad.
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:35.360]   Uh, so I'm happy for the first act and then I'm just bawling my eyes out for the last act.
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:38.040]   So, um, that was really, really good.
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:42.080]   I've only watched it once, uh, but I'll be watching it again many, many times, I'm sure
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:43.560]   because it's so good away.
[02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:47.200]   We've seen it in New York and San Francisco, but I have to say you're right, Jason.
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:52.400]   I think they did a brilliant job of putting it on a film.
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:54.040]   Very challenging thing to do, but they, they, they,
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:55.040]   it is.
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:56.200]   I was concerned about that.
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:01.920]   And I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was, uh, on film and how much it replicated,
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:05.280]   but not only that added to some things that I didn't get.
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:09.920]   There's so much going on in the, in the, on stage at all times that you miss a lot of
[02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:13.800]   it unless you watch it, uh, like several times, I think.
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:15.200]   Um, yeah.
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:16.800]   Although we were close enough.
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:21.200]   I think King George comes on, Jonathan Groff was brilliant and we were close enough
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:23.560]   when we saw in New York that he spit on us.
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:24.560]   No way.
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:25.560]   Really?
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:26.960]   It's a very wet performance.
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:30.800]   And I realized now, and I didn't realize it at this time, he's playing King George's
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:37.160]   kind of off his rocker a little bit like he's like, you know, and, uh, and I thought, well,
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:41.240]   he be as wet in this movie as he was in the theater and he was.
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:42.800]   He actually, he just spit.
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:43.800]   Yeah.
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:48.440]   So it reaffirmed my, uh, my memory of the, of the event.
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:49.440]   Yes, battle.
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:51.280]   It's so great to see you guys.
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:55.880]   It's so wonderful to have some time together with good friends and, and have some fun.
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:57.880]   And I hope I didn't offend anybody.
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:01.240]   Uh, we took a few side trips here and there, but, uh,
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:04.800]   Oh, it's too bad there was no news to talk about.
[02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:05.800]   Yeah.
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:10.080]   Believe it or not, that's a no news show.
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:11.240]   That Sam Ebel's salmon.
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:13.360]   He joins me on the radio show every Sunday.
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:16.960]   We didn't do it this week because we took the 4th of July weekend off, but you'll be
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:18.480]   back next Sunday.
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:21.520]   And of course he's got a great podcast of his own called wheel bearings.
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:23.560]   You'll find it at wheel bearings.media.
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:29.360]   He's also a principal analyst at guidehouse insights.com and he's my car guy.
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:30.720]   Couldn't do it without you.
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:31.720]   Great.
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:32.720]   Always to talk.
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:34.840]   We didn't get to talk about what we talked about on the radio show and I meant to, but
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:36.040]   we ran out of time.
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:38.720]   The amazing processor in the new Ford F one 50.
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:40.520]   We'll talk about that another time.
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:41.520]   There's some.
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:42.520]   Yeah.
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:43.520]   Actually that's not in the F one 50.
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:44.920]   That one's coming to new Mercedes cars.
[02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:45.920]   Oh, that's the Mercedes.
[02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:47.120]   Oh, it's got the Ford's using.
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:48.120]   Yeah.
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:49.120]   The orange video, the orange.
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:50.120]   The rest of the year.
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:51.120]   Yeah.
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:52.120]   Yeah.
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:53.120]   That's that's still a couple of years from production.
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:54.120]   Okay.
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:55.120]   Oh, good.
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:56.120]   We got time next time we're on.
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:49:57.120]   We'll talk about it.
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:58.120]   Fascinating.
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:49:59.120]   Fascinating.
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:01.840]   And BMW selling heated car seats as a subscription.
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:04.440]   Yeah, that kind of blew me away.
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:08.200]   First they wanted to charge for Apple the car play.
[02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:15.280]   Now if you want to keep your car seats heating, they had a VR, they had a VR press event.
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:16.280]   Have that?
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:17.280]   Was that cool?
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:18.880]   No, not really.
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:25.480]   They sent out Oculus Go headsets to everybody to use and we're supposed to send them back
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:28.000]   as soon as they tell us where to send them to.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:35.000]   But there was there was nothing that they did in this VR presentation that wouldn't have
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.080]   been pretty much the same thing.
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:44.440]   Just on a flat screen, you know, in a, you know, in a Webax or zoom presentation.
[02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:50.000]   And you know, it was worse because wearing, you know, wearing a set of VR goggles, I couldn't
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.000]   take notes.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.200]   I couldn't record what was going on.
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:53.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:54.200]   That's true.
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:57.640]   So, you know, as a media event, it made no sense at all.
[02:50:57.640 --> 02:51:02.560]   And you know, I've talked to them and they said they'll probably never do that again.
[02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:04.880]   It was, you know, they tried something.
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:07.360]   It didn't work, you know.
[02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:11.120]   So, but yeah, their cars are all now.
[02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:15.840]   They all have all their new cars have over the air update capability like Tesla does and
[02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:18.560]   a lot of other manufacturers are going that direction.
[02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:23.720]   And they're looking at new business models for, you know, to allow customers to pay for
[02:51:23.720 --> 02:51:27.080]   stuff, you know, if they don't want it all the time, you know, if you only want to pay
[02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:30.120]   for your heated seats in the winter time and not pay for it in the summertime.
[02:51:30.120 --> 02:51:31.120]   It's crazy.
[02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:35.200]   They're not, they're going to adapt that to different markets.
[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:39.280]   So, you know, in the U.S. they're probably not going to do that.
[02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:43.880]   They're going to experiment with it and see how the idea would be instead of paying for
[02:51:43.880 --> 02:51:46.840]   it up front, you pay for it as you go.
[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:47.840]   Exactly.
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:49.240]   This is basically an app purchase.
[02:51:49.240 --> 02:51:50.240]   Yeah.
[02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:54.440]   And then what if I'm just like one day, have someone in my car and like, oh, my ass is
[02:51:54.440 --> 02:51:55.440]   cold.
[02:51:55.440 --> 02:51:56.440]   I want it.
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:57.440]   Oh, I need to go in.
[02:51:57.440 --> 02:51:58.440]   You got to call them up.
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:00.240]   Just, well, no, you just go on the screen and, you know, turn it up.
[02:52:00.240 --> 02:52:02.360]   You know, okay, I want my heated seats on now.
[02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:05.000]   See, it's on demand heated, but yeah.
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:09.520]   They've got to take some chances because they're getting that O.D.H.P.
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:10.520]   It's good.
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:13.720]   They're getting crushed by Tesla in that part of the market.
[02:52:13.720 --> 02:52:20.040]   They are going to be the first to use this BMW sells two and a half million cars a year,
[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:22.560]   Tesla sold 370,000 last year.
[02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:23.560]   Wow.
[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:25.320]   I wouldn't say they're getting crushed by.
[02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:26.320]   You're right.
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:27.960]   That was an overstatement.
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:33.400]   But some of the most lucrative parts of their market, they're losing business to Tesla in
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:38.640]   some areas that are very concerning to them is maybe fair.
[02:52:38.640 --> 02:52:39.640]   Yeah.
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:44.360]   And that's why everybody's transitioning their technology to adopt the same kinds of things
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:45.360]   that Tesla is doing.
[02:52:45.360 --> 02:52:48.480]   I am excited about the Apple phone being my car key.
[02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:50.320]   Is that a good thing you think, Sam?
[02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:51.320]   Oh, God.
[02:52:51.320 --> 02:52:52.320]   Yeah.
[02:52:52.320 --> 02:52:54.680]   Actually, there's your phone or car?
[02:52:54.680 --> 02:53:00.600]   Well, no, I mean, there are cars now that already offer NFC car keys, but they do it
[02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:01.600]   through Android phones.
[02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:05.480]   One day does it, Tesla does it.
[02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:10.280]   But the reason it's only works with Android phones is because Android allows developers
[02:53:10.280 --> 02:53:14.320]   to have access to the NFC chip in ways that Apple doesn't.
[02:53:14.320 --> 02:53:19.200]   Apple's building it directly into the OS, which in theory should make it maybe a little
[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:20.680]   more secure.
[02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:22.800]   But you can get it already now.
[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:25.200]   You can go buy a new Hyundai Sonata right now.
[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:26.200]   Can you already have that?
[02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:27.200]   Can you do these sharing?
[02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:30.800]   Because one of the neat things I thought about the Apple thing is I could then send it.
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:33.000]   I could say, "Shira, here's the key to my car."
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000]   You could send a digital key to the factory.
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:36.000]   Oh, actually that's smart.
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:37.400]   My phone always dies, though.
[02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:38.400]   I know.
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:39.400]   It would be no good.
[02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:40.400]   Yeah.
[02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:41.400]   Yeah.
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:42.400]   You couldn't get in your car.
[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:44.200]   No, I'm sure they have a way to get in without the car.
[02:53:44.200 --> 02:53:46.320]   The next stage is going to be ultra wideband.
[02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:49.240]   Like what we saw demoed at CES with NXP.
[02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:51.200]   They're working on that.
[02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:52.200]   That's good.
[02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:56.600]   And the new Volkswagen Golf that's on sale in Europe now already has ultra wideband built
[02:53:56.600 --> 02:54:00.520]   and they're using ultra wideband for the key fobs.
[02:54:00.520 --> 02:54:06.040]   And as soon as the standard is complete for the digital key for the phones, then they'll
[02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:07.040]   enable that as well.
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:10.960]   It'll be a lot more secure than the current key fobs, which are fairly easy to hijack
[02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:13.320]   and steal the car.
[02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:14.320]   Thank you for being here, Sam.
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:15.560]   I'm glad we were able to get that.
[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:17.720]   And I forgot I meant to ask you about that as well.
[02:54:17.720 --> 02:54:20.000]   Jason Heiner, it's so great to have you.
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:23.080]   He is always a joy to be with.
[02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:26.160]   Jason, of course, editorial director at CNET.
[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:27.160]   He's at Jason Heiner.
[02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:28.160]   Anything you got going on?
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:30.760]   You got anything you want to plug?
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:35.200]   I just wanted to say, you know, thanks for letting me be in the Zoom where it happens.
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:40.160]   Or if it's a while to be in the Zoom where it happens, the Zoom where it happens.
[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:42.160]   I love it.
[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:45.520]   Thanks for letting me be here.
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:46.520]   Always a pleasure.
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:49.760]   Shira, great to see you again.
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:52.120]   And yeah, always fun.
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:55.560]   And don't forget to catch Jason's interview with Dr. Benjamin.
[02:54:55.560 --> 02:54:59.720]   That should be a must watch in her book, Race After Technology.
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:00.720]   That's at CNET.com.
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:02.360]   Yes, please.
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:10.320]   Actually, this week, too, coming up interview with technology and where we go from here
[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:13.520]   with Sal Khan from Khan Academy.
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:14.520]   Nice.
[02:55:14.520 --> 02:55:15.520]   Oh, wow.
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:16.520]   That's awesome.
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:17.520]   Nice.
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:18.520]   That'll be really good.
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:21.280]   And that's Shira Lazar, who is giving me an Academy.
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:22.280]   So is this.
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:24.080]   And how to be with it all the time.
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:26.360]   I feel much more peaceful.
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:27.360]   It's always good.
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:29.000]   It's really always a pleasure to see you, Shira.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.120]   Peace inside.live.
[02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:32.760]   Where's your radio show?
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:34.760]   Yes, on radio.com.
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:37.200]   It's either as a podcast.
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:42.040]   Just search, let's go there or channel Q radio on radio.com and we're live four to
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:43.040]   seven p.m.
[02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:44.360]   Pacific weekdays.
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:46.360]   We are channel Q.
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:47.360]   Yeah.
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:48.360]   Yes.
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:49.360]   There we go.
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:50.880]   Let's go there.
[02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:51.880]   Let's go there.
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:52.880]   I love it.
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:53.880]   Exactly.
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:56.560]   From the news, four to seven p.m. Pacific.
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:55:57.560]   And that's streaming everywhere.
[02:55:57.560 --> 02:55:58.560]   Anyone can listen.
[02:55:58.560 --> 02:55:59.560]   Yeah, radio.com.
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:03.280]   We're also actually in 36 markets on the radio on HD2 and AM.
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:04.280]   Aren't you awesome?
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:05.920]   And FM in some places.
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:10.800]   But yeah, go to radio.com since a lot of us aren't in our cars or have access to HD2.
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:11.800]   Yeah.
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:12.960]   Very nice.
[02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:13.960]   Thank you, Shira.
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:14.960]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:17.840]   We appreciate you spending some time with us.
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:21.960]   We do a Twitter every Sunday afternoon even on a holiday weekend.
[02:56:21.960 --> 02:56:23.200]   This is the only thing I had.
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:25.440]   I actually had a little mini vacation.
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:27.600]   I didn't do anything Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:29.600]   Did this Sunday I get tomorrow off?
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:30.600]   It's weird.
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:31.600]   It's so jealous.
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:33.160]   Well, I can't go anywhere.
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:34.160]   So I sit on the back deck.
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:35.160]   I don't care.
[02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:36.160]   I love hanging out at home.
[02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:37.160]   I know.
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:38.160]   It's not so bad, actually.
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:39.160]   Not having anything to do.
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:40.160]   It's not so bad.
[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:41.160]   It's not so good.
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:42.160]   It's not so good.
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:43.160]   Yeah.
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:45.800]   I will be back Tuesday with iOS today, Mac break weekly and security now.
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:48.400]   A regular schedule gets back.
[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:49.400]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:55.680]   We do Twitch Sunday afternoons, 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:56:55.680 --> 02:57:01.320]   If you want to join us live, you can watch the stream of us making the show basically.
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:02.320]   We're going to cut out all the digressions.
[02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:04.320]   So you're going to miss all the good parts.
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:06.120]   Yeah, that's what you always say.
[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:10.040]   Yeah, I never cut anything out because, hey, it's all good.
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:12.720]   Twitch.tv/live, audio and video streams.
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:14.680]   If you're doing that, you should be in the chat room.
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:16.200]   That's a great bunch of people.
[02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:21.000]   24/7, there's somebody in there hanging out talking mostly about tech, but a variety of
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:22.000]   things.
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:23.880]   It's a family friendly, well moderated.
[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:28.400]   We have great mods that's at IRC.twitch.tv.
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:32.160]   Of course, all the shows we do at Twitch are available on demand, both at our website,
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:33.920]   Twitch.tv.
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:37.520]   Also on YouTube, and by all means, subscribe.
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:46.160]   Get your favorite podcast app, PocketCasts or Overcast, Slackers, Stacker, Stitcher,
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:47.160]   whatever.
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:49.240]   Get your favorite and subscribe.
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:54.320]   That way you'll have it available to you every Monday morning as you head for your
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:58.880]   commute from the kitchen to the living room.
[02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:01.160]   It's a short commute.
[02:58:01.160 --> 02:58:05.840]   If you just listen during the commute, you'll get about four years worth of show.
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:08.840]   It's just every 10 seconds at a time.
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:09.840]   Thanks everybody.
[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:10.840]   We'll see you next time.
[02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:12.240]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:24.240]   Bye bye.
