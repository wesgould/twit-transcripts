[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   It's time for Twit.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   [ Music ]
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   On the show today.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   He's about a year old, right Patrick?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   11 months.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   11 months.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   He's the cutest baby in the world.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Ladies and gentlemen say hi to Sheamus Norton.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Which has a great name by the way.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   What's his middle name?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Well, we'll talk about that some other time.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Oh, it's a secret?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Okay.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   No, actually I've been reading some interesting stories about identity theft
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and people are going up already.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's a good point.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We don't know exactly when he was born.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   He is wearing a spore t-shirt, which I like.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   That's very attractive.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Patrick Norton is also here in studio with us, which is great because he brought the baby.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   So it's nice to see him.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And little Sheamus is going to be a good boy during this boring conversation.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Aren't you?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   He's like, I'm going to start chewing on cables.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Yes, you are.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   There's good tasting cables just like licorice just all over the place you can have those.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Don't encourage.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Also, John C. de Vorac is here via Skype from his home overlooking the racetrack.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   A beautiful Albany, California.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   In fact, if you listen carefully, I think you can hear the bugle call for the fourth race at Bay Meadows.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Hey, hey, Mr. D'Orac.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   D'Orac.org/blog.

[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Also with this, and I'm really thrilled to have him, Mr. Patrick.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Well, Ryan and Patrick seem to go together.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I don't know what this is.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   We've got a bunch of Irish people here.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Ryan Block, formerly of Engadget.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And now with a new enterprise, and we're really excited and I'm sure he's going to tell us all about it.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Hey, Ryan, it's great to have you back.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Thanks, Matt.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Could be back.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So you're like the number one, what are you?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Number five?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Number one technology podcast, number five on iTunes.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Pretty impressive.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Yeah, you know, this, that's changed daily, but, you know, I think it might have gone down a little bit.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You don't have to tell me.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I know.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   They also favor, not to take anything away from the accomplishment, but they also favor new podcasts in a big way.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I've had my heart.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Well, a little bit.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah, so the way it actually works, not that I think we need to discuss it in too much depth, but it looks at activity, right?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So it looks at basically new subscribers.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And of course, if you have a new show, you're going to have the most new subscribers that day, you know, just statistically speaking.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's a little deceiving, guys.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   We really like the record charts, you know, it's to be number one on the record charts.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You have to have a new record, obviously, because it's based on sales.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   How much is this week?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And heavily weighted right and heavily weighted towards sales in the last couple of days.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   But, but, but, but nevertheless, the tech podcast hasn't debuted in the top 10 in quite some time, so it's quite an accomplishment.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Thanks.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It's, is it now?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Do you pronounce it?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It's GDG, GDG,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   DJ.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   How do you say it, right?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   GD, GT.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's like the word gadget, but with no balance.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   You can call it gadget, but we chose to call it GDGT because if you say, oh,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   go to gadget.com, you're not going to get our site.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   You're going to get, you know, a squatter.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Plus, plus, plus, there's some confusion with end gadgets and since both, by the way, it's
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   you and Peter Rojas, Peter, and you've, you've founded, you've founded Engadget, right?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I was, I was one of the early editors.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah, I was, I was there at the very beginning.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Peter is technically the founder of Engadget.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   He's also the founder of Gizmo.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So, so, Peter and I have been working, you know, together on Engadget since the very beginning.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   That's a pretty good heritage for a, it's got to be a gadget site, right?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Yeah, no, it is a gadget site.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   We said pretty much upfront and, you know, the heritage doesn't just come from Peter and
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I, we wanted to extend that and we wanted to be kind of a little bit of a new focal point
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   in the gadget world.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   So, you know, we reached out to some friends and colleagues and what we haven't announced
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   the, you know, the full roster of people who were trying to get involved in the site.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   The first two people who we did mention are going to be on our board of advisors.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So, our, my successor had Engadget Josh Topolsky.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   He's a great guy.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yeah, he's the editor of Engadget.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So, there's still good relationships with Engadget.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Yes, and, you know, for the first time ever, at least for Peter and I and, and especially
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   for any project out there, you know, the editor of Gizmodo is Brian Lam.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Actually, I guess he's the editorial director now.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   He just moved up.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   He's also on our board of advisors.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   You're going directly in competition with Engadget and Gizmodo.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Why would these guys surf on your board of directors?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.160]   Maybe they're not in competition and maybe he wants to take advantage of the fact that
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.400]   these are the two strongest centers for not just activity and reportage of Engadget's
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   but traffic.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   So, I can see where.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.880]   Um, yeah, you know, I mean, we're, we're not, it's not going to be a gadget blog and
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   a gadget news site.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.200]   That's not really what we're after.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   We want to try something different.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.000]   I mean, we've already proven that we can do that.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   So, you're not going to try to do another gadget in gadget or another Gizmodo.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You're going to do something new.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Do you want to say how it's going to differ?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.400]   Well, I can't say too much.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.960]   I mean, if you check out GDGT.com, you can see a little bit about, you know, some of the
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   things that we've said and we're talking about and the things that we're thinking about in
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.400]   terms of, you know, what a gadget site would be that isn't just this, you know, really
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.240]   hardcore news cycle.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.560]   But as the specifics, I mean, you know, part of that is also the same.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.480]   I mean, we want to know what, what gadget, you know, gadget hounds, gadget fiends really
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.000]   want from their, their online content and media and gadget experience because there is more
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.400]   than just gadget blocks and, and, you know, we want to know.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   It's a lot to say.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.320]   A lot more to say than just, hey, here's the newest widget.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.640]   Yeah, but I mean, at the same time, that's, that's kind of where we've been for the last
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.680]   few years and that was part of the reason why Peter and I wanted to try something new
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.800]   is, you know, between Gizmodo and a gadget, I mean, we, we really kind of perfected this
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   engine, right?
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.400]   And, and this is, you know, a news engine for the new media world where, you know, online
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.040]   constantly connected, you get up to the second updates on, on these particular topics and
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.640]   in gadget, you know, I mean, in gadget really redefine that.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.600]   I mean, Gizmodo is good, but we kind of perfected the formula with a gadget and, and raised
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   the bar there.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.400]   And so, you know, now that that's done, well, what comes next?
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   What do we do now?
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.160]   I mean, we're not just looking to kind of dismantle and deconstruct the successes that
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.840]   we've had over the past four or five years.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.240]   I mean, we want to try something different.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.360]   Well, not, not that I'm jealous, but doggy, but writes on the iTunes reviews.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.720]   And I thought I liked Leo's podcasts.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.720]   Wow.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.480]   I loved how well you guys handle this.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.200]   My iPod used to be dedicated to Leo, but now GDGT will be stealing some space.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.400]   Consider that came from doggy, but that's, you don't have to mutually exclusively.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.080]   I got nothing to lose except my Feds.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.160]   So let's talk a little bit about what's going on in the world of technology.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   This was actually a good week.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.320]   You know, sometimes it's a little slow, I guess in the summertime and as September comes
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.120]   on, of course, that's when the big stories start to come out.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.920]   We've got Chrome, we got Spore, we got Nanos.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.320]   We want to take a pick, Patrick, pick one of the, I sort of say Chrome is the one that's
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.000]   really not to take anything away from Spore and it's, it's fabulous, exciting, but I think
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.920]   long term Chrome really kind of fascinates me.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   Have you installed Chrome Devorak?
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   Yep.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.120]   And I don't care for it.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120]   Why?
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.840]   I'm so surprised.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   I don't like it.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.240]   Something fresh from John.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.880]   What don't you like about it, John?
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.920]   I don't think it's ready.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.760]   I think it doesn't, there's a lot of pages that doesn't render correctly.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.480]   I mean the internet's just not ready for it.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.280]   Well, it's, it is a beta, John, just like Gmail.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.000]   Yeah, but it'll be beta forever.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.280]   Just like Gmail, which is still in data.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.400]   The tap things are cool and that's about it.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.280]   So I see that as pointless.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.040]   And then when they pull that stunt with the Yula, where they, you know, basically, you
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.360]   know, took all your children, I thought the whole thing was, what's the stunt with the
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   Yula?
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   Because I didn't see that.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.480]   So the Yula, when it came out, and by the way, Google's back down on this, but the Yula
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.560]   when it came out said, they didn't just back down.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.320]   They actually admitted, you know, they said our bad, we screwed up the Yula in its, and
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.920]   its first incarnation, when this thing came out on Tuesday, it's by the way, it's Google's
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.840]   new internet browser, just what the world needs, a new internet browser.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.200]   It said that everything you create with this browser belongs to Google.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.320]   You still have copyright to it, but we can do anything we want with it.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.880]   And that was a little, that upset people a little bit.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.560]   But you know, I said, even at the time, I said, look, this is just what lawyers do to
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.240]   protect you against things like caching.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.080]   They don't want somebody to come along and sue them saying, hey, this browser cached
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.920]   a copy of my blog post.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.640]   I don't like it.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.800]   But even Google said, yeah, that we just, they said, to save money, this cracks me up.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:49.520]   We, we duplicate the boilerplate from other other contracts and, and it just shouldn't,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.640]   it shouldn't have been in there, they said.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.400]   I wasn't buying that argument.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.760]   You think that they, you're telling me that they go through all this trouble, then they
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.240]   just do cut and paste something and oh, oops, oops, sorry.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.760]   Funny it was only when the users got upset that it changed.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.680]   Have you ever worked for a big company before?
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   Because it sounds like you haven't.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.720]   I worked for plenty, in fact, I've worked for a government.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.360]   I mean, I've worked for plenty of big companies, but the fact of the matter is, you know,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.040]   the fact, if you're going to just let your Google, you're telling me that.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.280]   They're better than a big company.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   And it looks these things over.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.560]   They paid for lawyers by the pound.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.320]   You think they'd have enough lawyers to write a fresh and original contract for every product.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.320]   Well, I expect them to cut and paste to some extent, but it seems to me that they, they're
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.680]   just not aimlessly cutting and pasting.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   Are they?
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.520]   No, and in fact, you got to ask, well, let me look at the other Yuleas, because if this
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.800]   was cut and paste from something else, like rightly, I don't know.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.480]   And how many situations have you been in where you've seen a lawyer that would do something
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.200]   different than the product manager, John?
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.040]   And maybe the product manager didn't double check the Yule in the, you know, in whatever
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.920]   it was put together before it went to law.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.360]   You know, either way, does it really matter because they fixed it and they, you know,
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.360]   reputed.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.240]   No, I'm just saying it's just saying to me that you would not be able to hear that bothers
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.240]   me.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.040]   I'm glad you guys just defend Google to the end.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.600]   No, no, because it's also interesting that, you know, the, the, they also want you to basically
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.280]   default on the way in to send everything through Google so they can, you know, and the same
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.000]   thing is pretty, you know, is, is IE, the where they want you to automatically send all
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.160]   information to Google so they can make the product better.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.320]   I think people were naturally kind of saying to themselves, you know, first of all, Google
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.560]   puts out a comic book.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.720]   And by the way, I got it.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   And it is nice.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   It is, it is a nice comic book.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.560]   They put out a comic book that explains why they did it.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.400]   Apparently, we're not bright enough for them just to, you know, write a paper or something.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.120]   We have to have it in pictures.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.920]   But what they said is, well, we needed to do this because we want to support cloud applications,
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.200]   web based applications, no browser does a very good job of it yet.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   We thought we could do better.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   So we've done a few things that help like having a very fast JavaScript interpreter,
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.800]   putting each tab in a separate process.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.480]   So if one tab crashes, it doesn't crash the whole browser.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.920]   I love this ability to put icons on your desktop or your quick launch tool bar that
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.080]   represents say, you know, some page like Gmail or, or Google spreadsheet or Google calendar.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.840]   So I mean, I guess that kind of makes sense.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.080]   But people were naturally suspicious that saying, well, first of all, it's based on WebKit,
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.080]   which is out there.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   You can download it for Windows or Mac or Linux.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.760]   So I'm not sure that those speed benefits are so obvious.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.160]   Second of all, you know, isn't Google's business advertising?
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.400]   Aren't they, doesn't it sound like maybe they'd like to use this browser to kind of keep
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   an eye on what you're up to?
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   Well, it's advertising and selling information that they glean from all of the search activity
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.040]   and other things.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.600]   Well, and now glean from their browser, right?
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.600]   Not necessarily.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.320]   I mean, yes, they're the way they make money is advertising.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.920]   But if you get to the core of that function there is keeping people in their ecosystem,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.920]   right?
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.680]   And that's how they really want you to Google ecosystem.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.520]   And so they want to ensure, you know, your Gmail experiences as great as it can possibly
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.440]   be and your Google Maps experience as great as possible be because if you prefer using
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.200]   Google Maps, you know, because it works best in Chrome, you know, because they're going
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.760]   to optimize it or whatever.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.000]   Yeah, I mean, you know, the advertising that they can sell you through Google Maps or through
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.720]   Gmail or what have you is going to ultimately benefit them.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.640]   But as a company who lives and dies on the internet and you have one viewport into the
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.320]   internet and that is your browser, it makes no sense not to do one for Google.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   That's a good point.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.400]   Matt cuts who works for Google has been blogging a lot about Chrome.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.520]   One of the things he says, I want to debunk some misconceptions about, in fact, he's
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.600]   had several posts about Chrome and he said, I went to the Chrome team, I asked him, when
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.680]   information is a send back to Google and it's not bad.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.320]   I mean, it's nothing that other browsers don't already do.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.120]   I have to say, Matt's done a good job of defending Chrome.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.000]   And I think the scenario you describe Ryan is pretty sensible.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   I mean, you're right.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.960]   This is Google's viewport to their products.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.480]   They want it to be as good as possible.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:08.080]   Do you think that they want to provide a reference for other browsers and encourage them to move
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.840]   in the right direction or do they want to replace other browsers?
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.720]   I think it's the former because if they wanted to replace other browsers and they didn't
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.960]   want to provide something that was usable for other companies or entities, they wouldn't
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.960]   have open sourced it.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.000]   They would have done a closed source like Safari or IE.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Well, it's based on open source.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.200]   So they would have to have written it from scratch.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   It's based on WebKit.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   No, not necessarily.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.600]   I don't know what all the licenses are for all of the various packages that they used
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.600]   in Chrome.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.400]   But you can take an open source project and close source it depending on the license.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   True.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.280]   I don't know if that's necessarily a truth WebKit.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.480]   But the point is, I mean, okay, yes, maybe they would have done it proprietary and not
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.520]   use WebKit.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.480]   They could have made it close source and tried to be as closed and competitive as they want
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   to be.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:02.600]   Now, I actually like it.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   I mean, I like the idea of having the search in the URL.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.920]   You know, why have a separate search window if you could just...
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.360]   I like the fact that it kind of predicts what you're typing.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.280]   Yeah, but it doesn't force you to use Google as a search engine.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.800]   Remember a thousand years ago when you do a question mark and, you know, type in your
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   search query.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   Yeah, so it's not that right.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   I'm more curious.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.400]   I haven't had a chance to really load it up in one of my classic like 15 windows with
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   35 tabs in each window.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   I want to...
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.960]   I want to try to crash it in another way.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.920]   Yeah, I want to see it do everything it promises to do.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   It's blazingly fast.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.960]   Or maybe that's just because it doesn't have all the extensions I've put on the firewall
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   box.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.440]   That probably is a big thing right there.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.240]   And that's one reason I still use Firefox is because it isn't as capable.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.400]   I mean, I love all my Firefox extensions.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.720]   Now, you know, one of the tricks in Chrome that I really like, I don't know how many
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.520]   people are actually going to use it, but I thought that it was just brilliant is you
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.120]   visit a site and you do a search on it one time.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.120]   And it's always looking at the URLs trying to look for search queries and trying to figure
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.920]   out, okay, how can I deconstruct this and make this usable?
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.360]   So it's like, I went to Engadget.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.440]   I didn't want to get a search.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.320]   There's no standard search query string for that URL.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.720]   It just kind of saw that.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.760]   It recognized, okay, he went to a field that said search.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.320]   He punched in, you know, iPhone or whatever.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.400]   And then this is the URL it got back.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.920]   It analyzed that and then gave me the ability to automatically search Engadget based on
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.080]   that one search I did.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   That's brilliant.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   That's really cool.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.840]   Yeah, it's things that you could do anyway, but it does it kind of automatically.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.840]   And it seems intuitive.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.720]   It seems to kind of do it naturally in a way that makes sense to me.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   You didn't like it.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:39.240]   Why why why why, John, because it was too simple?
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   Well, there's another.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.520]   I mean, it's not like I hate it.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.000]   I'm just saying it's not something I'm going to move to until they, you know, get it doesn't
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.200]   do some pages correctly.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.600]   There's just a lot of little minor things.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   I mean, it doesn't do that.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.800]   I mean, I have certain tools that I use that obviously are plugins that don't aren't going
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   to work on that.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.680]   I'll probably use Firefox day today, but I'll take pages that like my Google calendar
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.800]   and use that facility to make them an application on the desktop and I'll be using Chrome, but
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.960]   I won't even know it because it'll just be a fast web based application.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.000]   That seems like a good use of it.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And then I'll still use it.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   I'm having those plugins.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.160]   That's that was pretty painful.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   I mean, yeah, I don't use too many.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.280]   Just a couple that I use not having them.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.480]   Just a delicious plug in alone.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.040]   If I don't have that, I mean, I'm really stymied.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.360]   Of course, I'm also mostly Mac.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.400]   So I can't say what I'll do when it comes out on a Mac.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.640]   Maybe I will use it all the time.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.640]   I don't know.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.600]   It's very fast, noticeably faster.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.600]   Be interesting for you to do.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.400]   You know, I'm not a huge Firefox user.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   I mean, I do.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:42.120]   I use it because it's the best for most hijacks, things like Gmail and Google Reader and stuff
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.280]   like that.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.600]   But it's just it even three is still really bloated and uses a lot of CPU and memory.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.600]   And it's just not.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   Not compared to Safari.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   It's a far worse.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.600]   I don't know.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.040]   I've as anybody I'm on OS 10 Firefox.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.200]   Firefox is excellent on on Vista and XP.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.800]   But I noticed it just kicks Safari's ass on OS 10.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.240]   I don't know if I'd agree with that.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   Safari.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.600]   I often have Safari using 100% of a CPU right on of a core on my system and not doing anything
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.400]   particularly complicated.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   You know, and I've cleaned it.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   I've wiped it.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.920]   I've rebuilt it and it still ends up tying up.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.640]   You know, I would like to do is sit it down Chrome versus WebKit.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.800]   And you can do this on Windows or Mac and really see if there's a substantive dis difference
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.200]   or if it's really just that they've taken WebKit and chromed it.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   So to speak.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.800]   Hey, we're going to take a break.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   Come back and talk.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.800]   I do want to talk about Spore.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.520]   I was playing it today.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.280]   And Ryan was at the party, which looked really, really cool.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.360]   We're going to do that in just a second, but I want to welcome a brand new sponsor to the
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.680]   show Qualcomm Qualcomm Qualcomm and go be you know, go be is not even a little bit the
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.120]   global mobile internet from Qualcomm, the new go be device.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.720]   I got to get one of these.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.960]   It's a wireless network card.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.200]   It's being built in a new notebooks.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.520]   A lot of manufacturers are using it.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.720]   And what's cool about it is it supports both HSDPA and EVDO.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.680]   You can do it across multiple wireless carriers.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680]   Interesting.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.400]   It's no longer carrier specific.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.480]   Is it a mini PCI card or a USB or?
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.000]   They're actually building it into the lap.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.160]   You've probably seen some of these, Ryan.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.320]   They're building it into the laptop.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.520]   So the idea is it's there's where the global comes in.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.360]   You know, you know, if you buy a sprint card, it's US only.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.200]   If you buy a rise card, US only go be go be.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.920]   It's kind of they call it the world is your hotspot multi mode so that no matter where
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:37.640]   you go in any geography, use the same notebook and you set it up to work with whatever works
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.960]   in that area.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.720]   So you don't have to carry around external cards.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.080]   Go be when you're looking for a laptop.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.160]   You want to look for go be the world is your hotspot.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.000]   Go be powered notebooks are now available from many notebook manufacturers.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.400]   Go to G-O-B-I anywhere dot com go be anywhere dot com slash products G-O-B-I anywhere dot
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.960]   com slash products.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.760]   We thank Qualcomm and go be for their support.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.400]   Have you seen anything's Ryan the laptop?
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.240]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   That's a great idea.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.840]   I didn't know that existed.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.920]   That's why they I guess that's probably why they bought an ad.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.360]   Let the world.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.800]   Let the world know.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.520]   So how was the sport party?
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.600]   Was that was so I guess I was the only one who was there.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.040]   Yeah, we're not we don't rate that kind of a fine event.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.920]   Did you get an invitation?
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:34.200]   No, I was mad because Kevin Rose and Veronica and a few other people got the creature creator
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.680]   in advance for chair.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.920]   I was a charity thing and I wasn't hip enough to get that even.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.960]   New sport leopardy stuff.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   We're just not so enough.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.400]   So tell us about the party.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   The party.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.880]   You didn't go on Veronica's ticket did you?
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.280]   You got it your own invitation.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.840]   Oh, I actually went on Veronica's ticket.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.560]   I know it.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.840]   Well, that's the funny story is they've been inviting me to all of their but they've been
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.000]   doing like a party a month and they've been really consistent about making sure that I've
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.560]   had an invitation and then they didn't give me an invitation to this one.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.480]   I was really confused and this is the only one that I actually wanted to go to because
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.040]   this is like the launch party.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.200]   This was like Thursday or Friday and it was where was it the museum?
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.440]   It was the it was that the California Academy of Sciences which hasn't actually opened yet.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.440]   That's the brand new one.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.440]   I am so jealous.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.400]   It was brand new and right across from the D. Young big art museum out here in San Francisco.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.000]   It's the greenest museum in the world in terms of construction.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.440]   It's all done with pretty much entirely recycled materials.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.840]   There's a lot of the architecture that they did.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.560]   I actually, I'm sure I sound a little bit like a press release right now because I was
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.400]   speaking to their director of communications.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.080]   But I mean, the stuff that they were talking about was pretty straightforward.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.480]   But yeah, like tons of recycled materials.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.400]   The way that they had architected like some of the roofs where it was like a natural heat
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.240]   flow kind of think where it's a living roof essentially a living roof.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.960]   Yeah, there was a living roof but then it was like curved down and then it funneled into
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.040]   the building in a certain way.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.720]   So it's like in the atrium, the cool air from off of the roof would come down in so they
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.800]   don't have to use air conditioners in the atrium.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.480]   So it was just really, really unbelievable space and very appropriate.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.160]   Now Will Wright of course the creator Spore was there.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.680]   He's been working on this for years.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   He was there.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:28.000]   He gave one of his infamous Will Wright speeches which is he's just like this interdisciplinary
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:36.080]   renaissance man and his speeches are known far and wide for just being completely jam
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.880]   packed with like almost dozens if not hundreds of random topics and references.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.240]   And then he and his near infinite brilliance is able to kind of tie them all together one
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   cohesive narrative.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.280]   Well, he has to be able to do that.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.080]   He wrote a game that goes from single-celled organisms to space travel.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.680]   So he has to know everything, right?
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:00.120]   He's clearly a very brilliant person but he was not the smartest person in the room.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.720]   They had a number of astrophysicists and astronomers and scientists who I guess they'd done like
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.720]   a National Geographic special.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.520]   Discovery had it.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.400]   Actually no National Geographic too.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.760]   And so they had a bunch of people out who were really excited about Spore because these
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:25.760]   are people who I guess they felt really strongly about the concepts that you're going from
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.920]   single-celled organisms to advanced life and stuff like that.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:34.720]   And so one of the people who's most known I guess for his opinions in that space is a
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   guy named Frank Drake.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.760]   He did Drake's equation which science geeks know as the equation that kind of puts the
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.280]   odds on intelligent life in the universe.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.000]   He created a study in fact to find intelligent life.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.920]   Because he said there are some things out there.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:57.000]   Right and so the theory there is okay so if there's X billion galaxies and in each galaxy
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.840]   there's X billion stars and for each star or star cluster there's X habitable planets
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:09.120]   to multiply that by X possible planets that might be able to have the necessary elements
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.120]   for life.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.560]   And you come at a number and that number is the basic mathematical odds that there's
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.240]   intelligent life out there.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.840]   And so he was there and he spoke and it was just unbelievable.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.400]   It was just mind-blowing experience.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.200]   What did he talk about?
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.320]   Basically everything I just said except said it in a way that is a hundred times more
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.400]   brilliant than anything I could probably ever come up with.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.280]   And then they did they have like a really advanced planetarium simulator that was all
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.080]   done in real time.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.520]   And you know I mean those things are always amazing where they show you the true scale
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.960]   of the universe.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:51.080]   And it was I mean all I have to say is it was mind-blowing and incredibly humbling event.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.360]   So did you get to play the game at all?
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.720]   Just a little bit probably not as much as you have.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.960]   I played it for about 45 minutes I downloaded it because you can get a download of it.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.800]   Now in fact they did something, EA did something really clever they allowed you to download
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.160]   it for quite a while but it wouldn't work until midnight tonight, today September 7th.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.440]   Yeah I think it was a good idea.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.720]   I mean I think it probably I don't really have sales figures but I've got to think this thing
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.520]   is hugely successful.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.360]   I am so sick myself of shooting people in games and this thing is fun.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.960]   Although I did create a carnivorous creature so I do have to eat other creatures.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.440]   So you have eating and gnawing and tearing and rending of flesh.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.480]   You design the creature you start with a single cell organism and you design it well your
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.960]   first choice is very simple.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.080]   Carnar carnivore or herbivore.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.600]   But then as you evolve you get more choices as you know spines and spikes and where you
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:47.360]   put eyes and you have sillier for faster swimming and turning and as time goes by I presume
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.960]   I haven't gotten, I'm still in the primordial ooze but as time goes on I think you know
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.320]   obviously you'll make other choices in terms of civilization and so forth.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:01.280]   This seems like the culmination of Will Wright, the guy who did The Sims and Sim City and
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.640]   all of these great simulation games.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.000]   This seems like the culmination of an amazing career frankly.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.080]   This is the ultimate game.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.680]   The question I think and I know that this maybe seems a little bit redundant and especially
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   given the light of how much scientific research Will and his team did in doing spore, maybe
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.280]   it's not even worth asking but I mean there are certainly themes about this that suggest
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   intelligent creation.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.680]   And I know that that's interesting.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.760]   You see it that way, you think that it has an intelligent design.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.400]   Look I don't personally see it that way and I know for a fact especially having seen him
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.040]   speak that they are looking at this from a purely scientific one.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.760]   It's all about evolution.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.440]   Right but at the same time I mean as a player in the game.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.360]   Oh I guess you are gone aren't you?
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.440]   It's waiting for you to pick up on that.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   Yes that's true.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.600]   So I mean you know in order to play the game you have to act as an intelligent creator and
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.880]   that's just kind of a fact of the game.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.480]   I don't know if that was something that they could even really get around because if you
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.480]   weren't.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.480]   If you're going to have a game you have to have somebody play it.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   Otherwise it would be boring.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.160]   If it was just like you know pure evolution in theory then you wouldn't be playing the
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.960]   game you just be sitting there watching it.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.960]   You know it would play itself.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   Right.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.520]   By the way if you hear little spore sounds in the background it's not me playing the game
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.480]   it's Patrick's little spore.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.120]   Shameless who's joined us in the studio and is having his bottle now.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:35.240]   So I don't know I mean I think that there's something to be said for the fact that you
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.400]   know whether or not they like it there's an implication of intelligent design.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.400]   But I don't personally.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.680]   I hadn't really thought about that.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.800]   In fact I was thinking boy this is really evolution here.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.280]   But you're right it isn't random evolution it's not.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.280]   It's guided evolution.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.320]   Yeah it's not natural selection by any means.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.240]   I don't know I look at like the human knees and the lower back and certain aspects of society
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.760]   and the whole intelligent aspect of the day may have been designed.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.080]   You know and I've seen some of the creatures people have put together carnivorous chickens
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.560]   with eyes on really inappropriate parts of their body and it's just.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.560]   I don't know.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.560]   Well that's the difference.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.560]   Yeah it's a game.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.560]   It's a game.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.080]   So far and I've only played it like I said for 45 minutes and I don't I'm really afraid
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.440]   of playing anymore because otherwise this whole network is going to completely collapse.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.360]   But it's very fun and it's beautiful.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:27.280]   I mean it's really gorgeous simultaneous releases for Windows Mac Nintendo DS.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.320]   There's going to be an iPhone I guess mini version of it.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.200]   There are going to be any versions for other phones.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.920]   Ryan will those be they won't be full playable games.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.600]   How will they relate to what you're doing on a desktop.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:44.240]   So on the iPhone basically it's kind of like almost a mini game that is.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   Unrelated.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.280]   It's not not unrelated.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.680]   I don't necessarily know how they're going to fit it in to the desktop game.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.440]   I don't know if the single cell organisms that you create in the iPhone game somehow
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.160]   get transferred over and then you know built upon.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.160]   I don't know about that.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.160]   I do not know that you know that.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:06.280]   They talked about this weird kind of massively single player architecture where you I remember
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.960]   a year ago when they were talking about somehow your creature would kind of float through other
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.440]   people's environments.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.680]   And actually when you play the game you see a lot of other creatures clearly design most
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.960]   of them same axis.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.320]   But I suppose over time they could I could see one that says popular with yeah and I
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   could eat you.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.720]   And that's kind of fun thing is you see these other creatures and I guess they're autonomous
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.680]   by the time they get on my machine.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.720]   But I can interact with them by fighting with them I guess.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   I don't know.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.160]   I just keep coming back to wondering whether or not this will become a required you know
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.920]   teaching tool in Kansas.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.120]   I somehow doubt it.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.360]   I somehow doubt it.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.040]   John you're you're you'd like to play games but more importantly your kids like to play
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.040]   games.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.440]   Are they excited about sport?
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.440]   They don't get excited about stuff until they get a whole of it and start playing it.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.080]   They're not susceptible to pre publicity hype.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.080]   Your high cure straight and very well.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.240]   Cure them of hype.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.640]   So I'll find out later.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.880]   I well early reviews.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.000]   I mean I mean I don't have to be honest about it.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.040]   I mean I've you know there's there's all kinds of things going on in the gaming business
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   right now.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.160]   This may be the last great game because things are kind of going backwards because of the
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.440]   barriers to entry for newcomers with you know all these other games are becoming so
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:31.240]   complicated unless you've kept up with them you can't just jump in late and my son is
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.720]   very following this quite closely.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.680]   Does he want to be a game designer?
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   I don't know.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.320]   You know he's designed a few games already but whether he wants to be one is another
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   issue I don't know.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.120]   Is this Eric you're talking about or?
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.120]   No JC.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.120]   JC.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:50.200]   You got some smart kids because by the way congratulations I guess we mentioned this
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:58.360]   last week but Eric's made his Craigslist tool open source which are there a lot of now
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.360]   people adopting this?
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   I don't know.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   It was about I think well a couple three weeks ago in the announced that he got 300
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.840]   people putting it up immediately and then some some guy came out with some some way of
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:16.120]   using the code so it's he had some screwy thing where you don't need a database and I
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.200]   forgot he's going to put it online it is just going to be floating around I guess he's
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.080]   off to doing something else now.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:31.080]   We're going to take a break talk more about the world of technology Michael Moore's skipping
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:38.920]   theaters going straight to the net a NBC a band in Silverlight and Mark Andreessen has
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:44.160]   a reaction to Chrome but before we do that I want to mention our good friends at Visa
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.080]   the show brought to you with Visa you know with every purchase that you make online
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.680]   or off Visa does some amazing things prevents detects and resolves online fraud with very
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.880]   sophisticated software designed to protect you when you shop.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.760]   We all have better things to do when it comes to shopping online than worry about is it
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.240]   safe all the purchases you make are safe and secure with Visa Patrick's going to take a
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.960]   little break and change the diaper will be this is perfect timing.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:17.440]   Well Patrick changes his diaper I'm sorry shame it's his diaper.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:24.280]   We'll mention Visa zero liability you're not liable for unauthorized purchases we got
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:32.680]   to get a diaper changing table in here Colleen that's peace of mind safe secure Visa we thank
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:40.800]   Visa so much for their support of this week in tech so Patrick will be back it's good
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.120]   though because he'll do this during the show when he's on Skype and this way we can kind
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.240]   of we know where he's gone.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.680]   See I still don't know John when you get up to a baster roast so.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   As it were.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.840]   As it were that's what we call it so the kids call it.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:02.720]   So I did I forgot to mention this but in an interview Mark Andreessen was he was talking
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:08.360]   to portfolio magazine editor Kevin Manie at the Churchill Club in Palo Alto said that
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.600]   any desktop application that has not been implemented in the browser is now going to
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.560]   be implemented in the browser.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.200]   He was very he called a chrome an extraordinary event he said it's going to make Firefox and
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:26.400]   Microsoft Internet Explorer completely compete actively with Chrome ultimately boost browsers
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   as a whole he says Microsoft can build good products when they want to and he believes
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.520]   the pressure crumbs going to put on them will make IE get better I think that's that's certainly
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.520]   true.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:42.280]   He also says if JavaScript gets any faster develops developers will question whether they
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.120]   should develop and flash or silver lighter or anything so super interactive browsers
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.120]   that sits on top of a super fast connection.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.720]   Now interesting things are going to happen over the next five or ten years that sounds
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:34:01.320]   he's he's the guy invented Netscape and wrote mosaic before that saying this is a significant
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.520]   development.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:09.800]   Yeah you know I buy it to a certain extent I really do and I really do think that you
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.360]   know clearly the movement is towards putting applications online for so many reasons and
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.840]   we don't even necessarily have to get into those.
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:23.320]   Where do you stand on cloud computing John I can't remember you I'm the big no I don't
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   like cloud computing guy because I don't trust the cloud a I don't trust other people with
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:35.320]   my data be the net slow see I mean I can go on and on and on it's not reliable.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.000]   I mean it's great I think cloud computing is great for certain kinds of functions I
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.640]   just wrote about this recently saying hey there cloud computing is fantastic when I
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.120]   needed like an emergency word process or something like that but I'm not going to start
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.280]   doing my word processing on the cloud.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.680]   Maybe not word processing but you know I have to say having my calendar in the cloud
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:57.640]   makes so much sense having my mail in the cloud makes so much sense I think for the
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.640]   right application.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.440]   Yeah for you know I do mail in the cloud myself and it's it's probably better I mean it's
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:09.080]   still slow and and the the calendar I use Google calendar because it's got a lot of
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.200]   features that I like but you know it's not it's not necessary I mean it's it's actually
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.640]   pretty fast it's acceptable but there's it's you know it's kind of ugly say the leaves.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.480]   I think the thing that you're you're neglecting to mention is that especially Google Apps
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.240]   have a lot of hooks for offline implementation so let's talk about Gmail that's a great example
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.840]   they have iMap and they have pop so you don't even have to keep your email and Gmail you
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.840]   can just receive it there.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.600]   No in fact that's how I use the iMap capability to get an Apple mail.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.680]   It did take a long time for them to do iMap.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.720]   It did but it's not the best iMap implementation ever I use fast mail for that but it's still
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.920]   it's iMap.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.120]   You look at you know calendar they've got iCal they've got IML.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.720]   We use we use the Google calendar for our Twit Live stuff because you could subscribe
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.680]   to it in so many different ways you can have it in your eye as you said in your eye calendar
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.960]   you're outlook you can have a web based page.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.440]   Right now that's all fine and dandy I think everything you say is absolutely correct but
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.040]   then what do you have what do you do with the person out there who happens to have a Gmail
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.120]   account and suddenly because somebody has accused them of being a spammer or whatever
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.280]   which happened to a guy just recently next thing you know he hasn't got his account he
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.960]   can't get to his email and there's nothing he can do about it.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.600]   Well that's your ISP can do that too.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.400]   Yeah that's fine.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.440]   The ISP doesn't save me either.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.560]   That's another example of the situation where you can get yourself into trouble.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.680]   What are you going to run your own mail server?
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.600]   No I'm not going to run it if it's only about mail that's one thing.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.200]   You know that's fine if you say cloud computing is I mean that's been going on for 30 years
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.520]   I mean if you want to do that's never been considered cloud computing.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.000]   The idea of cloud computing is thin client never really having local stuff and doing
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.880]   everything in the cloud that's cloud computing.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.520]   I think that is 80 definition of cloud computing and that's not the definition of cloud computing
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.920]   we have today I mean it's a very flexible thing the way that we're looking at it especially
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.280]   as we're making that transition.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.680]   I mean we're not going to be to that very definition of cloud computing where everything
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.840]   is not going to happen for 10 maybe 20 years who knows how long it's been.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.560]   Yeah but I mean Ryan on one hand I hear what you're saying it's a different evolution
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.240]   of cloud computing but it still comes down to if you lose your net connection you're
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.160]   hosed or if there's a problem with the servers you're hosed and if your data's not locally
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:24.240]   held you know what I mean you're you know it may not be if you're you know a gigantic
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.360]   company with 40,000 workstations and massive infrastructure in place it's not so bad but
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.560]   I think for consumers and small businesses it can it can be incredibly liberating because
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.720]   you have these powerful tools you don't have to implement in house but on the flip side
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:43.120]   if there's any issue with your ISP with your data with your internet access you suddenly
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.760]   are denied access to critical tools and like the whole word processing there's there's
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.640]   like 32 it seems like different startups all located within 25 miles of you know downtown
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:38:01.000]   San Francisco that are all doing competing you know word processing will basically like
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   desktop suites office suites and like I don't know if they figure if they can get 2% of
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.520]   the office market they're in good shape or if it's because you know is there some lucrative
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:15.240]   market for online you know I mean it just where's the where's the business model Zoho's
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.320]   got a good business model they give you a few tools free right and then if you subscribe
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.360]   you get more I think that's I mean I think Zoho's a good example I wonder if Zoho runs
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:28.000]   better I bet it does under Chrome I mean it's is Chrome completely agnostic or does it work
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.680]   best with Google I think Chrome is agnostic but Chrome is built and with gears first of
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:40.440]   all which is a great framework for taking web apps offline but it's also built with you
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:45.840]   know heavy JavaScript usage in mind so whereas I don't think in specific it enables anything
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:51.280]   that other browsers don't already do it can speed up the experience so much that it can
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.960]   take otherwise very slow web apps and make them seem a lot more desktop like because
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.440]   of the JavaScript engine they've developed yeah I think that's that's their thesis on
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:08.560]   things yeah well you know we ran actually ran a bunch of you know all the Microsoft apps
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.320]   on Chrome to see if they were gonna do any cheating and they were very they all ran fine
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.720]   it's almost as though they did on these major apps they actually went there to make sure
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.520]   they worked okay so nobody could point the finger yeah but let's you know there was this
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.680]   this other topic that you were talking about which was that before you started on Andreessen
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:32.200]   and I've lost my train what it was but I'm trying to get a net scape saying this is a
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:37.000]   you know a red letter day and browsers is gonna force Microsoft and Firefox to do a better
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.320]   job be more standards compliant be faster basically everything opera's been saying for
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:47.560]   the last year yeah but opera ain't Google I mean I have to say that in fact I think I
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:52.760]   remember I heard opera the chairman of opera not so thrilled about Chrome he wasn't too
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:56.560]   well they said the opera's never really thrilled about anything but opera I think it's safe
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.200]   to say and it's I mean it's it's funny though because we look at Firefox is having done
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:06.520]   this extraordinary job of forcing Microsoft to step up or at least try really hard to
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:12.480]   step up just as AMD made Intel step up the competition's good yeah but it's now suddenly
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:17.960]   we need Google to take out a small open well and maybe it's small isn't the right place
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:22.880]   ain't small not anymore anyhow yeah in open source organization and Microsoft well it's
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.600]   interesting because Mozilla makes most of its money from that Google search window right
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.240]   I mean that's a big profit center for them and I often wonder some of the reason for
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:37.600]   this is just get some of that money back from from Mozilla use our browser and then
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.880]   then we won't have to pay Mozilla so much money I don't know I hear here is the story
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:48.680]   that I had to go to the Twit thing I didn't know this but NBC dropped Silverlight after
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:54.080]   all that is stuck on all the Olympics and everything yes here's the deal that you know
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.520]   if you try to watch football on Thursday on NBC on their website they had it but it was
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:06.320]   flash and and I guess the point they made is during the Olympics 40 million people had
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.720]   to download Silverlight Silverlight just isn't ubiquitous and they said 98% of our audience
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.040]   has flash we're gonna go with flash we're not gonna make you download Silverlight I want
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.400]   to know the backstory on this because Adobe does a lot of work Adobe does a lot of work
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:25.320]   to push people back to Adobe and I can I can see Adobe doing things like oh cutting the
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:31.600]   maybe no but but but like Adobe Adobe on one hand yeah the adoption rate on on flash
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.960]   is certainly higher or flash availability on the desktop is certainly is higher but it's
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.200]   not like it's that hard you know I mean it's it's the Olympics comes once every four years
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.720]   the Olympic has done 40 million people have downloaded I think one the other way I think
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.240]   Microsoft came with that black bag of money to be sure said you're gonna use Silverlight
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:52.080]   aren't you well I am the document they didn't keep coughing up and money is the question
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.880]   I think it's made by NBC that said we're going to use this permanently I mean I think
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.920]   no I think they made a deal for the Olympics and that was it exactly that was always my
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.080]   impression is okay we're gonna do this for the Olympics you're gonna pay us a boatload
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:09.360]   of money to most Silverlight you know through through this particular channel on this particular
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.040]   date and time and then when that's done we're gonna do our thing and but I guess the point
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:19.320]   is when they do their thing they go back to flash unless as you say Patrick Adobe came
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.960]   to them and said whenever Microsoft pay you will double it well Adobe could just I mean
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.320]   Adobe's got the tools in place they've done some pretty incredible things in the last
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.240]   couple years with really stepping like the flash video was a mess hey we're right now
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.200]   you can watch us on flash video yeah but I was saying like quality it is but two years
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.680]   ago two years ago it was it was still problematic doing simple things like I'm not even you know
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   you were trying to do TL TV yeah I mean simple things like you know AV synchronization was
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.960]   was highly problematic so they've gotten a lot of that solved they they brought in a
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.760]   lot of talent to to help them think of video is is not a strange offshoot of of Photoshop
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:59.320]   but as an actual art and science with a long and trans history and broadcast and that's
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:05.920]   certainly a lot of broadcasters they bold it well they bought they've member play yeah
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.160]   and play became another company and that company they basically that's the that they acquired
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.920]   that company that no God no that's the core of the people who are improving smart people
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.480]   yeah but now the tricaster we're using is kind of a descendant of play to write this
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:23.520]   is basically new text this is the video toaster right now actually that that was before the
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:31.000]   fork yes before the fork yeah play basically is a is a fork from new tech or play was based
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.880]   right for from new right they're all related somehow and so that became the globe castor
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.520]   and the other one became the tricaster so there's oh so there is another competing unit called
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:45.040]   the globe castor no a globe it's John let's not even try to explain this one like my life
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:50.720]   control surface Patrick is I do it seems very familiar this is a this is something new that
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.160]   new tech is it's releasing it's a USB control surface for the toaster but it is it's just
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.760]   like a regular switcher so they've had one out this is just a much more detailed they've
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:06.920]   had this before yeah they just had one with considerably do or can you do this I have
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:10.320]   I'm sorry for people who are listening they're going what is he what is he what is he what
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:17.560]   is he what is he what is he what is he what is he what is he what is he what is he what
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:27.120]   okay never mind wasn't wasn't good sometimes you can do too much all right let's move on
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.720]   so let's get away wait before you do that let's finish off the thing here I mean is
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:37.200]   that mean silver light is toast no cuz silver I mean silver lights so it may be toasted
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:42.320]   NBC but silver light is primarily their flash competition Microsoft's gonna keep pumping
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.720]   money into it that's what it's gonna come down to though because Microsoft's done this
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.640]   before they've said oh the great new thing and they haven't pumped money into it that
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.440]   kind of lost interest drifted off and the things died has happened many times before
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.320]   with Microsoft exactly they lose interest in a lot of stuff they lost interest in Microsoft
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:02.040]   at home they lost interest in Microsoft at work so I think it's also Microsoft whether
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.400]   this survives or not that's all it's up to if they can if they're committed to it I mean
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.000]   it's an alternative development platform to flash you know how big that business needs
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.240]   to be to you know is is you know I mean it's I've got the opposite of flex though I mean
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.840]   right over air right cuz air is to take flash stuff put it on your desktop and and really
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.400]   silver light the the really the thing that's interesting silver light is the windows presentation
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:30.360]   layer encapsulated right so you can you essentially take the desktop to the web it's really a
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.640]   tool for making cloud applications and that's that if it's gonna take off that's where it's
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.320]   gonna take off so is the cloud really the future or is this just like what is this like the
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.960]   fourth time in the last 15 years where stuff has swung server side you know what I mean
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:46.320]   this is well we always make noise for about four years but but I think that computing has
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.480]   to catch up internet everybody has to have high speed internet it's got to be reliable
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.360]   hardware it's got to be available all the time if you want to go mobile yeah I don't
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:58.840]   know if we're ready yet I think we're a lot closer than we were 15 10 5 years ago right
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.720]   I think it's a trend in the wrong direction personally but let's go back to this thing I
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.760]   mean I'll continue with that theme and it's stupid for me to to keep repeating myself but
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.600]   I still we're gonna get back to the silver light issue well I thought it's so part of
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:16.280]   it well I thought one of the things about silver light was that it was scalable to HD
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.680]   well everything's scalable to HD John if you have enough bandwidth that's really the
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.520]   server or excuse me the content delivery network and more importantly you have enough
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:33.240]   bandwidth at the end user h delivering HD is easy delivering economical HD is hard we can
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:38.800]   kill I can I can increase the quality of this stream in flash without going HD and kill
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.880]   90% of the audience and go to h.264 I can go to one and a half megabits nobody will
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.560]   be able to see it and it's still not high def I don't know what I what would the bit
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.320]   rate have to be for a real high the current the current rule of thumb for calling something
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:58.520]   high def in a live stream is around a megabit and no one can do that and it's in its high
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:05.120]   def in the sense of 720p ish right that it was 10 is down to one well and let let let
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:10.640]   you're you're you're missing I made something a little too semantic the current video standard
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.560]   dot dot dot that people are referring to as high def when they're advertising the quality
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.080]   of the video dot dot dot video does high def right yeah that's what you're talking about
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.200]   yeah all these companies online that are killer doing like you know high quality high
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:28.120]   def it's like high definicious it's near 720p it has a bandwidth rate that is considerably
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:33.960]   smaller than anything you know it's it's it's like an order of magnitude smaller than broadcast
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:41.960]   and considerably smaller either than even than satellite delivery in most cases have to be
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:46.440]   because I mean even a megabit people say well I've got my you know my my files or my
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:51.080]   Comcast is doing 20 megabits but it has to be a pretty consistent megabit and you can't
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.840]   yeah you can't slow it down with anything well it's also it's also expensive as hell to deliver
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.080]   it is incredibly expensive to deliver this stuff and that's a bigger issue john and whether
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.040]   or not the application can support it it's whether or not anybody can actually afford
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:08.840]   to throw this stuff out into the cloud and still have a you know make enough money off
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:15.000]   of it well this is going down constantly and yeah but you're paying upper bandwidth is
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.960]   a fraction of what you're paying a year to years ago it's not that much of a fraction
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.000]   and the problem is is when you're scaling like when you're scaling video up it tends
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.160]   to you tend to need a content to pull my child off of the hard drives over here that's just
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:33.160]   the hard drive for next week's show don't worry about that hey he's good at getting those
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.120]   out we the stream that we're sending right now is is half a megabit it's five hundred
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:42.960]   sixty four kilobits it looks pretty good it's sixteen by nine I think the quality is pretty
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:51.480]   decent and it is a quarter of a gigabyte an hour per user so we have say two thousand
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.400]   viewers right now that's five hundred gigabytes an hour that the c_d_n_ has to put out it's
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:01.280]   outrageous what they don't know how they can afford it I don't know I mean I it's definitely
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.680]   going down but I don't think quality bandwidth or content delivery is going down fast enough
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:10.080]   to keep pace with what people want for the quality of video look at this pattern I'm going
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.520]   to zoom out the video that we're sending out right now you people can do that there's a
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.760]   little pop out button on the video and go to full screen on it and while it's not I mean
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.960]   frame rate is much lower than thirty frames a second it's certainly you know the color
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.160]   is in his rich and so forth but it's not awful considering it's it's half a megabit
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:32.360]   a second yeah well you know you just qualified there it's not awful it's certainly not unwatchable
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.240]   it's not unwatchable I would say hi dev I'd certainly watch the Olympic kayak competition
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.480]   in this video format if it was the only format available to me yeah it's certainly below broadcast
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:47.200]   standard is below NTSC broadcast yeah I don't know Ryan like the whole bandwidth line is
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:53.520]   I have heard that constantly but you know video is expensive man and definitely not arguing
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:59.560]   that point okay I mean look I mean you know we just launched our new new media stuff this
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.880]   week and we put out a podcast and stuff like that are you doing video or just audio right
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:07.760]   now we have a video show I mean we have an audio show you know we're looking at video
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:13.400]   stuff and you have some positive digits without video at some point right people want but
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:17.080]   yeah you know I mean like you know Patrick and I we use the same content distribution
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:23.800]   network or he uses rev at rev three is we're using a big gravity yeah and you know I mean
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.440]   the costs are well are way low but I mean there's still real costs associated with it
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.640]   especially you know if you move away from audio and you go into video I mean it's just
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:36.520]   yeah it gets real expensive really quickly the great understatement what's that Jane
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:43.400]   I just said I'm a Jane hat you look good in the Jane's terrible cunning yeah I mean it's
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.880]   interesting also the one of my one of my favorite lines is is you know people are always telling
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:54.120]   you how fast bandwidth prices are decreasing and it's almost invariably a ISP of some sort
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.520]   or a content delivery network CEO of some type it's saying about well the prices are
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.520]   dropping precipitously well they are because they want everybody to commit to the business
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.920]   so they can sell them and then they raise the price and they and well now they're not
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.200]   going to raise the price but the cost is dropping a lot especially when you realize a lot of
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:14.760]   the cost is being compared against some of the you know original CDNs that were getting
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:20.640]   right unbelievable amounts that's a thing a fraction of where it was a couple of years
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.560]   ago you know if it was a hundred dollars per gig a couple of years ago and now it's a
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:29.840]   fraction of that which is ten dollars per gig that's still a lot of money right like I
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.800]   mean you know fraction is a fraction but yeah proportionally speaking it doesn't necessarily
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.640]   make it economical always to do this now but it's it's certainly getting economical
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:43.800]   more better faster I mean fast enough to the point where where oh I can't even think of
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:49.480]   the name of it the guys who brought you Skype the video juice juice juice just killed they're
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.800]   a desktop client they're going all web interesting but it's like you know I mean like everybody
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.280]   was like yes juice is going to solve the problem even though it didn't seem to work mathematically
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.800]   for anybody other than the juice developers in terms of the bandwidth that was available
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   upload versus download it almost seems like you know juice major advantages don't seem
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.880]   to have played out in no I think what happened is juice looked at Hulu and said they're killing
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.280]   us right why do we need a desktop client but I wonder what Hulu's bandwidth bill must
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:19.440]   be like yeah they must be losing a lot of money they they're only running what a few like
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:23.080]   an ad at the beginning and the I mean these are short little ads I can't imagine they're
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:28.280]   making money on who I can remember something Hulu is essentially a skunk works for NBC not
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.920]   just NBC by the way yeah a lot of it in all our revision three most of its own and be
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:37.040]   and we have a NBC Universal is essentially the people that are footing the bills and Fox
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:43.440]   for for for when you put your stuff on is Texas along the hula yet I don't know I think
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:47.360]   summer vision three stuff is I'm wondering you don't pay them for that right they just
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:54.600]   carry it you just valued content I think partner is the is the phrase that's used a distribution
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.840]   partner I think that's I think Hulu's been I was not at all positive about Hulu when
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.760]   it came out I said who's gonna sit and watch this on the internet yeah Patrick raising
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:09.640]   his hand in fact I just saw a study that's in the last two years internet video viewing
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:14.360]   has doubled mmm more and people are spending more and more hours all the time watching
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.600]   this stuff on a screen on computer screens which kind of or they have home theaters or
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.800]   some other device connected well how many do you think is that how many people are actually
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:26.760]   doing that that's a great question I think more sitting on their laptop with their laptop
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.920]   and in bed or somewhere on it and watching on the laptop but I mean it's interesting
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.480]   it's you know that's the thing is waiting for sort of and this is probably somewhere
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.240]   Ryan's got a much stronger idea than I do is somebody's gonna come up with the right
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:45.120]   device and it may simply be you know your local cable company it's gonna be a good internet
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.840]   video access device that's cheap enough that everybody will want to buy it right because
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:55.080]   so far cable companies were smart they would try to do that but there are a couple of reasons
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:59.280]   why the cable companies are not going to do that right here smart number one it is because
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.040]   it helps them upsell internet access right so it's like oh yeah of course so totally first
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.800]   they have a the common cast is just capped internet access they don't want to upsell
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.720]   internet access they want to sell premium services they really right so first first they
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:15.440]   have content distribution deals which basically states that they you know they need to do their
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:20.000]   very best effort to make sure that channels get you know as much play and as much time as
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.360]   possible right so there's there's that and that's that's a big thing I mean if you are
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.520]   networking you're making an agreement to get your channel and Comcast you know it's
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.920]   a two way thing you have to make sure that you're providing Comcast good content and Comcast
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:37.280]   in turn has to do everything they can to make sure that you get the best distribution that
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:41.440]   you know people can't pirate your stuff and and so on and so forth so there there are those
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:46.520]   agreements as well yeah but but then on top of that I mean you look at the cable companies
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:51.160]   they have like such a weak technology infrastructure it's just unbelievable and I mean you look
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:57.320]   at Comcast they've been promising a rollout of Tivo's Tivo software on their regular DVR
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.960]   boxes so you'd be able to upgrade your DVR to Tivo right sounds like a fairly simple thing
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.800]   they've been promising this for years years and they still have not been able to manage
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:10.400]   it you know part of the blame falls on Tivo there but you know don't look to the cable
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:16.440]   company for innovation right is all I'm saying but then who you look to Verizon well Apple
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:22.360]   TV not a particularly successful product launch people who use it a lot of voodoo no I only
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:27.760]   want to love it voodoo great amazing selection of content but you know flop but you know
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:35.680]   incredible popcorn flop so it's not a flop popcorn is why why we're saying sorry I was
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:41.000]   gonna say popcorn got an inadvertent amount of coverage for the size it's popcorn popcorn
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.120]   is a is a true geeks product right that got way too much coverage because there are a
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:54.680]   lot of geeks in in in our cool yeah cool need piece of hardware kind of stuff I'm gonna
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:59.480]   use a passion for hard drives I think we've got a little Patrick in the making you don't
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.280]   have a little baby sledgehammer do you good because I don't think we can handle that
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:09.600]   now you know the reason I think a lot of these devices come out and they're not super successful
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:13.840]   is you have the the content wealth garden and if you're if you're talking about a device
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:19.960]   whose only job is to give you know to move content from that device to your television
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.360]   any kind of walled garden is not going to do you know and that that is just the way
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.760]   it is the the only ones that work well are the ones that have some sort of interface
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:34.360]   to the outside you know regular normal content channels and that you know that's like Tivo
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:39.000]   right Tivo's first objective is to be a good cable DVR so you've got cable card you've
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.200]   got clam support you've got you can hook it up to your cable and get your regular television
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:47.040]   channels and then on top of that they'll do downloads and they've got YouTube and stuff
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:52.120]   like that but first and foremost it is you know the regular content means of distribution
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:56.160]   so when you look at like Apple TV yeah I mean they're gonna do a little bit better now that
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.800]   they kind of revamped the whole experience and added movies and and and rentals and stuff
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.920]   like that but still at the end of the day I mean look if you can't watch you know say
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.400]   Hulu which is free content and you should be able to watch that directly through Apple
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:11.760]   TV absolutely you can't watch that then there isn't really that much of an incentive you
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.880]   know I mean there's there's free and then there's paid and if you're going to paid there's
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.840]   no reason why you should have to separate free therefore it's not going to get the
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:26.120]   apply this gear when I when this little guy starts watching TV in 10 15 years it's gonna
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.840]   be a very different landscape Patrick I mean he's he's gonna not be won't be watching on
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.680]   a TV in the living room you think my kids don't ever watch a TV in the living room they watch
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:38.120]   it on the computer that's I mean it's an interesting thought right because broadcast my the first
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:42.320]   cable channel I saw was HBO in our apartment building when I was five it was a single channel
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:48.120]   it was a separate box that did nothing but deliver HBO to I think channel it was a separate
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:53.680]   box yeah it was a there was no cable television and right in the you know we're in that wasn't
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.800]   that long ago was thirty years ago twenty years ago you know and then there's seventy
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:03.920]   channels by the time we got cable in Pennsylvania when I was in eighty five you know satellite
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:07.680]   delivery comes not too soon after you know there's four hundred I think there's four
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:12.080]   hundred digital channels on Comcast San Francisco or something clearly in fifteen years you're
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.040]   gonna see massive changes I guess the question is where's it gonna go and it it's gotta go
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:20.400]   to the Internet right that's the delay that's the less a team economic you know technical
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:25.600]   analysts are correct and the yeah and and yeah and and you know the Internet's going to break
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:35.680]   under the load of video which is a hilarious concept you know I agree yeah we could talk
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:42.120]   about that for quite some time and nobody so I mean it I don't know it's tricky there
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:48.400]   there's a lot of content and I think it's hard to argue that the premium viewing experience
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:53.360]   tends to be on your HD TV from your couch right I mean it's just it's it's the most
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:59.440]   comfortable it's the most immersive experience that you get consuming content in your home
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.600]   and I don't think that that's arguable so you know the question that becomes like well
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.920]   how much more tempting is it to get free content really easy when you're already sitting down
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.080]   at your computer or you know bring your computer to bed or what have you and doing the Hulu
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:17.360]   stuff so at that point you have to be like okay let's get Hulu on the television you
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:22.120]   know we're back to step one which is the networks putting their video online so you can get it
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:27.000]   back on the TV I wonder if it isn't that funny there's an iron you know basically that's
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.120]   called IP TV but the other thing is how much I want to stop everyone here how much TV do
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:39.480]   we really need to watch as much as we can before we collapse John preferably from revision
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:45.120]   three dot com do you agree with my sure well then I should plug me video dot com you know
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:49.960]   do you think do you agree with the other place you're key that we've been watching it thanks
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:55.160]   basically is a way his new book is here comes everybody and I think it's clay shrukey right
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:59.440]   and his his contention is that we we all watch sitcoms because we were just trying to adjust
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:04.800]   to the information revolution in the same way that Brits drank a lot of gin during the
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.840]   industrial revolution it was an arkotic and now we're all coming out of the basements having
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.600]   drowned our sorrows in Gilligan's island and I dream of genie and we're ready to start
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:18.040]   you know creating a lot of the information revolution started in the early 60s with black
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.240]   and white television with Gilligan's island mass media certainly did and the and that was
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.760]   an idea comes pretty as that a matching real with Gutenberg yeah yeah but I mean television
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:33.080]   and was really it was really a information revolution in that sense and yeah certainly
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.800]   you know computing started in the 60s and in in business I think you can make that case
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:45.000]   but an interesting case anyway I don't think my kids watch nearly the kind of well Chris
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.120]   they watch a lot of YouTube and they do watch Hulu they want I mean they watch as much as
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:54.400]   we did I think I think there's definitely according to every survey I've seen John the
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:59.240]   younger kids watch considerably fewer hours of television compared to their parents or
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.320]   maybe even their oldest or eldest siblings but they're also you know they're replacing
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:08.080]   it with online activity internet activity the time they spent on Facebook and MySpace
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.400]   well there's a lot of video games nobody denies it's screen time it's just more interactive
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:16.320]   screen time and that's it to bring it back to what Ryan was saying is maybe you know if
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.920]   you're if your primary audience is to 18 to 24 which is to say like 12 to 18 year olds
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   maybe it goes from the optimal you know consumption area goes from being a lean back a 12 foot
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.240]   a lean back environment in the living room and in the next 10 or 15 years it does become
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.760]   small screen delivery although you know cell phones is your center for media consumption
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.280]   works in Japan but I don't think it's ever going to work as well as in the United States
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.000]   I like that term lean back because it is lean back versus sit forward lean back versus
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.960]   lean forward lean forward is your notebook your desktop PC lean back is your living room
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.320]   environment I think we're leaning more forward than back these days I think that with us
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.340]   this group here we're leaning sideways
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:03.000]   shameless is me is bouncing what are you having a good time on the ball or do you want to
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.800]   go back to data oh he wants to go back to that okay he always thinks don't feel bad he
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:13.240]   did the same thing with his grandmother he's a pretty old man I want to talk about Google's
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:19.320]   new satellite did you see that they launched a satellite and now I'm afraid who did they
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:26.360]   put a little who did they put in it a delta to rocket carrying the GLI one satellite lifted
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:33.120]   off at 1150 am Saturday a super sharp earth imaging satellite launched from Vandenberg Air
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:39.760]   Force Base to make Google the highest resolution of any commercial imaging system in the world
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.320]   you got to love it like when the when a company gets the point where it's cheaper to launch
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:49.960]   their own satellite than to pay for higher quality image satellite imagery slash this
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.960]   is also could be proof that Google is a front for Dr. Evil and it's really filled with lasers
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:01.600]   tech technically G.O.I owns a satellite but it will be used for Google Maps Google mapping
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:09.400]   you'd be surprised how many investment in an application for maps I mean let's like
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:14.880]   let's really think about this Google Maps is great but that is a huge investment for
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:20.800]   maps you know it's G.I.S. is what this is all about and there is a lot of money in G.I.S.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.480]   I don't know if it's G.I.S. so much as the incredible amount of revenue that's possible
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:31.840]   through mapped searches and how easy it's becoming to integrate that into cell phones.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.880]   Yes and I don't disagree with that having location based services having a great map
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.800]   application is so super valuable especially you know because once you start learning where
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.040]   people are at targeted advertising becomes way way easier and I'm not going to argue
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.040]   that fact the fact that I'm arguing is like you're talking about hundreds of millions
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.800]   of dollars for a satellite and that satellite takes you know real nice high resolution photos
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:01.040]   of the actual real world but that is not an essential component of a good map application
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.360]   in fact how often do you use the satellite view I mean I don't know about you I use it
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:09.840]   as like the secondary view and I'm mostly doing my viewing in Google Maps or whatever application
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.800]   I'm using for maps in the street mode you know it would be curious to see how much it
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:19.120]   did actually cost them versus the company that launched it I would be curious if they had
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.160]   exclusive imagery I would really I still haven't been able to figure out and maybe I
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.320]   just didn't read the right part of the article the actual resolution they're delivering it
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.320]   at no they never said because because the well and we know spy satellites the government
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.520]   on spy satellites are much higher resolution than anything I want to see it but I mean but
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:38.120]   there's some pretty amazing commercial stuff but it's not like down to like you know submeter
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.480]   you know much more than like yeah I'm trying to see I azer submeter yeah but I can't buy
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:47.400]   CIA imagery don't get me around Landsat 7 is great in its free and it's available to anybody
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:52.640]   web connection but there's a big difference between Landsat 7 and commercially you know
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.960]   I mean like I'm talking about commercially available so of course you know if I want to
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.000]   you know see the inside of a Nat's ass from space yeah I'm gonna see if I can call it a
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.840]   favor at the NSA but I don't think it's really likely to happen it's not gonna scale to CIA
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:11.800]   photo analyst for many years and the inside of a Nat's ass sorry I was recently in in
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:17.680]   the very rural part of the world and the whole Nat's ass metaphor came up terribly sorry
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:24.200]   John who's hunting by any chance any I'm a strong believer in the second amendment because
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.680]   it was put next to the first amendment for a reason but I do not hunt moose no ever try
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:33.480]   to carry ever try to pack out a moose large animals yes they are if you can't drive to
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.840]   where you're hunting moose I don't want to be involved shot boo winkle we're gonna take
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:44.080]   a break when we come back I want to get the the panels assessment of the churro ad the

[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:47.480]   go to Google and see it Jerry Seinfeld a ten million dollar man 300 million dollar campaign
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.440]   by Microsoft we thought it was a campaign to respond to the Apple switch ads there was
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.640]   going to be some sort of Vista campaign but apparently Microsoft's working on I don't
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:03.840]   know what some sort of chewy centered computer did you watch the ad no apparently not I did
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.760]   you know okay look we have a link to it on the blog devorek.org/blog.com/blog.com I mean
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.960]   it's they're trying to do a sitcom there's no selling it at all unless you think selling
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.440]   shoes or churros is to sell.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.120]   Well somebody pointed out that it's it's an ad about nothing it is well it was a show
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:25.560]   about nothing right or you can kind of see it as a metaphor for a couple things what
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.480]   I think that the metaphor is there okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna preface this by saying
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:34.200]   and I haven't heard this very much but I actually like the ad I enjoyed it.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:48.480]   Oh but that aside so okay the ad takes place Seinfeld sees gates in like a discount store.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:55.080]   I'll play I'll tell you what let me play a little bit of it and just stop me if you
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:59.920]   know if you if you want to say something and John let it let us let us who are experiencing
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:05.880]   it for the first time enjoy it in its full glory full screen and and I should are we
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:13.000]   here and let me see if I've got that yeah we're here.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.360]   So let me go back and start this over because I think I think you really have to understand
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.920]   what we're seeing here.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.920]   So make sure Patrick sees it from the beginning.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:20.920]   So it's Jerry Seinfeld.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.720]   I'm not gonna say anything I'm gonna leave the room.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.920]   Jerry's in the mall Jerry Seinfeld's in the mall and he's walking by a shoe store.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:34.920]   When the chair shoots circus quality shoes at discount prices why pay more.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.440]   Okay so that's the first metaphor.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.280]   Shoes circus quality shoes for less why pay more.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:46.520]   Yeah quality but it doesn't necessarily cost as much as the competition aka Apple.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.520]   Okay so that's a metaphor.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.960]   Oh Ryan this is gonna be tough.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.560]   I'm telling where I see this right okay so I'm like wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.720]   No wait I think I think Ryan may be onto something it doesn't mean that adds any good.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.080]   But yeah okay this is good he's gonna Ryan were you a literature major in college?
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.080]   I was.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.480]   Okay so you're gonna deconstruct this for us.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.920]   I will do my best.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.440]   So now Bill Gates is in shoe circus.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.480]   He looks up at Jerry Seinfeld.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.920]   Sure I'm good.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920]   Seinfeld offers him a churro.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.640]   Is the churro mean anything?
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.960]   I think that's Seinfeld humor it's just random.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.360]   The left one's a little tight.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360]   They'll stretch.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360]   They'll stretch.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.360]   Is that your toe?
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.360]   No.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360]   What is it?
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360]   Leather.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.240]   So is that your toe?
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.400]   No what is it?
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   Leather.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.040]   What I'm hearing in like the it'll stretch it'll stretch is like okay so is this right
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.040]   for you?
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.040]   No.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.000]   Well but it can be like you'll get used to it over time right so that's kind of I don't
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.320]   know I mean I know that some of this sounds like no we're not gonna diss you just that's
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.320]   good.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.320]   Let him finish it.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.360]   I'm actually fascinated by this.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.120]   What I'm hearing there is like look you know like don't go with something that you're not
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.840]   necessarily comfortable just because it seems like you know that's what's getting sold
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.840]   to you.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.840]   No with leather.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.640]   So leather implies quality or the higher end choice.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.920]   I'm not necessarily talking about the shoe circus.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.760]   I think they're talking about windows.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.720]   Right so and right and windows is the metaphor for the shoe circus is a metaphor for
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.600]   windows they're saying that you know you can still get high quality and pay less right.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.440]   And even if it doesn't fit you can stretch it.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.280]   Let's get to the stretching because I found this kind of erotically charged.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.360]   This is a concase to do it.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360]   They run very tight.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.360]   You get the other one.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   You know what I do?
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.360]   I wear them in the shower.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.360]   They're closing the shower and go.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.360]   Never.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.400]   You're dressed and you're clean.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.120]   That's a classic Seinfeld line by the way everywhere shoes in the shower you're dressed
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120]   and you're clean.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.000]   Yeah but I mean that's a joke I'm not reading in an hour.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.920]   No it's a class it's Seinfeld.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.800]   By the way I think Seinfeld has seen his day.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.200]   I think that sense of humor is not funny anymore it's old.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.280]   The door go a bunch of business.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.680]   He's a ten.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.680]   Ten.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.680]   A printable.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.280]   So Seinfeld as shoe salesman.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.280]   Better.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.280]   That's a ten.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.040]   Is that a conquistador?
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.680]   The woman says is that the conquistador?
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   She's looking in the window.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.960]   She doesn't recognize Seinfeld or Gates but she knows it's a conquistador.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   Guess what Bill?
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   You're interesting.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   All of the funny things.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   They can't talk about a shoe conquistador?
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.960]   Really?
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   I don't know.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.960]   I mean again yeah I'm not trying to re-use anything.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.960]   No no wait wait wait.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.000]   Hold on a second you know I think that I'm serious.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.120]   I think Ryan's on to something I never consider.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.800]   I mean I didn't think of this crappy commercial as a Boon Well film.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.400]   But on the other hand.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.160]   It's deeply Freudian.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.960]   But on the other hand, let me press it, preface this with two thoughts.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:52.720]   One, if Ryan's right and he may well be with this interpretation this makes the commercial
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.240]   even all the more worse by being so damn pretentious.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.240]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.240]   But I'm still fascinated by this interpretation because I think you may be honest.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.880]   I'm thinking we're a minute in by the way.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.520]   This is a long commercial.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.640]   So this is Hispanic families looking through the window.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:12.000]   The mom says it's the conquistador and the father says they run tight.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.320]   Father also eating a churro.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.320]   He's also eating a churro.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.720]   So that's appearance number two of the churro.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:25.160]   Bill Gates flashes his clown cub club card which by the way prominently features Bill
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.600]   Gates mugshot.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.840]   This is this is the picture.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.040]   If you do the comparison go to the smoking gun look for Bill Gates mugshot.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.800]   He's wearing the same sweater.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.120]   That's his mugshot.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.320]   That's when he was arrested in Arizona for speeding.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.320]   New Mexico.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.320]   New Mexico.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.320]   That's right.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.480]   I think it's interesting that they put that in.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.760]   Special since he's been a member since '09 on the card.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.760]   That's interesting.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   Was it 1909?
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.400]   That's wait a minute.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.000]   Let's go back there.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.200]   That's not an expiration date.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.440]   Oh, that's an expiration date.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.440]   Oh, it is.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.440]   Exhale.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.440]   Terribly sorry.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.440]   I thought it's a little bit blurry.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440]   It's my American Express bias.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440]   My apologies.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.440]   That's since '09.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.240]   They should have said that member since '81.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.080]   That would have been good.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.160]   What do you get with that card?
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.600]   Big top points.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.600]   Big top points.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.600]   Ryan?
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:19.720]   Again, you know, I think some of this is just amusing and I was maybe I have just like
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.720]   a dumb sense of humor.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.720]   I just thought.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.720]   No, no, I think you know what?
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.920]   I think you're not going into it enough.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:27.880]   I'll bet you big top points mean something in some symbolic way.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.880]   Ego gratification.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.240]   I'll apply some cryptology to that and see if I can actually put it.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   No, that's good.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.480]   I think it means, okay, I think this represents.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.960]   We're saying that this represents the Kinkista door is the Macintosh, right?
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.280]   You choose it not because it fits.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.160]   You choose it for the status and big top points are what you get.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.160]   Yes?
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.480]   Well, no, because he's excited about the big top points, right?
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.080]   So I think, well, I mean, that's just it's kind of a statement on customer loyalty.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.640]   It's like, you know, look, we reward you for customer loyalty.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.120]   We may not be like the flashiest store in the mall.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.440]   But you did get clear top.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440]   Big top.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.440]   Right.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.480]   But you know, they want to reward their customers.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.680]   They want to give something back to the people who are buying their product, you know, and
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.480]   then whereas it's arguable that Microsoft hasn't really done such a good job with doing
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.480]   that.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:19.240]   I mean, it's also arguable that with stuff like Vista SP one and things like that, they
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.400]   are making a commitment to improving their products.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.400]   All right.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.600]   Back to the ad, they're walking out of the store now.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.160]   Apparently Gates and Seinfeld have decided to move in together.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.160]   I don't know why they're watching.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.000]   I imagine over the years you've mind mowed that you're magnet.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.080]   Oh, wait a minute, by the way, both eating churros.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:37.680]   Oh, oh, I didn't notice that both eating churros now.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.680]   It's something.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.280]   They went well, they went back to the churro stall and they got one for Bill.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   There's some sort of homo erotic aspect to this commercial.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.280]   Yes.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.680]   Everything with two guys on a screen have to be homo.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680]   Look what they're holding.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.440]   Well, they get they're holding these churros.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.440]   I mean, come on.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.960]   Actually see how John's logic skews on these things.
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.800]   I mean, it's always erotic.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:00.800]   So I'm not.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:01.800]   Well, look at it.
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.800]   Okay.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:03.800]   So Jerry Seinfeld, wait a minute.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.800]   Let's just go through this.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.800]   I've been using that word for 10 years.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:12.520]   Jerry Seinfeld walks by a shoe store sees Bill Gates in there, helps him choose shoes,
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.680]   helps him fit his shoes, feels his foot up, then says afterwards and we have to fill
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.680]   this in.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.400]   Let's go get a churro.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.480]   They go out and get churros.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.600]   And now he's walking Bill back to the car.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.800]   I ask you and then and then it gets worse.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.960]   Well, yeah, here comes.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.800]   This is by the way that I think the coda for the whole commercial and I really want to
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.920]   know what this means, Ryan.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:38.760]   So please listen carefully as Seinfeld addresses the richest man in the world.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.760]   I imagine over the years you've mind-melted your magnum, Jupiter brain and those other
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.560]   Saturn ring brains of Microsoft.
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.040]   I have just wondering, are they ever going to come out with something that'll make our
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.680]   computers moist and chewy like cake so we could just eat them while we're working?
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.760]   If it's yes, just your shorts.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.600]   Just adjust your shorts.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.360]   And then what is Bill Gates doing?
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.360]   He shakes his ass.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.520]   He shakes his booty.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.520]   Okay.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:15.880]   I think I were my, where am I being like off the wall with my interpretation?
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:17.920]   What is this ad about?
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.520]   Okay, now finally, finally, this is the, we've gone a minute and a half into the ad so far.
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:31.640]   This is the only appearance of any Microsoft logos, signs, sigils, anything in the whole
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   ad.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.280]   Here it comes.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.680]   The future.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:36.840]   Delicious.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.840]   And the Windows logo.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.880]   And the Windows logo is literally on the screen for two seconds.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.000]   Well, I mean, let's be frank.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.760]   There is no better Microsoft branding except the word Microsoft than Bill Gates.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.320]   I mean, all right, come on.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.080]   He's arguably tired.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.160]   Most, yeah, but he's also incredibly associated with the brand that he created.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.080]   You know, he's, he's the most well known philanthropist in the world.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.320]   He's the most well known technologist in the world.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.760]   Yeah, you have to finish your, that's fine.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.600]   But let's finish this interpretation where you kind of get, you kind of stopped us dead
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.600]   in the middle of it.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.600]   No, actually, I kind of followed that through.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.080]   Although, yeah, right, like there was a little bit where it just kind of, you know, I think
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.480]   got a little surreal, I think, just keep interpreting the boom well.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.240]   I mean, I definitely like, I saw the narrative going a little bit off towards the end.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:27.480]   And I don't necessarily know that there's some, some real interpretation in Bill Gates
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.480]   kind of wiggling.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:33.760]   Well, I think it's safe to say that this is not some plea to keep shareholder, you
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.040]   know, expectations high in the wake of Bill Gates departure.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.040]   I don't think that's necessary.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.680]   Because everybody knows he has been running the business.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:43.360]   I don't think consumers really care who's running the business.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.440]   They just want their computers to not suck.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.520]   You know, is this like the sign that they're going to bring a shopping network and green
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.520]   stamps to Vista?
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.160]   I mean, it's just to me as, and the thing that I think that they're trying to address,
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.120]   I mean, clearly they've touched on a few things.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:02.360]   You know, you've got the kind of, you know, quote unquote, "Hoydy, Toydy," kind of, you
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:06.720]   know, ethos of the Mac audience that I think that, you know, they kind of tend to play
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.720]   up in them in the PC versus Mac commercial.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.480]   So this is for the lunchbox crowd.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.240]   Yeah, I mean, maybe a little bit.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.520]   You know, you got that, you've got the price difference.
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.360]   If it was for the lunchbox crowd, you don't use Seinfeld.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.800]   Yeah, I don't understand the choice of Seinfeld at all.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.920]   The system, the systemizability aspect.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:26.520]   So you've got a lot of these themes about Windows, but I think at the bottom line, the
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:32.640]   end of the day, what they benefit most doing is making Windows seem friendlier.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.600]   And that is a thing that they have the biggest prop.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.920]   Is it, is Windows better or worse?
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.240]   Is it, you know, is it the right choice?
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:46.320]   Is it friendly enough, you know, to kind of handle the things I need to handle in my computing
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.320]   life?
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.400]   Or do I need to look for something friendly or easier in the Mac?
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.800]   And I think that's what Apple's been driving really hard.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:56.520]   And that's what Microsoft wanted to do here is they wanted to present this commercial that
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:02.200]   makes, you know, bill and, you know, the consumer experience in general, which is the
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.640]   metaphor here is the metaphor for consumer experience.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.880]   They wanted to make it friendly.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:10.600]   Can we agree that this is, this is the beginning of a much longer campaign?
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:11.600]   I mean, I think they're going to do a sick part.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.480]   This is the beginning of a much longer campaign.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:17.000]   I think that the shareholders should head for the exits.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.240]   And let me say this other thing about the symbolism that you keep bringing up.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.920]   All I'm seeing for the symbolic aspect of this thing is I'm now associating Windows Vista
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:33.640]   with cheap shoes and churros and vaguely, and boxer shorts.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:40.280]   I have to say, they're going to spend $300 million on this.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.480]   They paid Seinfeld 10 million of that.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.120]   It's clearly, I mean, just got to be 16 episodes, right?
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.720]   I mean, where they're going to move in together, Seinfeld's going to eat cereal.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:55.360]   There's going to be a payoff at some point where perhaps, okay, I'll give you a prediction.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.520]   They go to the apartment.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.520]   There's a Mac there.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.880]   Bill Gates asked Jerry, do you use this thing?
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.040]   No, I never could figure it out.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.120]   And they throw the Mac out the window.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.120]   I think there's more here.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.120]   That would be good.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.120]   I think there's a set up.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.720]   This is a set up for what is going to be many, many more episodes.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:12.720]   All right.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.960]   Yeah, I mean, I think that that's definitely possible.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.520]   I think that, you know, as a minute and a half long commercial, it has to kind of stand
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.520]   on its own.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.520]   It doesn't stand on its own.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.280]   It makes no sense at all.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.280]   It's not a really good book.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.560]   I mean, yeah, we're talking about it.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.280]   They got a lot of press for it.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.320]   Yeah, but it's a lot of press for what?
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.240]   For ways to interpret this, then yeah, it might not stand on its own very well.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.000]   And before I actually decide, okay, well, what's the meaning here?
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.800]   Why would they spend a minute and a half of nonsense?
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:45.200]   Even then, I just kind of tried to look at it for its entertainment value and me being
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.600]   like an old Seinfeld fan and I love kerbier enthusiasm.
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:55.160]   And I personally think that kind of irreverent humor is still good.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.160]   I like the commercial.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.320]   I just liked it for what it was and not even necessarily looking at it from an analytical
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.320]   stamp.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:05.080]   Well, maybe if we don't look at it that way, but look at it in terms of views, it is one
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.960]   of the top viewed videos on YouTube.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.280]   People are talking about it.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:15.720]   They put it on the opening game of football means a lot of people, so 30 million people
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.720]   saw it.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.080]   I just, what are 30 million?
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.000]   I guess what's interesting, right?
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.320]   To take a step from deconstruction of moving the reader response theory where the efforts
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:30.920]   of the creator don't matter, you know, what are people carrying away from this other than
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.600]   Microsoft apparently has so much money.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.840]   They don't invest in satellites.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.840]   They invest in really random, mini-television.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:37.840]   So, like television.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840]   No, you know what I mean?
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.880]   I mean, can you imagine if you turn this in, you know, Ryan and your lip professors would
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.440]   savage this, you know what I mean?
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.440]   I have very likely.
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.440]   What's that?
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.320]   Although my professors probably would not have approved of me going into gadget journalism
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.480]   either, so you know, you've got to be out and think it's...
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:00.400]   Look, I wrote for magazines before I ended up in television, so I've twice peed upon
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:04.240]   all that was sacred from a lot of my college professors because they thought magazines
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.160]   were a low excuse for the use of the language.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:12.000]   I'm with you there, but I just look at this and it's like, whoa, I...
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   It's going to take a lot to tie this in this.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.440]   Look, I mean, it's not a joyce in material here, okay?
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:19.040]   I mean, we're not talking about interpreting Ulysses.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.040]   I mean, this is...
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.040]   I'm not talking about interpreting Ulysses.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.880]   I think it's higher-brow than most commercials if you want to look at an interpretive standpoint,
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:27.880]   but it's...
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:28.880]   I mean, this is not...
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.880]   I think sophomoric.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.880]   Given the resources they had available...
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:32.880]   I agree.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.200]   I think it is totally sophomoric.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.640]   It's a high-brow, hardly.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.760]   I mean, yeah, maybe if you could take that interpretive aspect that you were using, Ryan,
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.920]   and take it right to the end and have everything nailed down, but you started off with a pretty
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.280]   interesting interpretation, but then you did all this...
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.520]   There's too many loose ends.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:55.240]   So now I'm like going back to the fact that I think that adds so totally stinks, and I
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.240]   have a prediction, which is I think they're going to kill this campaign before they get
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.240]   to the punchline.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.240]   Let me ask you this.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.800]   The LA Times said, "The most disturbing part of the commercial begins with the cut to the
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.680]   Latino family, standing outside the store looking in through the window as they, too,
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.680]   eat churros."
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.440]   "A sel con quístador?"
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440]   The woman says.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.600]   The man replies in Spanish, "They run tight."
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.880]   There are English subtitles.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.600]   These dark-skinned people stand close together and have befuddled expressions on their faces.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.760]   They seem to take shoe circuits very seriously.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.800]   Perhaps they're supposed to represent the consumers around the globe that Microsoft's
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:35.200]   trying to reconnect with, but the depiction seems condescending and borderline offensive.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.240]   They say, "What are these rich guys doing shopping at shoe circuits?"
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.640]   Well, the third world looks in through the window.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.640]   I think the LA...
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.640]   That's a good point.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.640]   I like that.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.880]   It tastes kind of savage.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.960]   The Latinos are pressed up against the glass fascinated by the action inside, but they do
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.200]   not appear to know who Gates and Seinfeld are.
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.000]   Are they too poor to own a TV?
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.960]   Do they represent the yearning Latino hordes trying to get in on the American consumers'
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960]   dream?
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:06.040]   Well, actually, that's a good point because the commercial clearly indicates that Bill
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:11.080]   Gates is playing Bill Gates and Seinfeld's playing Seinfeld because they mention each
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.080]   other's names.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.480]   So those people in the window are obviously so out of touch or they don't have TVs or
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:21.120]   they don't care or know anything about anything, which is kind of insulting to an entire ethnic
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.120]   group.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.120]   Right, yeah, John.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.760]   And not that they just did that for the comedic value.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:25.760]   Maybe it's your comedy.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:30.360]   Well, yeah, if there was a comedic value, I didn't think it was funny about it.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360]   I don't know.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.360]   I found that that part was humorous.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.840]   Yeah, I would agree that I think it's possible to interpret that a little bit strangely, but
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:41.040]   at the same time, I mean, look, you're also talking to me, if you want to speak in all
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.120]   these metaphors and whatnot, I mean, you're talking about the man who is doing more to
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:49.960]   better the world than most governments possibly combined.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:59.560]   I mean, this is a person who the philanthropic efforts of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.680]   are completely off the charts by comparison to those things.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.160]   So for that reason, we should like this commercial.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.360]   No, that's not a safe brown people in the world.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.480]   Trying to drive a particular point.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:15.160]   My point is you can interpret that a lot of different ways with the minority group standing
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.080]   outside the window and what have you.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.440]   I don't really think that that's what they were after at all though.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:24.360]   A bit into the ad sign for this is a great review by Maria Russo in the LA Times a bit
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.960]   into the ad Seinfeld suddenly takes over from the salesman and is helping fit Gates'
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.200]   shoes.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.200]   As Seinfeld feels around for Gates, to he says, "Is that your toe?"
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.240]   Gates says, "No," Seinfeld asks, "What is it?"
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.080]   Gates says, "Leather."
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:43.760]   The camera lingers on Gates face as he says, "Leather," and he appears to be attempting
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.280]   to give a meaningful look.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.800]   Are we supposed to be interpreting something naughty in this exchange?
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:53.040]   It's not unreasonable to go there, especially after we've witnessed the fondling of Gates'
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.160]   feet by a kneeling Seinfeld.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:02.240]   At the very end, she says, "It's main idea is a dadaist void.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.720]   A decade after Seinfeld, nothing has gotten old."
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.200]   Yeah, I have to agree with her on that.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.040]   All right, so you liked it, Ryan.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.520]   I would say I'm not a big fan.
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.200]   I can think John is not a big fan.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.400]   You're going to have to, Patrick, it's up to you to cast the deciding vote.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.240]   I want to, can I hold casting my vote until I've seen the entire thing?
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.240]   I think we need to see more, too.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.040]   I think we need to see episode 2, 3, 4.
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:29.280]   It might end up being the most brilliant ad campaign ever.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.000]   Begun with a subtle way.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.400]   Microsoft has never done a memorable ad campaign in its history.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.800]   Why would this be any different?
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:41.200]   Well, it's certainly not from anything Microsoft's ever done.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.400]   I actually think the Mojave one was pretty fascinating.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.480]   They dropped that, haven't they?
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:46.360]   That's over.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.360]   Still online.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.000]   That was another blunder.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.520]   If people who I don't exist, do they like it?
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:58.680]   To take a more literalist approach, which I'll back off on the Mexican thing for Ryan's
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:05.920]   benefit, I think the joke about the toe leather was just a nerd, which is nerd humor.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:06.920]   Yeah, just non-sequitur.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:07.920]   What am I feeling there?
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.280]   You're pushing on it, because he says, "Is this your toe?"
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.280]   But he's not pushing on his toe.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.280]   He's pushing on the shoe, which is leather.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.280]   Oh, I get it.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.280]   Right.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.280]   Get it?
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.360]   I'm getting literalist engineer humor.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.360]   Well, it is?
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.920]   And then the furtive look between the two of them was them exchanging the fact that it
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.160]   was a punchline to a stupid joke.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.320]   I would have loved to have been at this shooting and this thing.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:37.360]   And I'm actually just curious, can you name just from my own personal edification a couple
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.560]   of things that you've actually thought were funny?
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.360]   Like movies, television shows, stuff like that?
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:45.280]   John, I was a big fan of the Seinfeld show.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.280]   I love it.
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:49.680]   I think Larry David show is less funny, because it's not scripted.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.680]   Right.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.680]   And so I think it falls off.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:56.320]   It sends to shouting a lot, which is kind of the failure of bad, bad improv to shouting.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.320]   I'm just curious.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.080]   I just want to kind of understand your taste a little bit more.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.960]   And this is just for me, as a colleague, I see around a lot and stuff like that.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.640]   So next time I know what kind of joke to tell.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.080]   So when you want to ask him to a movie and a churro, you'll know.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.880]   I can tell you what kind of joke to tell.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.480]   No, actually, I don't want to know that.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.080]   I want to know first what kind of movie I--
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.480]   No, what kind of joke to tell?
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.480]   Funny joke.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.480]   So--
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.480]   Very circular.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   Very circular.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.480]   So--
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.480]   No, I tell a joke.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.480]   Tell a joke, John.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.480]   Something you think is funny.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.480]   Let's hear it.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.480]   No, let's start telling jokes.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.080]   No, I want you to tell a joke.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.080]   You must have a joke.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.480]   I can't ever remember a joke.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.480]   Are you like that?
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.480]   Or do you actually have jokes that you tell?
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.480]   Like when you go on the golf course, you tell a joke.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.480]   Yeah, when I'm on the golf course.
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.280]   And when I frequent the golf course, I'm pressing my lines.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.880]   You don't-- so are you a joke teller, John?
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:40.880]   I don't think you are.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.880]   I have jokes.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.880]   I have a lot of jokes, actually.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:44.880]   OK, let's hear your--
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.280]   No, I'm not going to start doing a monologue here.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.280]   Oh, I put that all 30.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.280]   That's the session.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.280]   Do a dog.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.280]   I'm going to answer Ryan's question with some stuff.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.280]   Ryan, you're a tire Red Fox record.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.680]   Ryan, you don't have to tell a joke, John?
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:01.280]   By the way, Ryan, now talking about Red Fox, and I keep telling people this who like to
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:05.280]   collect records, Red Fox at one point did all these party records.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:07.280]   He's 30--
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.280]   --and he's almost impossible to find nowadays.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.280]   And he must have done 50 of them.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.280]   Yeah.

[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.280]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.280]   It's on the can.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.280]   That's it.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.280]   The show's over.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:53.280]   Thank you very much, everybody.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:58.280]   Hey, I do want to-- I do want to-- I'm a little slow off the draw, but--
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.280]   There you go.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.280]   Thank you very much.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280]   Nice.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.280]   Ryan Block is starting something brand new, something very exciting.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.280]   GDGT.com, the place to go.
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.280]   The podcast is on iTunes right now doing very well.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.280]   Just go to technology and look for the number one show.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.280]   You son of a gun.
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.280]   GDGT.com.
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:19.280]   No, you and Peter, anything you do is going to be golden.
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:20.280]   I'm very excited.
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:21.280]   I can't wait.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:23.280]   Do you have an estimated launch time?
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:26.280]   You know we're saying soon, but not too soon.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:27.280]   I don't know.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.280]   I don't want to start the ticket launch.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.280]   When it's done.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.280]   I understand that.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280]   I understand that.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.280]   I'd rather make sure it was good and ready.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:39.280]   That's why we want to do the podcast versus to give something,
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:44.280]   put something out there in the time in between when I left in gadget
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:47.280]   and when we actually get it at the door.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.280]   Good.
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:49.280]   I can't wait.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.280]   I'm only looking forward to it.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:53.280]   I think the world of the two of you and I'm sure anything you do is going to be very interesting.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.280]   Patrick Norton is on Techzilla and System.

[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.280]   Thank you, sir.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.280]   And everything going great there, yes?
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:05.280]   It's going good actually.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.280]   Having a lot of fun this week.
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:10.280]   We had some $200 GPS, like a mini $200 GPS roundup.
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.280]   We finally got in a bunch of people asking as they were going back to school about the
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.280]   modbook, the tablet-tized Macintosh.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.280]   That's really cool, yeah.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   Yeah, but I don't --
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.280]   Well, save your review for the show.

[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   I'm going to go prime off your lenses.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.280]   No, he can have those CDs.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.280]   I didn't need those.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.280]   It was the lens box I was worried about next to them.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.280]   It's empty.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.280]   And of course, John C. Devorak.org/blog.

[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.280]   Guys, I thank you.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.280]   Patrick said it best when he said, "Love the Twitches and the Candles."
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280]   See you next week.

[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.280]   But the cutest kid I ever saw in my life.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:19.280]   Man, there's a slight lag.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.280]   You should slide.
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.280]   It's about five seconds.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.280]   Sure thing.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:28.280]   Yeah, oh, is he the cutest?
