[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   It's time for this weekend tech.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   I'm Tom Erich, filling in for the vacationing Leo LaPorte.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   Last we saw he was being denied landing in Antarctica.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   First let's introduce our panel for this weekend joining us from revision3.com's techzilla show as well as core on the Sony PlayStation Network.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   And co-host of Sword and Laser with me, Veronica Belmont.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   Hello, thank you for having me.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   Yeah, thanks for being on the show. I know you've been traveling a bunch.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   Yeah, happy to be home and happy to be able to do the show. Sorry I couldn't make it into the Twit cottage.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   I was just too much traveling, too tired.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   Also from the Houston Chronicle, Mr. Dwight Silverman just recently had you on Tech News today.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   Great to have you on Twit now.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   Yeah, good to see you again and happy to be on Twit as always.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   And I love being on with John and Veronica. This should be a lot of fun.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   And there you go. That is our final man, Mr. John C. Devorak last, but certainly not least.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   It's a pleasure once again to be doing Twit.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   I just got back from Tahiti.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   Yeah, I see. Is that where you got that shirt?
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   No.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   Did you get that shirt at Walmart?
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   Because I'm usually shopping at Walmart.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   You know, over at Oakland.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   Yeah, in Oakland.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   Right off the 280 or the 880.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   You seem to know where it is.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   Right near the in and out.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   This is Twit. And this week we've got a lot of announcements coming.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   I wanted to give a little peek into the week ahead.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   Mobile World Congress is kicking off in Barcelona right now.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   Actually, there've been press announcements already today from Samsung, Sony and Nokia.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   Tomorrow, LG is expected to announce their 3D smartphone.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   That'll be a 2am Pacific if you'd like to get up and see.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   Does anybody need a 3D smartphone?
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   That's just giving me.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   I thought those phones were 3D.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   I mean, I've never seen one, a two dimensional phone.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   Well, that new Samsung Galaxy S2 is very thin.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   So maybe it's...
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   Maybe they're thinking that...
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   Trying to play off that.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   Also, Microsoft's Steve Balmer will be speaking at Mobile World Congress.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   That'll be at 7am.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   It's trying to explain away the Nokia deal.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   Well, Nokia had their shot at it today.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   So it's a one-two punch.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   Non-Movall World Congress News.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   Monday through Wednesday this week is when IBM's Watson takes on the Jeopardy champs.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   Great.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   So this is the Computer versus Man trivia contest.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   It's going to be a bloodbath.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   Watson's going to kill, right?
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   You think so?
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   I think you could jam and nut...
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   Well, you know, if they did it right, because I don't know if you've known anyone who's ever been on the Jeopardy show.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   But I've known two people.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   I have known one person.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   And you ask them about it.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   Before you go on the show, they kind of first find out what your interests are.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   So they're not going to ask you strange things about Greek history.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   And then they kind of talk about kinds of general things that everyone should kind of know about.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   So they kind of give you a hint as to what direction the show is.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   They don't give you the answers or questions, but they kind of let you know kind of where it's going.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   So if they do that with the Watson to make things fair, in other words, tell the computer what they're going to talk about.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   The computer could load up with every trivia about whatever, and there's no way that you can beat the computer in that regard.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   I have a feeling they're not going to do it that way.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   I bet they'll probably just ask a lot of generalized questions.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   And then the computer just knows so much off the top.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   It's more about the way they ask the questions.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.400]   It has to kind of parse the English and try to figure it out, because a lot of the questions are like riddles, right?
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   They're not just strange.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   The riddles are the...
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   Yeah, right.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   ... were straight questions about history.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.400]   Or there's a rhyme involved.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   I hope that the computer fails to answer the question in the form of a question.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   Now that would be great.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   Sorry, Watson, but you did not answer that.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   And then the computer would go, "What? I don't know what you're talking about."
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   And it would do the one small programming error.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   Syntax error.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   Does that compute?
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   It would start smoking.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   Why would I answer questions with a question?
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   The computer actually.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   And it may not change.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   And the button pushing thing?
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   Don't you have to be the first to push the button, right?
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   That's true, right?
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   Yeah, how does the computer push the button?
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   First it has to know the answer, and meanwhile it's digging through the...
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   So it sounds like the computer has an unfair advantage here, because...
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   I think it's got an unfair advantage.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   They're probably not going to...
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   Like you said, they're probably not going to narrow the fields for Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, because the computer has all fields.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Right.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   And then the computer has the ability to just trigger the button remotely.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   I mean, I mean, I know that second.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   Yeah, it's extremely fast, of course.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   So there's that.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   But don't, you know, give Ken Jennings a chance.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   He's the smart guy that Ken...
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   I think...
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400]   When is this going to be...
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   This starts Monday, and then it runs through Wednesday.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   It's going to be the whole week is going to be...
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   Or this couple episodes are going to be right.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   Okay, good.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   I may actually watch that.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   It's worth putting on your DVR, just to fast forward through, if nothing else.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   Tuesday, more mobile world congress announcements from HTC.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   We've seen a lot of stuff from HTC in the past couple months.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   I'm not sure that we're expecting anything huge from them.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   Has anybody heard anything in the rumor pipeline?
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   No.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   Wednesday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation turns 21.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   Oh, I can drink now.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   It's adorable.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   Also, the House Subcommittee is scheduling their net neutrality hearings to begin Wednesday.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   This is where Congress attempts to stop the FCC from implementing their guidelines.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   That going to happen?
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.400]   This going to be fun to watch.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   Should everyone try and see it, man?
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   I don't like getting you there.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   I don't like getting you there.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   I think the government's getting involved in...
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.840]   It was when I'm not about this net neutrality thing, but I'm totally convinced that once
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.560]   the government gets involved, they're going to start to regulate the internet in such
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.280]   a way that it's not going to be a good thing.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.200]   EFF agrees with you, actually.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.640]   They're kind of like, "We believe in net neutrality, but we're not sure that we need the government
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.200]   to come in and enforce it."
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.400]   I personally think we need more competition, and that will ensure net neutrality.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.160]   Because people would rather go with your thinking than the current thinking.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   Finally, Thursday, the HP Pre-2 that was announced.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   We'll talk a little bit more about that later.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.360]   We'll be available for pre-order for $100 on Verizon.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.360]   Will there be lines?
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.200]   So now, give us the price again?
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   $100.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.880]   $100 for what?
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.360]   For the HP Pre-2.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   And so for what?
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.880]   Fifty bucks should you get two of them?
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   Yes.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.880]   Second prize, two pre-tudes.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.360]   They're selling it unlocked, too.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.800]   How much are they selling it unlocked for?
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   You know what?
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   I don't have the price.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   Now you're talking.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   I think it's something like, if I remember, I'd have something like $450.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   It's kind of high.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.920]   But it's not that different from the original Pre-2.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.000]   I don't understand what the draw is, particularly when they've got the Pre-Qbed and the Vere
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   coming out later.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.200]   So I don't know what the draw is.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.600]   Yeah, I still don't know anyone with a Pre, but maybe my circle of friends is just not.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.400]   I don't see guys with a Pre-2 target.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   I don't know.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   It's a decent phone, though.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.800]   I mean, it's not a bad phone, and that's a good price point.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.400]   That's a pretty solid price point for it.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.840]   I know two guys with a Pre, both of them have taken it, have had to go back multiple times
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.760]   to get the hardware replaced.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.680]   And the screen is just replacing it.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.280]   You bring it in, and it's broken or cracked, or particularly the slider gets real loose,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.520]   and they're just giving them back out again.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.400]   So I'm not a big believer in it.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.960]   It looks like it's not very well made.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.880]   Hopefully the Pre-2 will be a little better.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.880]   I don't know.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.880]   All right, let's go with the Mobile World Congress announcements that came today.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.200]   Samsung did exactly what everyone expected.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.280]   They announced a tablet and a new Galaxy S phone.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.080]   The new tablet is a Galaxy Tab.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.640]   Well, they didn't call it the Galaxy Tab 2.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.240]   They call it the Galaxy Tab 10.1.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   Claim.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.680]   After the screen size, 10.1 inch.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   Oh, interesting.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:17.280]   It'll have Tegra 2 inside, Honeycomb, dual cameras, so two megapixels on the front, eight
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.600]   megapixels on the back.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.280]   All in all, the specs sound pretty much like every other Android tablet I've heard announced.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.280]   So, OK.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.280]   Next.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.440]   Oh, I think it's a solid competitor to the iPad, though.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   I think it's a good device.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   Oh, you're just being nice.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.440]   It's going to be a really good device.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.440]   It's going to be nice.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.440]   It's being nice.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.640]   Give them a chance.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.040]   I mean, come on.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.960]   It's got the Tegra 2 is really fast.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.080]   It's got it, you know, it's got a solid design.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.080]   You never know.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.280]   That may be a sponsor sometime in the future.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.280]   Go live with them.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.280]   Go live with these guys.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.560]   I mean, you never know.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.600]   It doesn't, none of it matters till we see the pricing on it, because if it can't, you
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.560]   know, if it can't compete with the iPad and pricing, you know, consumers are not going
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.400]   to go for it in droves, the disaster of the Zoom pricing is a good thing.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.440]   What are they thinking over there?
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.480]   Well, you know, there was that Best Buy page that went up with a price at $11.99, $1.99,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.440]   and then very quickly Best Buy yanked it down and said that was a placeholder price.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.160]   It's not going to be that pricey, but $800 seems to be the consensus of what the system
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.160]   is.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160]   That's still too high, isn't it?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   Yeah, it is too.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.160]   It is too much.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   It's a lot of money.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.600]   I'd be excited about the 8 megapixel camera on the, on the tab.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.560]   That's really the only differentiator there.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.680]   It's got a, it's got a pretty nice, well, I don't even know if it's a nice camera.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.680]   It's got more megapixels.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.080]   That doesn't necessarily mean it.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:44.200]   Samsung is a notorious company for having lousy cameras, which is funny because didn't they
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.800]   have the first 8 and 10 megapixel camera phones?
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   They need all those.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.360]   They need tons and tons of pixels because of the blurry quality of the lenses and the
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   rest of it.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.360]   I think that's the reason.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.520]   But who the hell needs that many pixels?
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:03.560]   If I told you that this was a Tegra 2 tablet, 16 gig or 32 gig with Android 3.0 honeycomb
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.920]   on it and didn't tell you it was the tab.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   Sounds good to me.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.920]   You wouldn't know it.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.440]   You wouldn't know it was any different from any other tablet out there.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   I would.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.440]   I would differentiate it on price point.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.240]   I have a feeling.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.680]   The other thing they announced was the Samsung Galaxy S2, a dual core phone, 1 gigahertz
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.920]   CPU, 4.3 inch super AMOLED plus screen.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.480]   And we, as we mentioned earlier, extraordinarily thin.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.280]   Everybody's raving about how it just kind of disappears in the hand.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.800]   I believe Chris Ziegler from Engadget cut himself on it.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.960]   He was bleeding out of control.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960]   It was awful.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.800]   No, the shell measures 8.49 millimeters, making it probably the thinnest smartphone that's
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   been put out yet.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   I like that.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.040]   You can also use it as a weapon.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.280]   That's right.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.280]   You flick it.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   You can.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.280]   You can.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   You can get something stuck in your teeth.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   You can just use it that way.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.640]   Use the glossy finish on the back.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.280]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.920]   Is it running 2, 2 or 2, 3?
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.320]   You know, I'm looking for that.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.240]   I think I recall seeing something that it was going to come out with 2, 2 when it comes
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   up.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   And I'm not, I may be confusing that with one of the other announcements today.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.640]   Yeah, I hope I'm better at updating it.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.640]   I hope they're better at updating it.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.640]   You chaff room is saying 2, 3.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   OK, it's 2, 3.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.640]   You're right.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   2, 3.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   Oh, that's good.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   OK.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640]   Because they've just been Samsung's been awful about, you know, updating its, the galaxy
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   line of phones.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.360]   And that's been a really problem with Android.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.680]   And I hope that they do better at it starting with this one.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.160]   Has anybody on the show here have one of these Samsung phones or any sort of Samsung phone
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.160]   ever?
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.200]   Yeah, we have the Nexus S, which is a galaxy phone.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.360]   Oh, right.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   Eileen uses it.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.080]   So I get to play around with it sometimes.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.080]   It's a nice phone.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.080]   It's a great phone.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.040]   Any of the faults of the Nexus S in my mind are faults of Android, not faults of the
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.040]   phone.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040]   Phone works great.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.800]   Well, the Nexus S doesn't have a front facing camera though, which I kind of wish
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.960]   it did.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.400]   It's a really, it's a great, the Galaxy S cameras are nice.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.840]   They've got these odd little glitches that I, that most of them have been fixed.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.440]   Like it came out with terrible GPS initially.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.720]   GPS couldn't connect and hold.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.200]   The chat rooms, I'm sorry, but the chat rooms got a bunch of these phones.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   They love them.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.440]   Yeah, people have a love them.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.280]   People have a love them.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:24.760]   Also the, the touch whiz interface is Samsung's modified Android interface might be coming
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.000]   on this as well, which could not ruin it, but that could change a lot of people's minds.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.600]   A lot of people just want the generic interface.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   Nexus S has a front facing camera.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   Oh, it does?
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.160]   So says Eileen from the other room and she's got one on her hand.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.640]   So I tend to believe she's like, yeah.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   All right.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.960]   Sony also had their mobile world Congress announcement today as well.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.240]   The Sony Erickson Xperia Pro was announced.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.040]   The Sony Erickson Neo was announced, but the, the star of the show was something we've
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.560]   pretty much seen everything about the Sony Erickson Xperia play, which is the first
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.240]   phone to have the PlayStation mobile suite in it.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.080]   It's essentially going to be the, the flagship for that experience.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.200]   And everybody's got their hands on it out there seems to be saying nice things about it.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:20.960]   Maybe they're just full of ham own and Java, but, but everybody says the buttons feel good.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.160]   It's fun to play on and they've got some good titles to launch with.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.520]   Yeah, there's going to be a lot of big titles on there.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.320]   I'm just curious to see what's going to be exclusive to the Xperia versus what's just
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.240]   going to be available on all Android phones.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.600]   I wonder if the, the, the interface will have any, not the interface, but rather the, the
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.360]   buttons in the control scheme will have any effect on what titles get, get shipped on
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.440]   Xperia versus other Android devices.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.440]   Right.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.080]   Because the PlayStation suite will be available for all Android phones.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.160]   They announced today that the system will ship with asphalt adrenaline six, Bruce Lee,
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.960]   star battalion, the Sims three and Tetris, along with a quote legendary PlayStation title,
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.160]   which would be what's the big, what's the big PlayStation title that would be legendary?
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.160]   One of the big ones.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   Does anybody know?
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160]   It may not have worked.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.680]   I have no insider knowledge on this, by the way.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.480]   I'm totally just making stuff up.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.800]   Um, yeah, I don't know.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.280]   Angry birds for the PlayStation.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.040]   Well, yeah, I mean, let's say that it's sonic for Sega.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.080]   It's Mario for Nintendo.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.760]   It's Halo for, for Xbox.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.360]   What would be the legendary Sony PS?
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.160]   We're not big gamers, apparently.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.160]   We'd know.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   I know.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.160]   I mean, the chat.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160]   Final fantasy.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160]   Everybody might guess.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.160]   Final fantasy.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   Maybe.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.880]   You could be final fantasy.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.160]   That's a good guess too.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.160]   Ratchet and clank.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.160]   Ratchet and clank.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.160]   What's that?
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.160]   What's that?
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160]   Everyone's saying middle gear solid.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.160]   They're saying two.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.660]   What is the game?
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.720]   It was initially available only on the PlayStation where you kind of rolled junk and make a bigger
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   ball.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   Adamari.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.720]   That would be interesting on a phone.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   That would be interesting.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.320]   That was on an Nintendo game.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:07.640]   Internal like the accelerator and the gyroscope, gyroscopic like internal accelerator, you know,
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.520]   to roll the ball around and catch things up in the Katamari ball.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.520]   I remember that.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.520]   No one's doing this.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.520]   No one's doing this.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.520]   No one's doing this.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.520]   No one's doing this.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.520]   I like that game.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   That would be great.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.120]   We're all too busy looking at the specs of the Sony Ericsson play.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.120]   We're all online.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.120]   Here's pathetic.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120]   We're all I aming people.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.800]   What kind of a show is this Tony upstairs says Gran Turismo.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   It could be.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.800]   We could.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.920]   You know, it's like it's like it would have to look really good for Gran Turismo to be
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.920]   to be it.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.680]   Well, and they're already doing the asphalt racing game.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.440]   How about Grand Theft Auto on the play?
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.440]   HTA.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.520]   Which may be great because you'd be sitting there on an airplane playing this thing and
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.160]   you're there's you like bashing a hooker, you know, John, your knowledge of video games
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   is impressing me.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.200]   I have to say, I'm very impressed right now.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.080]   Are you a big GT5 player GT4?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.160]   No, I don't even know what I'm talking about to be honest about it.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.320]   I'm just saying words.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.080]   They sound like they're from video games.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   Just words.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.200]   Are we impressed with either of these other phones?
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.520]   The Xperia Pro is a slider device with a full-quality keyboard 3.7 inch screen gigahertz Snapdragon
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.840]   CPU gingerbread Android 2.3.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.440]   I think another 8 megapixel camera this time from Sony though.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.640]   I think the more interesting story is this is this Nokia deal.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.840]   It's the Neo is the the only thing we didn't talk about.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   That's the Sony miniature phone.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.480]   It's not quite a feature phone, but it's a more affordable smartphone.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.920]   It's like a Neo node as a matter of fact.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.920]   You don't have a copy of it there though.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.920]   Is that it?
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.920]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.560]   Oh, well Neo node was half that size.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.520]   It's a little bigger than that.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.120]   All right, let's move on to the Nokia.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.200]   I had their announcement today as well and their announcement involved no phones.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.640]   It was Stephen Elop on stage defending the decision they announced on Friday to partner
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.960]   up with Windows Phone 7 as their future strategy.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.960]   Yeah, there's a classic.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   Did you watch the whole thing?
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.080]   I watched the entire event.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.080]   I watched most of it.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.880]   I had it on while I was working, so I missed a few pieces over here.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.880]   I'll tell you.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.760]   I took some notes of course I didn't bring it with me.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.800]   You know, I think for one thing, Elop is very much he's got the same cadence and style
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.320]   of Bill Gates when he speaks.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:24.000]   And there's a certain cadence that comes out of Microsoft that is just Microsofty.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.040]   And I've run into a bunch of these guys and they come out of Microsoft as executives and
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.960]   they go to other companies and they do the same thing.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.480]   They have all these ideas and they think they're going to be successful with them.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.720]   But I'm always thinking they never seem to get it that when they were at Microsoft they're
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.200]   a part of an anomaly company that really didn't have to do a lot of original thinking.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.040]   And they didn't have to make the right decision.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.360]   The right decision at Microsoft was let's don't kill Office.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   And let's don't kill Windows.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.280]   And that's the only decision you have to make.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.440]   Anything else you do is just, you know, is gravy.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.840]   And do you think this is not a good idea?
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.360]   I'm, yeah, I think it's not a good idea.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   I think they should have at least, although nobody asked the question, I was very disappointed
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.600]   in the media because they didn't ask the question of the, of Elop whether or not they
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.280]   kept the option for Android Open.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.880]   He did mention that they're keeping me.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   It doesn't sound that way.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.400]   It doesn't sound that way, but he did keep the MIGO option open.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.880]   So it's a possibility.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.600]   What they did is they said, we're going to partner up with Microsoft.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.000]   They're going to give us Windows Phone 7.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.800]   We're going to give them Navtech mapping.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.240]   And it's going to be a tight partnership.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.240]   We'll be able to actually change the interface, which nobody else has been able to do.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.040]   Symbian becomes what they call a franchise platform, which I guess is Finnish for, we're
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   phasing it out.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.400]   Right, exactly.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.800]   And then MIGO becomes a research and development platform.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.760]   They're going to put out one MIGO device this year and he keeps saying, it kept saying
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.600]   today in his announcement, and it's going to be the disruptive platform of the future.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   I don't know.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.520]   We're saving it for disruptive stuff.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.920]   I don't know what that means at all.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.040]   Well, the other thing, anyway, there's a couple things going on in Finland.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.240]   There's a walk out at a couple of the factories.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.560]   The employees are irked about this guy and the whole process.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:09.440]   And there's a term going around the, around Finland called Goof, a GOOF and it refers to
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:16.360]   get out of Finland because everybody believes that Microsoft is either going to do a deal
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:23.480]   and either buy most of Nokia and outsource it to China and pretty much closed down, killing
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.040]   150,000 jobs in Finland.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.600]   This is what they believe at in Finland.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:34.240]   And so this is problematic because if you bend to Finland or if you study how the Finns
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:40.760]   think, it doesn't really, it's not very compatible with Microsoft the way they think in Redmond,
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   Washington.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.200]   It's just this culturally different.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   I think this guy should have taken a little more cultural answer.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   I apologize.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   I think there's a lot of issues here.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.520]   I think this is going to be fun to watch what happens.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.320]   I mean, I hope they're successful, but I doubt if they will be.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   And I also think they're going to-
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:00.160]   I'm just surprised because I think it's, if Nokia doesn't evolve in this way, there's
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.520]   no way they're going to stay alive.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:08.080]   I mean, Microsoft excels at getting their software out on devices, whether it's Windows
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.640]   or Windows Phone 7 or whatever platform they're trying to spread across the world.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.040]   That's what they do best.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.800]   And Nokia has been making hardware forever and they make more hardware for phones than
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.200]   I think anyone else in the world at this point.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.800]   So the idea of getting Windows Phone 7 on Nokia devices across the world, I think it
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.360]   makes perfect sense for both brands.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.000]   It may not be good for the people in Finland, but-
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Well, here's a-
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I'm going to ask a couple of questions then.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.200]   One, why can't they do the same thing with Android, which has apps and we're in the
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.320]   world of apps and Microsoft has none.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.000]   They have 8,000 I think.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.760]   They're growing apps though and they're going to absorb all the apps from the end to their
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   store also.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760]   It's weak.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:53.720]   Anyway, your argument, how would that not apply exactly the same way to Android?
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.000]   Without the royalties that you have to pay Microsoft for the operating system, which adds
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   to the bottom line.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.680]   Well, they tried to go to Android and it didn't work out.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.880]   They couldn't work out a deal.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.960]   They said that Microsoft has offered them billions of dollars.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.440]   Wow, that's always the place.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.120]   And they said that they couldn't work out a deal with Android.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.080]   And then today, Elop said, our first priority is beating Android, which sounds to be like
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.200]   somebody who got pissed off over negotiations and is turning against them.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.000]   Although they also said that they didn't want to take Android because it would make
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.200]   Android too big.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.360]   Well, there's another element.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.480]   There's a political element, the European Union specifically made a big stink about,
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:38.720]   oh, God, if these guys go to Android, there's going to be a duopoly with Apple and Android
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.120]   and we can't have that because we know the EU hates American companies to begin with.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.760]   Of course, in Microsoft, they hate them too, but what else could they do?
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.520]   I think they should have maybe done something, I don't know, but maybe altogether different
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.080]   which they're not going to.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:58.800]   Here's what the problem is as far as I'm concerned is that the Windows 7 phone straight up in
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:05.960]   straight competition with Android and the iPhone shows no traction.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:11.200]   Now, well, I mean, I'm just reading the monthly numbers.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.160]   Apparently they sold a whole bunch of phones right off the bat and then the thing went
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.360]   dead flat after they filled the channel up.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360]   They've released any numbers.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   They haven't released any numbers.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.040]   No, there's some research companies that have said, I'll have to dig in.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.800]   I'm going to get this up now, apparently, to back up my own story.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:31.160]   When Microsoft has a hit, they release numbers and they trumpet them and they have not released
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.840]   any numbers here.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.160]   I think that they are not selling these at all.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.360]   When you use one of these phones, when you use a Windows phone, it's a great phone to
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.520]   use it.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:47.920]   The problem is that no one's going to try it in the era of Android and in the era of
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.560]   the iPhone.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.760]   I don't know necessarily that the race is over, but you've got two people who basically,
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.280]   two companies that in terms of mobile, have become clueless and they're drowning and
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.040]   they're trying to cling to each other in order to survive.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.760]   There's no indication that they'll do better together than they would have separately.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.920]   They won't be any faster.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.920]   They won't be any more agile and they're not going to have the same kind of mind share
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.680]   that Android and Apple do at the moment.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.800]   I disagree on that because I think, like I said earlier, Nokia makes really good hardware
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.720]   and they've got the reach worldwide and Windows makes good mobile software, I think
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   so anyway.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.240]   I think the combination is actually a really good fit and I think it makes the most sense
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.240]   for both of them to go into a partnership together and their powers combined, their
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.280]   Captain's cell phone, I don't know.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.640]   Nokia didn't do a great job of making smartphones these days that people really fell in love
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.840]   with and maybe with the combination of Windows Phone 7 it will be something that they can
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.400]   do going forward because I mean there aren't going to be feature phones or the way of the
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   pass.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:59.280]   Smartphones and even lower price smartphones going forward and Windows, Microsoft can
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.560]   make that happen for them.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.920]   Well like the Indians like to say two turkeys don't make an eagle.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.080]   That was Vikbondatra from Google.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.400]   That's right, the Google guy.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.040]   Which I think he is Indian by the same.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.200]   It could be but I said Egyptian Indian.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.240]   Veronica will tell but I think that you're barking up the wrong tree with this thinking.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   I think you are.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.440]   Yeah I know what you think I am.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.320]   Obviously I'll play Peacemaker.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:37.440]   Veronica has a point in that the way where smartphones are going is the cheap feature
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.600]   phones are going to replace by cheap smartphones.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   Yep.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.600]   That too.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:51.800]   And so everybody says that that at that point if Microsoft and Nokia execute well they can
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   pull it off.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.360]   The problem is and this is what I said is that they have not executed well on either
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:04.040]   of these lately up to now and whether they can do it together is a big question.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.480]   They can't be agile and they can't be too big.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.080]   Is the problem with the Nokia N95 and the N97 the operating system or the hardware?
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.760]   I think it's the operating system or anything.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.040]   If it's more than the operating system then I think Windows Phone could help save them.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   Yeah the hardware is good.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   If it's hardware problem.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.880]   Hardware is fine but the point is people don't make these associations.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.040]   They don't take a piece something that doesn't work and say well I think that the software
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.880]   is defective and the hardware is fantastic and I don't think people are even paying that
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   much attention to any of these phones anymore except for the fact that what they can do.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:44.320]   I think people are going for the buzz of hundreds of thousands of apps and the whole
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:51.160]   app idea has been kind of rejected by Nokia from the get go and it has largely by Microsoft
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.080]   it with their kind of defensive posture.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.600]   Well we got everything's included and we're doing it our own way and this app thing is
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.120]   overrated and all the rest of it because nobody and I say the same thing with Palm and the
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.120]   rest of these guys who don't have the apps.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.280]   But the reason that people make so many apps is because the devices are distributed over
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.800]   like millions of different people.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.560]   If Windows has the opportunity to get on more handsets then that means that more people
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.600]   are going to be willing to develop for Windows Phone 7 platform.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:22.080]   Well in your defense I will say this everyone that I've been in contact with that does apps
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:28.480]   they claim that the development kit for Windows Phone is better than anything ever done by
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.280]   anybody so you can really crank apps out.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.040]   But then again you know it's like at this point you got your little bit behind in this
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.600]   race it's like starting way late.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.920]   Yeah Microsoft is doing what Apple did at the beginning controlling the platform limiting
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   features.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.480]   Apple didn't allow third party apps at first Microsoft's at least allowing them but keeping
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:54.240]   a type control over it which okay that's all fine and that's all well and good but at this
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.480]   point you're four years behind the game.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.840]   So I'm not sure how fast you can catch up.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.200]   Microsoft's not known as a rabbit.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.000]   We're looking at another Microsoft Zoom possibly where they have Microsoft.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.560]   It's a fantastic product competitor for the iPod.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:15.600]   Yeah no it's a great bike and I think Veronica's being swayed by the fact and a lot of other
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.960]   people that this Windows Phone is a nice phone it works well it's just well designed
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.440]   it's a Zoom phone just like the Zoom.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.640]   But I think there's a jinx involved here these guys are too little too late they're not
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.600]   marketing this stuff right they have a bad reputation people actually want to hate
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.760]   them and I think it's doomed.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:39.440]   I think they've got a marketing problem and Nokia didn't any better at it than Microsoft
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.440]   did.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.600]   And they never will because they're finished.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   Finish guys.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   I mentioned the N97 and the N98 and other than kind of like the people on the show and geeks
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.160]   you know your mom doesn't know about the Nokia N97 and 98 they have no idea how to market
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   this stuff.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.560]   But they've heard of Nokia before.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.520]   I think it's Microsoft Mojo.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:07.960]   I think they've been terrible at trying to market the Windows Phone 7 and I think that
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.720]   probably the two of them together maybe they might make a complete marketer.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.720]   I don't know.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.200]   You know I think two turkeys do not make an eagle but two right.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.080]   Two bicycle makers can learn to fly.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.680]   That was Stephen Eelop's response by the way.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.640]   Two bicycle makers.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.080]   She's two Windows Phone 7 devices and one's a Nokia and one's an HTC which is one of
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.360]   my favorite manufacturers by the way.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   Which one is she going to pick?
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.320]   I mean Nokia's got this brand name recognition too that I think is really powerful and I
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.080]   think a lot of the general population is familiar with that brand and comfortable with it.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.680]   And if they want to get their first smartphone low price and smartphone maybe the Nokia
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   will be the choice for that.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.960]   I remember 15 years ago there was another big brand that had this fantastic reputation
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.360]   actually better than Nokia's at the time which was Ericsson.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.160]   And now they just partnered up with Sony.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.960]   They did the same thing they panicked and partnered with somebody that's not them.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.800]   But we just saw two great phones coming out on Sony Ericsson.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.760]   Yeah they're great but you know I'm telling you people they sell.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.480]   They'll buy an iPhone.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.400]   What do you use by the way Veronica?
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   iPhone.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.680]   I'm sorry I didn't hear you.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   What was that?
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.680]   iPhone.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   Okay just wondering.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:22.160]   Alright let's take a quick break and thank our sponsor Audible.com.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.880]   This week in Texas is brought to you by Audible.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   I use it.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:33.120]   I almost prefer and I say this hesitating to risk hypocrisy because I used to make fun
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.800]   of Leo when I would hear him say I almost prefer to use Audible books over reading.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.280]   But I actually now that I've been using Audible for a while I almost really do because I can
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.560]   read when I'm walking around.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.160]   I can read when I'm doing chores.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:51.440]   I like it when we get picks for Sword and Laser the show that Veronica and I do on Audible
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   because I read them faster.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   Have you noticed that Veronica?
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.000]   Oh yeah big time.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.920]   Yeah and all my commuting everything I do I'm listening to audiobooks now.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.400]   Right now the Sword and Laser pick I'm going to be selfish and use that as my example is
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.160]   the Shadow and Claw by Gene Wolf.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:13.280]   It's a fantastic book about a world near the end of its life and everything is so ancient
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.560]   that like rocket ships are now castles because the world is just kind of fallen back apart
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.560]   again.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:25.640]   Yeah that's not a big spoiler comes in like the first few pages.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   But now that you're spoiled you're going to have to read the rest of the book.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.720]   They sell it.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.120]   It was originally put out as written as two books.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.640]   The Shadow of the Torture and the Claw of the conciliator.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:42.920]   So it's two books on Audible which you can get for free by going to audible.com/twit2.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.240]   That's Twit and the number two.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.640]   Don't spell out two.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:51.440]   You can get two free audiobooks Audible of course a provider of over 85,000 downloadable
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   books.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.600]   They have magazine subscriptions.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600]   They have newspaper subscriptions.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.640]   You can have the New York Times read to you.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.360]   So check it out.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.800]   I'm going to recommend Gene Wolf.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.320]   Do you have another recommendation V or?
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.720]   No that's what I'm listening to right now as well so that's my pick.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.800]   What about you Dwight any audio books you have to recommend?
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:19.360]   You know I don't unfortunately I'm not an audio book listener but I do like I have listened
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.160]   in the past to Stephen King's Dark Tower series.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.160]   That's excellent.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.160]   I'm listening to that right now as well.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.000]   Just almost finished up with Wizarding Glass Dark Tower 4.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.880]   I was really disappointed that the stand was not available yet on an audio book because
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.840]   I want to go and read that story.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.840]   You're still reading it.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.840]   That's probably good.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.800]   They haven't finished recording the unedited version that he put out.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.240]   That's probably totally right.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.760]   John you have an audio book request?
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.760]   Okay.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.840]   So check it out.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:01.000]   Two free audiobooks available at audible.com/twit2 and we thank them for their support.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.120]   Alright let's talk about the big news that happened almost immediately after Twit stopped
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.640]   recording last week.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   The AOL buying the Huffington Post probably everybody's heard most of the details on this
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:18.200]   but Ariana Huffington takes control as president and editor in chief of the newly created Huffington
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   Post media group.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.160]   We all love that for the one simple irony.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.000]   Now Michael Errington and Joshua Topolsky report to Ariana Huffington.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   That's great.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   It's like blog all stuff.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   What could happen?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.160]   What could be funnier?
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.640]   I was laughing about that too but then I don't think that's really the way the internal
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.920]   structure of AOL works.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.600]   I don't think they'll actually have to report to her but I'm not entirely sure on that.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.360]   On your knees slaves.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.840]   That was my first impression of Veronica.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.400]   I remember several times at both the tech TV and CNET where they would bring in somebody
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:52.040]   who was kind of maybe a well-known name in the industry and give them the title of editorial
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.400]   director or managing something.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.400]   Yes, editorial director.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.840]   No one actually reported to that.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   Editorial director is a thought-able.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.400]   So when I saw this I thought well yeah they're going to make her head of this group but the
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.880]   blogs aren't actually going to report to her.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.320]   They're going to continue to report the way they are but then people are telling me that's
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   not true.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.280]   No I don't think anything's going to really change.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.080]   I don't think Errington's going to have weekly meetings with Ariana or anything.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   I think it'll be just fine.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.720]   I think this is not like this material.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.880]   If they want to increase their video streams they will have weekly meetings with Michael
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.040]   Errington from TechCrunch and stream them live on the internet.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.920]   Yeah that would probably pack them in.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.720]   AOL obviously going after top name blogs.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:36.080]   A long time ago bought WebLogs Inc and got all the Engadget type blogs.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.680]   They bought TechCrunch recently and now they've got the Huffington Post.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.440]   Is this going to save them?
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.600]   No.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.360]   But I think Leo's got a shot at getting a couple hundred million for selling the Twit network.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.360]   Not the first.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.800]   Jarvis was pushing that on this week in Google this week as well.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.280]   Do you think that's where he really is?
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.640]   He's not in Antarctica at all.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.880]   He's doing a deal.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:00.000]   Yeah that's why his plane couldn't land because he won't have any photos to show because I
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   kept saying come on.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   He goes I want to see photos.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I want to see photos.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   He's already got photos of Buenos Aires.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.560]   He can show those again.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.960]   So now he's no photos of Antarctica because you have to clean your photos of land.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.560]   He's actually in Columbus.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.440]   It's Columbus where they do deals with ALA.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.440]   I don't know what they do.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.440]   He'd be in Arlington.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.440]   Arlington, Virginia.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.440]   He's moved to Arlington, Virginia.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.440]   He's been in Columbus, Ohio.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.440]   No that's a computer.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.440]   One of my thinking.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.440]   Well okay.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.120]   And yeah Arlington, Virginia just outside of the CIA headquarters.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.840]   Yeah AOL is at Reston.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840]   They're at Reston, Virginia.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.040]   Oh okay yeah right outside.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   Reston.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.040]   Reston right.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   I thought they were in Dulles.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   Near Langley.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   Well that's all suburban Washington DC.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   Reston and Arlington DC.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.440]   It's all Washington DC basically.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:50.080]   You know the other thing people are criticizing this move is that Huffington Post has made
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.120]   their name on the backs of unpaid volunteers.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   That's the volunteers.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.360]   Famous ones a lot of them.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   Which people say you know what?
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   This is kind of stuffy isn't it?
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.000]   You don't have to give your stuff to the Huffington Post.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   It's amazing to me.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.320]   They pulled it off and now of course all these guys I mean I don't know about you but I never
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.120]   have not written for them.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.160]   But the if I had been and I was getting no money and they just sold for 300 million bucks
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.480]   you think I'm going to even write another word unless I get some you know how about where's
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   my kickback?
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.240]   Where's my you know 10 grand?
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.880]   I think all the writers that have been writing for Huffington Post should be demanding 10,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.440]   20, 30,000 dollars minimum.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.800]   It was a great platform for a lot of people who wanted to get their opinions and voices
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.000]   heard but you know and obviously not being paid unfortunately.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.040]   But this is kind of a sticky situation for the Huffington Post and I'm very curious to
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.320]   see what kind of conclusion they come to with the writers who have been doing a lot, a lot
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.400]   of writing for them in the past over the past few years.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.400]   It's kind of incredible.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.520]   Are they going to back pay people or are they going to not pay them at all?
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.520]   What do you think?
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.520]   Are they going to pay people going forward?
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.080]   What do you think they're going to do?
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.440]   I know what I think they're going to do.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.680]   They're going to blow them off.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.440]   Yeah well too bad suckers and off they go.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.720]   Well you know it's funny historically AOL has been through this before with their moderators
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.520]   from their chat rooms.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:12.240]   There is a very famous precedent setting case where AOL was hiring and hiring volunteer
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.200]   moderators for their chat rooms and message boards and they got taken to court and the
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:20.400]   court said look if you're advertising for positions and you give them access to your
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.160]   corporate network and you treat them like employees you got to pay them.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.520]   Yeah but this is a little different the way Huffington handled it.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.880]   She didn't do it that way.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.120]   I mean I don't know that there's a wide leap probably.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.560]   Yeah I don't know that they've ever advertised for any writers and I think they just send
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.560]   letters out to people.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.160]   Would you like to write something for us?
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.800]   You know because we'll print it we don't pay but we'll print it.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.680]   I think it's all been up front they haven't been dishonest.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.240]   They haven't been like suckering people in the writing forums so promising something at
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:48.040]   the end and since they did it that way I don't think they're going to give them anything.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.320]   Yeah they just have a big enough audience that people will want to come to them and say
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:56.080]   oh you know I have this big megaphone and to a certain extent a lot of the things a lot
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.680]   of the models that the Huffington Post has kind of championed and it's built up.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.760]   We've been trying to mimic in the mainstream media world.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.160]   We're working on doing aggregation kind of in the same way that they do.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.800]   We're linking to our competitors and doing the same type of things that they do.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.000]   So to a certain extent they've been ground breaking and have changed the media landscape.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.520]   I don't think that I agree with with John I don't think that anything is going to change
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.360]   in terms of their writers unless there's some kind of whole-scale revolt.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.320]   They'll continue to work for free.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.520]   Yeah and frankly if the writers that are currently writing for them don't want to continue writing
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:38.120]   for them and not get paid then I'm sure other people will step up to the bat and want that
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.960]   that conversation as well.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.240]   Yeah and also still not get paid.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.080]   They get paid the exposure John.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.760]   Yeah I got your exposure right here.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.040]   They could return the favor.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.040]   Let's move on.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.160]   Actually no before we move on I want to ask this one question.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.560]   We saw this story from Aleda a couple weeks back claiming that AOL makes 80% of their
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.760]   money off of subscriptions to dial up that people don't need.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.560]   Yeah I think that's probably true.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.320]   So if that's the case that's not going to last.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:14.640]   Well at some point you would think how can AOL continue as a content company if that's
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   true.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:20.080]   Yeah I think what they're doing is very smart here putting together these top name blogs
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:26.200]   but isn't enough can they actually save AOL and turn it into a top tier content company
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.200]   this way.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.480]   I don't know why they can't you know if they have a good advertising sales network
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.640]   why they can't make money doing this the way they're doing it and the way they keep
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.800]   things separately branded you know you get you I think a little more attention.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.040]   A lot of people have always believed they're having a lot of flat sites rather than one
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.680]   consolidated site like the New York Times where you go to different sections as opposed
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.760]   to going to completely different websites like you know the HuffPost it's not going to say
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.320]   it's not you don't go to AOL then jump to the HuffPost you just go to the HuffPost I
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   would think.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.760]   Well Tom I think it's possible.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:02.200]   Tom how do you how do you how would you say now that that AOL is not a top tier content
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.120]   company I mean with with the sites they already have have acquired.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.040]   Well no it's a really good question are they they may be just by virtue of having collected
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.960]   all of these but they're not perceived that way when people think of top tier content
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.800]   companies they they they think of others they don't consider AOL they forget.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.120]   Well who do you think of Web Logs Inc.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:28.560]   Just offhand top tier company I Yahoo IDG and IDG.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:34.520]   But these aren't things you think I mean I mean in the technical space on online content
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.520]   companies.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   What about yahoo?
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.520]   CBS interact Yahoo.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.360]   I don't think of Yahoo as a content company.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   Really?
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:46.120]   No they are they are they are they think desperately want to be but I think they are they I don't
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:51.480]   use them as a content company I never go to Yahoo and read content.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   Well a lot of people seem to go to Yahoo that's a lot of people go to Yahoo I don't know if
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.480]   they're going there well you know they do I do read their movies section for move from
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.400]   some movie they have a lot they they have a couple sports writers that are outstanding
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.680]   consider some of the best in the country they have a lot of content on on and I know I know
