[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   >> It's very successful as you.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   >> That's true.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   >> Truth.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   >> Truth.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I did Cyber Surfer Magazine when I was 23, Print Magazine, 50,000
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Print Run, and I just saw a kind of reporter when I was 24.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> Well, there you go.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   >> So I was a publisher as well.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And people hated me too.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   >> When I was 24, I was pulling a microphone.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> I didn't say people hate me.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> No, no, no.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> Nobody hates you.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   >> When you're that young and you do a publication like that.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   >> There's a little jealousy.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   You have a little jealousy around you.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> I'm jealous.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> People get a little jealous.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> Yeah, I'm jealous.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   >> I never found it.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   >> Let's see.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   >> I think they're like, oh.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You know?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   >> If you weren't such a snappy dresser, I'd be jealous.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> Okay.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   >> But I think, you know, because you're such a good dresser,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I feel like, you know, well, of course, that's why he's successful.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   >> That's why, yeah.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That's why, if I dressed as well as you, I'd probably be good-looking too.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   >> I have a minute hoodie today.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I'm on chill.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   >> I'm not like sitting around in a three-piece suit, you know?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> I don't blame you.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So I think the big story of the week happened yesterday when Google,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I got up at seven in the morning, Pacific time.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   >> Honestly, why did they have to spend that time for us bloggers?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> I was having a lie in.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> Well, no, wait a minute.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   You're in the UK, so it was later in the day.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   >> I know, but I worked crazy hours.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I slept until the afternoon then.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   >> I was actually a twit that stopped me from getting to that story.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I blame you guys.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   >> Why was that?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   >> Well, I was going to, you know, I hadn't listened to the show, so I was like, okay,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I'll get some exercise, hit the dog for a walk, listen to Twits, your pre-Super Bowl episode.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And yeah, and then I got back and that was all over Twitter.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's crazy.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   >> So you got to listen to Twit the day-
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   >> Do you want to get the story out before it kind of interrupts you, though?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   >> Yeah, you got to get, you got to listen to Twit the day it comes out so that you don't-
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   you're not listening to last week's news, Pete.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   That's the problem.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   >> I was just trying to find a way to get away from the fact that I missed the biggest story
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   of the week.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   >> You guys don't call it a lion, you call it a sleeping.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   >> Lion's good, I like lion.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I'm going to have a lion.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It sounds so cultured.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> What is that, a lion's a nap?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   >> Yeah, a lion's a sleep.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   >> Is a sleep.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   >> When you sleep until that time, like three p.m.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   >> I don't have me a lion.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   >> I don't have me a lion.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   >> It is the King's English.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   >> It is the King's English.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   >> I'm not an American.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.400]   >> I got up about seven.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   I wasn't lying in.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.000]   I go on Twitter and somebody's twitted me.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Man, Google's saying that your site, twit.tv, is spyware.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.200]   I went, "Oh boy, that's not good."
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.880]   So I googled it and sure enough, but then I realized, "Wait a minute.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.240]   Everything is spyware."
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.400]   All the way down the list, it says this site may be malware.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.480]   Even google.com was flagged as malware.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.880]   So literally for one hour, you couldn't Google anything.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.480]   And it's like an internet power outage.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   I mean, of course there's other choices.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.880]   >> Wait, you could google it.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.480]   It just would come up with that arrow, right?
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.880]   >> Yeah, and then you have to click through.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.280]   It says, "You shouldn't be going here."
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280]   >> Right, right, right, right.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   You get the roe block.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.480]   >> You don't get the site.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.280]   You get a-- I'll read you what it says.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   It's actually pretty--
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.280]   >> It's a roe block.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.880]   And then roe block, then you have to click through and it's like, "Okay, I absolutely
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.280]   understand that this is dangerous."
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   >> This is warning.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.880]   >> This site may harm your computer suggestions.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.880]   Return to the previous page and pick another result.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   No, that won't work because they're all that way.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.680]   Or try another search.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.480]   Or you can continue to Twitter.tv at your own risk.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.480]   I mean, it's pretty bad.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.680]   So guess what happened?
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.080]   This is the thing that's-- I find mind-boggling.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:33.680]   >> Rissa Meyer posted initially said, "Oh, it's this site we use called StopBadware.org.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.280]   They sent us a list."
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   And it was screwed up.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.480]   And then it's not bad where posted says, "Well, no, man, you don't use our list.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   You make your own list.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   Don't be blaming us, bro."
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.280]   >> I'm not sure if Meyer's post, if you read it necessarily.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.280]   >> Oh, no, no.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.280]   She revised it, Pete.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   You missed it because you were having a lion.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   >> Because I was sleeping.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.080]   Her initial post-- you'll never know this, but her initial post clearly blamed them.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.680]   And they put up a post that, "Wait a minute."
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.000]   And then she updated her post, by the way, in what is considered bad form.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.600]   She didn't mark, "Oh, I've made a change."
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   She just changed it.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.520]   >> So you strike through.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.520]   That was the stat we had at WebLogs, which was, "If we make an area you strike through
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.480]   or put an update on it or something."
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.280]   >> Say, "I screwed it."
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.440]   What is the policy in Mashable?
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.440]   What do you do if you--
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   >> We do update.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.440]   Strike through is problematic.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.680]   I seem to remember we used it early on, and it doesn't necessarily come out in all
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   the feed readers.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.000]   >> It doesn't convert very well, and it looks messy.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   But update, definitely.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Right at the top.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.040]   >> Updates are a good way to do it.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.840]   It says, "Look, we've got an update."
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   Update.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   "I apologize.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.720]   I blamed our partner wrongly.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.600]   In fact, we screwed up," is what she should have said.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   It turns out--
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.360]   >> That said, in her defense, she was very fast to react to an emerging situation on
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.360]   the weekend.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.680]   I mean, she reacted within a few hours.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.920]   >> Well, wait a minute now, Pete.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.560]   >> I think you're Google, and the entire web is down because of you.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.560]   I think she probably got a few phone calls.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.840]   >> Yeah, I think that would be the appropriate response time.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   >> I think--
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   >> Google's down.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   The appropriate response time is immediately.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   >> I think--
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.360]   >> You need to phone us points for that.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.000]   >> Maybe even Larry and Sergey and Eric might have called.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.400]   >> I've got Eric online one.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.720]   I've got Sergey online two, and I've got Larry online three.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.480]   Who do you want to talk to, Marissa?
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.160]   >> Right, it's sort of like ABC goes off the air.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.760]   Somebody at ABC knows.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   This is not like--
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.760]   >> What was it?
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.600]   It was about 40 minutes, wasn't it?
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.840]   >> Well, she says it was 40 minutes, so it's--
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.640]   here's what happens, first of all, because it's really kind of shocking.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.160]   So they have a list, which-- by the way, I didn't even know they were doing this, and
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.480]   I think that Google really needs to make this a opt-out thing.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.760]   You should be a preference.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.840]   But apparently, they create a list with help from stopbadware.org and perhaps others of
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.200]   sites that have malware on them.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.040]   Now admittedly, there's a huge problem on the net.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.080]   There are lots of sites out there that if you go to them with an unpached Windows PC,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.280]   you'll get a Trojan on your system without your knowledge, without you doing anything,
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.720]   just visiting the site.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.560]   So they're trying to be a good internet citizen.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.640]   I have some issues with it, but they make a list.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.960]   And apparently, it's a human-generated list, which is kind of interesting.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.560]   And the human added a line for a site that was just slash.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.760]   Now, in computer ease, slash is a wildcard, it means everything.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.600]   Every site.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.760]   So every site was flagged as malware for-- well, she says 40 minutes.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.680]   It was a rolling outage.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.840]   So it started at 6.30 AM Pacific and went to 7.30 AM Pacific, so it wasn't an hour.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   That's a long time.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.920]   It is a long time when you consider they're doing-- I mean, how many million searches they
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.080]   doing per minute, per second?
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:54.040]   And it's kind of-- and I did kind of comment on that.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.200]   The economic impact-- I haven't seen anyone complaining about lost business, but the
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.640]   economic impact could be fairly major if you've got that kind of volume going on.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.200]   And most sophisticated users know-- in fact, I tweeted, I think Carol Bartz did it.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.400]   Because most sophisticated users know enough to go to Yahoo or somewhere else, and it still
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.840]   works.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.160]   I kind of find this story refreshing.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.560]   I'll tell you why.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:24.080]   It's nice to know that as huge and important as Google is, they can still make a bonehead
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.000]   mistake and just take golding down.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.160]   It's not so redundant and perfect that it can't be--
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160]   What's this plug do?
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   Exactly.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.160]   It's nice.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.240]   It's nice to know in this world of RAID being standard on computers and redundant data
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.800]   centers and synchronizing MySQL servers that somebody can trip on the plug.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   It's still pretty basic.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.600]   I can take out Rackspace or whatever happened.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.560]   You know, like, it's kind of cool.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.880]   And of course Twitter works-- Twitter works marvelously at this.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.280]   I mean, this is how I found out about it.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.080]   This is how the words spread.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.960]   I mean, Twitter was the nerve system of this whole thing.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.480]   Nothing ironic there, right?
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.520]   Twitter's up and Google's down.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.520]   I don't know.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.600]   To me, it's a little scarier than that because it shows how vulnerable this whole thing.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.120]   Well, you would think there'd be a double check in this on what wouldn't you?
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120]   We're tripped.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   Check.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   There is now.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   I'm sure there is.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.120]   So you said--
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   So you said that.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.120]   Send that list to me first.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.000]   Usually, like, when we do stuff at the company hour before, we have a development server
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.040]   area and we push changes to the development server area and then people check it.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.640]   They test, like, you know, the top 20 behaviors and then they push the changes to the live
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.960]   site and then check those same 20 things again.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.080]   Yeah, not this case.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.080]   They didn't check it.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.400]   They should have just pushed it to the development servers and done a search for iPod and seen
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   that.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   I don't know.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.680]   If you're like Google, can you-- I mean, really, realistically, you have a development server?
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.640]   Of course, they must have development environments.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.040]   All they have to do is take the Google index.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.280]   They must have-- they have multiple copies of it in different cities and stuff like that.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.600]   So all they do is take a subset of it.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.640]   It doesn't have to be every single, you know, search result.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.080]   So just, you know, take a little cluster of search results, like even a custom search
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.640]   engine, you know, if it runs off the same algorithm, whatever, just make a little small
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.520]   subset on, you know, 100 servers and push the changes there, test them.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   They must do that all the time for different features.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.880]   I'm sure they'll be doing it now.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.880]   Wow.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.960]   This seems-- you know, this is the unknown, unknown kind of era.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   Right.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.120]   Like, you would never anticipate that somebody would put the slash in there and you would
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.840]   never anticipate that code today would say, OK, for slash, that means every single thing
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   in the index.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.640]   Like, it's just-- it's like one of those little quirky things that nobody could anticipate.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.760]   It's like a double or triple cascading era.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.720]   And-- To me, it's like-- it's not something a science fiction movie, like the-- the-- you
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.080]   know, the Forbund project, Colossus is taking over the world.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.000]   Oh, but there was a slash and the whole thing went, nngh, that was it.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Human survived.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.120]   Yeah, I just-- I'm thankful that they didn't put the slash like in the latest pacemaker,
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.200]   you know, firmware upgrade, you know, like--
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   No kidding.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.960]   12,000 people all of a sudden like, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow,
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow,

[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:14.960]   LaVar Burton actually, and I've connected him with Audible, is interesting. I think this is, well, maybe I shouldn't say it, I don't know if it's a secret, but...
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:24.960]   Oh, he wants to do pro bono readings of public domain stuff, which I really admire him for. I think that's such a great idea.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   It's a reading rainbow.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.960]   Because he's into that, you know, he's into that spreading the word about reading and stuff.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   You know, we stopped on the 25 list at number 10. We're not going to go below that, because Jason's number 10,
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   and Robert Scobel's number 11, so we don't want to go any far.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:48.960]   Robert's sitting there going, you didn't get to 11! Go to 11!
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:54.960]   Hi, I'm Robert Scobel. Who are you? That's the first lot of every video he does.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.960]   I know, I like it.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.960]   Hi, I'm Robert Scobel. Who are you?
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.960]   It's like, okay, he's the guest on your show. You're supposed to know his name.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   Who are you?
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.960]   My name is Steve Jobs.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.960]   What do you do? Robert Scobel.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.960]   I did ask Will Wheaton to be on the show, and he couldn't do it today, but he will be on next week, because he's also on that list.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.960]   Awesome. He's awesome.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:23.960]   Love him. Nate Silver, I'm really admiring Nate. He did 538.com and became an instant star. Instant pundit.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:28.960]   He's a guy who was the baseball statistician. Oh, Malek, of course, deserves to be on that list.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   Oh, back. He'll journal it.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.960]   Yeah, a real journalist. That's the first, by the way, on the list.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:34.960]   Old school.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.960]   Old school. Matt Drudge.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:37.960]   What else?
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:38.960]   Next.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.960]   Never gave me a link.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.960]   Just saying. You know, you could have had your moment. You give me one link to Mahalo.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.960]   I am going to be singing your praises on this week in time.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.960]   I would love Matt Drudge. I would love the Drudge.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   I would love to.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.960]   Owen Thomas.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:52.960]   With Edin.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.960]   Matt.
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   He didn't quite get the beauty shot that you got, Jason.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.960]   It's good.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.960]   Yeah, well, that's because he's not good-looking.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.960]   It's kind of a funny picture.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   It's kind of a sore material right there, man.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.960]   It's kind of a fun picture.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.960]   If you ever met Owen Thomas in person, he's like 800 pounds.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   Shaved head.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.960]   Oh, well, then this is flatter.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   It's a train wreck.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:11.960]   Then that's flatter.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   Dave Weiner, number 19.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   A pal.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.960]   Seth Godin.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   We're having lunch.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.960]   I love Dave.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:18.960]   Everybody hates him.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.960]   Oh, no.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   Every time Dave's on the show, I get more hate mail than I do for you, which is saying something.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   That's an accomplishment.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.960]   You know what, though? I tell you something.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.960]   I'm looking at the chat room today. I'm batting like a thousand people.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.960]   Oh, they love you.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.960]   They're loving the calicanis.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.960]   Seth Godin, number 20.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.960]   Brian Lamb, number 21.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.960]   Ryan Block got pushed off.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   It sounds very, very blog-focused.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.960]   I mean, the question is really what's the celebrity?
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.960]   I think they've missed a bunch of YouTube celebrities who would be found right here.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   100%
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   Where's even like, I mean, how do I say like Tae Zung Day or someone?
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.960]   Huge compared to any of these people.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.960]   Like, would anyone recognize us if we're actually walking down the street?
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   No.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.960]   I mean, come on.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   Where's the YouTube like, yeah, where are the YouTube celebrities in all this?
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.960]   It's an interesting question as well because then it becomes what's the celebrity?
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:18.960]   And I think increasingly in these micro celebrities, it's really who is the most connected person in your network of friends rather than...
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   The whole notion of celebrity is dissolving.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   And when you see, you know, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore on Twitter...
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.960]   You know, Ashton Kutcher is less of...
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.960]   Look at his Twitter follower numbers compared to someone like Jason or you.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:36.960]   You see that he's less of a celebrity within this niche than he is, you know, in the mainstream, but it's just a different flavor of celebrity.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.960]   Different flavor.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.960]   Where's Tila Tila and all this?
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.960]   I mean, she's like...
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.960]   It's her out of Tila Tila.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.960]   Tila Tila has got a gazillion people on Myspace.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.960]   How many friends does she have?
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   But Myspace is so down market.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.960]   We're not paying attention.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:50.960]   This list, it's Forbes.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.960]   So Forbes is not going to go there.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.960]   No, I think they missed the boat entirely to some of these things.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.960]   I think they got on the boat and sailed out the harbor.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.960]   I think they did perfectly.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.960]   Really?
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:01.960]   I think it's a wonderful list.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:02.960]   Just because you're on it.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.960]   I say it's your first time on this boat.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.960]   It's your first time on this boat.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.960]   Pete, you've got many more lists.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:08.960]   You know what your first time.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:09.960]   Don't get too excited.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.960]   I'm going to change your page views.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.960]   You're so mean.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.960]   I'm just joking with them.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.960]   He knows I like them.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.960]   It took four years...
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:18.960]   I've been his stuff.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.960]   I've been his stuff.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.960]   It took two years to run.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   Yeah, you're a good writer.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   I like when you write good stuff about us.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   Counts for something.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   I read Mashable.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.960]   I love Mashable.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.960]   I'm not crazy about it.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.960]   You know when I first met...
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.960]   Oh, well, that's, you know, changeable.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   No, no, it's not a slam on you.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   You redesigned and it got...
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.960]   But it's not my...
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:39.960]   I don't know what it is.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.960]   The blue or something.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.960]   Blue.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:42.960]   What color would you prefer?
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:43.960]   I don't know.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   Red.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.960]   I don't know.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   Leo, it's called RSS.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:47.960]   It doesn't matter.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.960]   Nobody goes to the site.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.960]   You're right.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   I rarely go to the site.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.960]   I read the RSS.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.960]   You're absolutely right.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:53.960]   That's actual.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.960]   Then you just find all the headlines picking interesting.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   I mean, people really don't read blogs in the way they used to when we started anyway.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:05.120]   They skim in Google Reader and then they find what's interesting or they, you know, increasingly
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.920]   they look at the Twitter headlines and then they just, you know, wait for something that
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.760]   appeals to them.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   It's really changing this whole...
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.120]   You can't underestimate how much Twitter has changed what we do.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:19.400]   And I know people complain that we go on and on about it, but it's fundamentally changed
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   the model for bloggers.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.600]   We were just talking about how blogging is kind of condensed into just this kind of
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.680]   semi-professional thing where it's before it's personal.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.640]   It's on so many levels, it's changed.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.640]   It's really...
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.800]   It's really fragmenting in some very interesting ways.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.760]   I was going to say actually, I first met Jason.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.400]   I think we've only met once, Jason.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.840]   No, we've met more of them.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   Have we?
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.640]   I believe so.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.680]   I remember I saw you outside the Palazzo town in San Francisco.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.320]   This is going to be very insightful.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.040]   And I was like, oh my God, it's Jason Calicanis.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.480]   And you were like on your phone or something, you're like, whatever.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.200]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   No.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   Don't remember.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   Whatever.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.640]   It was about 8,000 people who come up to me and say hello.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   Ever.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   I know it's...
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   This is the thing.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.880]   It might have been very meaningful to you, but as a web celebrity on the list, you know...
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.880]   Oh, please, Jason.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.880]   And now look what's happening.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:12.880]   Look what's happening.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   Now look what's happening.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.880]   Now you're above me.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.360]   This proves how meaningless the lists are.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.360]   Hey, it's Christopher Walker.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.360]   I can remember meeting you.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.360]   I remember meeting you.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   The problem was I was meeting Christopher for lunch.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.760]   Calicanis, web 2.0, I couldn't get a ticket.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.880]   I call Patel.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   So Obama...
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.360]   Well, let's see.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:35.640]   How long was it when if you Google miserable failure would take you to...
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.760]   No, we don't have actual news now.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.560]   Yeah, we kind of changed gears.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.560]   Sorry about that.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.320]   You need to alert me when we do that.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.320]   Yeah, I know.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   Whiplash.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   Took four years for Google to address the Google bomb that jerked you to...
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.880]   George Bush's White House.gov when you search for miserable failure.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.800]   Same thing, of course, when White House...
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.320]   Even though Obama's inaugurated, the Google bomb still takes you to the White House.gov.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.320]   Four days later?
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.920]   No, it doesn't anymore.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.560]   It took him four years to fix it for Bush.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.560]   Two, four days.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:09.560]   Is the allegation that Google is somehow more supposed to...
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.560]   For the whole...
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.040]   I think that would be the allegation.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.200]   And not much of a surprise.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.400]   I mean, Eric Schmidt was out there campaigning for him practically.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.400]   I think he was.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.760]   As a matter of fact.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.400]   He was, yeah.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   Um...
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:27.200]   Hey, I don't know if you're following this, but you're not so far off.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:34.360]   Iracom, which is an Irish Internet service provider, has done a deal with the music industry.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.720]   Have you followed that story?
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.800]   I have not followed that story.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.440]   For a while, they held out.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:47.320]   But eventually, they've settled with IFPI, which is the group if P.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.680]   That's the RIAA of Europe, essentially.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.840]   They run 90% of Ireland's music market.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:54:00.000]   It's a voluntary agreement, but basically they're saying, "We'll just cut off anybody.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.800]   We'll disconnect them if they go to BitTorrent, if they download files.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.760]   As soon as the music industry sends us a copyright notice, boom, they're gone."
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:17.280]   I hate to say it, but if you stole something in the real world, you know, you're going
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.880]   to be like, "That's true."
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.640]   You know, it sounds crazy, and it's going to be on a fair because there's going to be
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.680]   a lot of like, you know, they're going to cut off a lot of people who weren't doing
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.680]   something else you go.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   That's the issue.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.480]   There's no real world.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.720]   There's something called, you know, due process.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.800]   But here it's just, "Hey, we assert it," and we know already, at least in the states
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:41.040]   that the recording industry has asserted piracy wrongly many times.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.560]   But if P comes along and says, "This guy's stealing, boom, you're turned off."
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.800]   I have such an easy solution to all this.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:54.040]   When you sign up for your ISP, they should have like a $5 a month option that says unlimited.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.360]   If you have a subscription to one of the five services, you know, or you spend above this
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.960]   amount of money, we're not going to turn your thing off or whatever.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:06.600]   Just like when you buy cassette tapes, a portion of that goes to the website.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.960]   You can't invest it does.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.360]   If you buy dat tapes in the US, it does.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:15.320]   So just come up with something like that where they can say like, "If you've got a subscription
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.200]   to a PC, they don't want to do that."
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.040]   They did it in Canada.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.120]   And as a result, everybody in Canada says it's legal.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.720]   It's legal to pirate.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:29.480]   And so even though the Canadian recording industry, Sarah has said, "No, no, no, no.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.080]   It's not legal to pirate."
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.840]   But they've never been able to pursue a case.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.560]   And finally, a Canadian judge said, "It's the same thing as having a Xerox machine in
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.560]   a library.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.040]   It's legal."
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.800]   And that was that.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.400]   That's why the RIA would never do such a thing.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   I see.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.280]   Well, the damn, I got news for you.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   You're swimming in it.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.280]   You're so...
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:56.960]   It's a little late to put a finger in a dike, so to speak.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.960]   Moving on, quickly.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:58.960]   Fast, fast, quick.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   Get another story.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   I want to speak about this one.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.360]   You sent me over this Wiki answers thing or Wiki.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:09.600]   Yeah, let's talk about this because this is, I'm sure Jason has an opinion on it.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.840]   It's mahalo answers, isn't it?
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.360]   Which is very interesting too.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.720]   So Jimmy Wales has...
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.800]   Actually, apparently this has been around for a while.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:23.200]   It's called technically "Wikia" answers.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.360]   And it's basically a Wiki mahalo.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.360]   It's a Q&A service as Wiki.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.720]   Answers.com has Wiki.answers.com.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.800]   They've had it for a couple of years, like two or three years.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.000]   It's doing really well.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   Is it?
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.920]   The problem is the answers actually turn out to be terrible.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   Which one are we talking about?
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.920]   Well, there's answers.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.560]   Answers.com launched Wiki.answers.com.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.200]   Which they call Wiki answers.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.200]   Right.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.800]   Which is Wiki.answers.com.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:57.600]   Then, Wiki has Wikianswers.com with no dot for the subdomain.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   So...
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:04.200]   And by the way, Wiki claims that they started this before Wiki answers did.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:09.760]   And the end result is all the content winds up being cut and pasted from somewhere else.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:14.400]   And because nobody has ownership of the words and it's all anonymous, you really don't
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.880]   want to take the advice from there.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:21.640]   But they can become huge SEO businesses because what they're doing is...
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   This is what they are.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.480]   They put 1,000 Pokémon questions in day one.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.080]   One of my people looked at it.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.480]   And none of the questions have answers.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.960]   So they're basically going to put in like, "Here's a thousand questions about Pokémon,
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.040]   a thousand questions about Call of Duty."
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.560]   And then get all the SEO traffic.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.280]   Google says, "Oh, this is kind of a little bit of a scam."
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.920]   And then they get pushed down.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.320]   Are you talking about Wiki?
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.040]   Or answers.com I'm doing this.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   I think...
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.600]   I know Wiki is doing that.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   Wiki.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.640]   I think it's because people Google questions so often.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.640]   So...
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.640]   Why is this better than Wiki?
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.240]   And Wikipedia, I mean...
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.040]   Well, Mahalo answers is doing quite well.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:04.640]   What happens is people sometimes want to type in a specific question and get a specific
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.640]   answer.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.800]   So, you know, I want to go to San Diego with my kids.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.040]   What time of year should I go?
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.600]   My kids are age these ages.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.280]   And then you want to get like a more customized answer.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.680]   And people like to do it in a community.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:21.000]   And then what happens is if somebody types in San Diego with kids or San Diego vacation
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.400]   with kids, that page is going to come up.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.440]   I mean, how many times do you stumble upon a Yahoo answer?
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.440]   So people don't notice...
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:29.440]   And this is why Google answers almost lost out.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.640]   They did lose out to Yahoo answers because they were essentially an open system that was
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.240]   free and they thought, "Okay, we're going to get the search."
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.720]   Yahoo answers, by the way, is hilarious.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.920]   Have you seen some of the questions that end up in there?
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.920]   Yeah, I was bad before.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:40.920]   You've got some up here.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.280]   This is a good one.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.880]   I live in Georgia, but I don't see Russia.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:49.360]   No, we're not even here sound, but it says there's tank.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.360]   Should I be worried?
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.720]   This is someone talking about the invasion of Georgia.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.880]   And then someone who corrects them and points out that it's the other Georgia.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.880]   It's not actually...
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.880]   You're Georgia.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:02.320]   Type in, "How is bad be formed?"
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:02.320]   B-A-B-B-B-I-F-1-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:25.840]   Yeah, that's a classic one.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:49.360]   This is from Yahoo answers.
[00:59:49.360 --> 01:00:10.680]   And it's not just a question.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:17.680]   You have a link?
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:43.200]   I'm not sure.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:01:06.720]   I'm not sure.
