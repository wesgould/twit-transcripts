[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.760]   People like the great Harry McCracken.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.840]   He's a technology editor at Fast Company.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.080]   We call him the technologizer.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   Hey, how are you Harry?
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.920]   It's good to be here.

[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.680]   Hello Marie.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.680]   Hello with me.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.800]   It's always nice.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   Always nice.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   Thank you.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.280]   Tech editor for Mashable.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.440]   Michael Nunez is here in the Mashable offices it looks like.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   That's right.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   Yeah, busted.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   I'm here.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440]   You're at work.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   You're in ready to go.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.440]   That's right.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   No, no, no.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   Never a goal moment.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   That's part of the job.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.400]   Made you come to work on a Sunday afternoon or evening.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   Man.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.920]   Although I don't feel as bad for you as I do for the Patrick Bejah.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.920]   Frenchspin.com.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.400]   He's not Patrick on the Twitter.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.960]   He's joining us from just outside Helsinki where it's like middle of the night, but the
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   sun's still out.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.440]   Well, it's artificial light.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   Oh, I've heard of that.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   I've heard of that.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   It's pretty handy.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.840]   It's one in the morning and as when I'm on the show, it's the best reason to stay up
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   so so late.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.240]   Except when the baby's crying.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.240]   That's another good reason.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.240]   How's the baby?
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.240]   How old is the baby?
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.240]   It's one day.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.960]   He's six months, seven months almost.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.360]   So he's at a point where he is trying to crawl, not managing, so getting angry, teething,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.800]   and also discovering object permanence.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.560]   So he's panicking when we're not in the room.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.840]   So one of those lovely times.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.240]   But he's cute, so it's okay.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.400]   That's really, it's fun because until you're a parent, you don't know anything about things
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.920]   like object permanence.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   But then you learn the Piaget stages and the object permanence and it's so much fun.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.080]   He thinks that if you're not there, you don't exist.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   I've been loving the pictures.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.280]   Here's a great picture of Patrick and his six month old.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   Isn't that a...
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   Oh.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.280]   Oh.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   Aw.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   Look at how cute he is.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.440]   It looks like a Gerber baby.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.600]   He's been away for a few days.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.680]   So looking at the picture, I'm going all misty.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.840]   Oh, baby food, label of fodder.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.600]   It really looks like the Gerber baby.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.360]   Like you could use them on baby food.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   That's nice.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's from Patrick's Instagram.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.800]   He's also not a Patrick on Instagram.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.480]   So let's start with the weeks news.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.920]   Elon Musk in the news this week.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.760]   And I don't really want to say anything except just leave Elon alone, folks.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.400]   Poor guy has just been going through hell.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.480]   Elon Musk, according to the New York Times, details excruciating personal toll of Tesla
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.480]   turmoil.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.320]   Nice alliteration, New York Times.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.600]   He says, "This has been the most difficult and painful year of my career.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.800]   It was excruciating."
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.680]   In this, he talks about working 120 hours a week.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   Is that even possible?
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   Just barely.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.720]   That's three normal work weeks.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.960]   So that's three times eight hours a day.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.440]   That really means no sleep at all.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.920]   Well, you can take weekends off.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   Oh, weekends.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   You can take my sleep from Monday to Friday.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.480]   Yeah, okay.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.880]   He also admits to taking a little ambient from time to time to sleep because he can't sleep,
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.680]   maybe explaining the weird tweets.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.400]   He scared, I mean, investors were a little nervous after this interview.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.440]   They were also nervous after his tweet in which he said, "I've got money to buy, take
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.160]   Tesla public, private."
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.480]   And it turned out the funding secured wasn't exactly true, but apparently it was investment
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.000]   by the Saudi government investment fund.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.960]   Isn't there some kind of rule that says he can't make these kinds of announcements over
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   Twitter?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.840]   He's being investigated right now by the Securities and Exchange Commission because the stock price,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.680]   he said, "We're going to buy him back at $420 a share."
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.680]   Sounds like he's a stoner.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.600]   But anyway, and all of a sudden the stock price, which is at what, $4.14 or something, went up.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.240]   And he made lots of money and then didn't do it, and SEC says, "A dude."
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.560]   Can we just say, "Let's just everybody stop tweeting right now.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.920]   This is not ending well for anybody."
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:17.600]   Well, for Elon Musk, certainly, I mean, anybody's buddy, calling people pedophiles over the submarine
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.480]   thing, it was already a problem.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.120]   Now it seems like really, I guess what he should stop doing, maybe stop tweeting.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120]   That's all.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.120]   But also stop working 120 hours weeks.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.960]   That doesn't seem to be going well for him.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.200]   Stop giving interviews.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.200]   Stop taking ambience.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   Stop tweeting.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   There's my prescription.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.560]   Cara Swisher wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.820]   Let me answer the question many are thinking.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.200]   Is Elon crazy?
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.160]   She says, "No, he's a human being."
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   You know what?
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.960]   Elon has said things like, "Look, there are only two companies in America that didn't
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.000]   go bankrupt to auto companies, Ford and Tesla.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.520]   He's making a car that many agree that Tesla Model 3 is the best electric car ever made."
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.640]   Go a long way, Elon, if you just keep under the radar and be crazy like the rest of us
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   in private.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   I wonder why he wouldn't do that.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.440]   Maybe he's just so tired that he can't tell.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.440]   Too tired.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.280]   Well, it's pretty good.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   It's actually a pretty good promotion, too, right?
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.320]   You think it's good promotion or is it bad promotion?
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.560]   Doesn't it make you a nervous?
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   For a while it was entertaining lately.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.720]   I think for a long while it was definitely entertaining.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.480]   As Harry said, I think only recently he seems to ve veered off the rails.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.800]   It just underscores this idea that there's very little upside to tweeting.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:41.280]   Unless you're trying to stir some trouble up and get people mad at you, then I don't
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.400]   really see the purpose of going on to Twitter.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.200]   At this point, Twitter is just this cesspool of hate and trolls.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.400]   I think Elon Musk probably gets a little bit of entertainment out of that.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.160]   But it's also, it's cost him a lot in the past couple of months.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.480]   I think that he's probably finally coming to this realization.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.760]   But certainly it's keeping his name in the news, right?
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.560]   But that's not necessary.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.080]   Maybe if you're Donald Trump, that's a good thing.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:12.040]   But not if you're Elon Musk and you're trying to sell cars and reassure investors.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.640]   Then what's this about?
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.920]   Isalia getting lost in his house?
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.040]   There's just too much weird stuff going on.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   This isn't good.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.640]   We all have weird stuff going on, but we don't publicize it, right?
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.920]   Patrick, I know you know more things going on in your house, but you don't tell the world.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.440]   I don't publicize those.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.720]   It just pictures of cute babies.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   That's all I do.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.680]   But no, I mean, honestly, for the past few years, he has been using social media in a
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.840]   very efficient way.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.080]   I'm talking about Elon Musk now.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:52.000]   It's only in the past month that he's really gone from this Tony Stark Iron Man character
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   to is he taking medicine he shouldn't be taking?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.080]   And I think that's possible to correct.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.280]   He's just been having trouble, I guess, for a month.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.440]   But it doesn't mean that he can't use Twitter and social media in a positive way.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.040]   Until then, it was keeping him in the news in the positive light.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.480]   So I think it's possible.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.680]   He's just been doing a bad job at it.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.800]   Yeah, I mean, I think, but where I draw the line is like this pedophilia stuff.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.560]   There's been a lot of really erratic behavior in the past couple of months.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   And so we shouldn't just gloss over some of his public behavior.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.840]   I think that it really deserves holding this person accountable.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.960]   I think the investors certainly deserve that much.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.600]   And I think that even just like the general public, if you're going to be a billionaire
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:48.000]   and finance all of these really big goals, I think that's great.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.720]   I think that it's awesome that he's trying to privatize space.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.200]   It's awesome that he's trying to develop all these new technologies,
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.040]   including making the electric car more mainstream.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:05.280]   But to call a rescuer pedophile and to do some of it, and also the attacks against the media,
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.720]   I think there's certain behavior that is just, it just crosses the line for me.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.240]   And I start to lose faith in this person as a good leader, as someone that I look up to.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.880]   And I start to just think of him as kind of a madman.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:25.200]   This is someone that's egotistical, narcissistic, and just ultimately thinks that he's always in the right,
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.520]   even when he doesn't deliver on some of his promises.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.800]   Because that's also been the case with a few of his companies at this point.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.920]   I have to say, first of all, Twitter is addictive.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.640]   It's like crack.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.000]   I can understand you just got a tweet.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.560]   You just got a tweet in the middle of the night, whenever you got a tweet.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.600]   It's also, as a media entity, this kind of behavior is addictive.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   Do you think so?
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.720]   It's hard not to cover it.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.600]   I didn't want to cover it.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   I was going to say, "Leave Elon. I'm going to move on."
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   But it's fascinating in weird ways.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.920]   Cara Swisher writes in the New York Times,
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.960]   she says, "People ask me all the time now. Is Elon crazy?
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.680]   No, he's not.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.280]   Not at least in my various encounters with him over nearly two decades,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.360]   including recently in which he has been alternately funny, rude, compelling,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.320]   obnoxious, accessible, easy to deal with, hard to deal with,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.400]   always on outspoken to a faulty, even when he might be at fault, angry, charming,
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.960]   intense, also strikingly confident, deeply human with all the positive and
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.240]   negative characteristics."
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.320]   I don't think that really answers the question.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.240]   He gave a great interview, I thought, with Marquez Brownlee on YouTube.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.400]   But that was all about the Tesla and the factory.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.720]   And it was, "That's stick to that, Elon. You're doing great."
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.080]   And then there's this weird story.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.000]   And I think this is just people hopping on the music and musician,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.680]   Azalea Banks, on Instagram, posting a bunch of weird, increasingly odd posts
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.280]   about him trapped in his house.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.960]   I waited around all weekends.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.280]   She tweeted by these, these have all been deleted.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.760]   While Grimes coddled her boyfriend for being too stupid to know not to go on
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.160]   Twitter while on acid, which is completely impossible.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.040]   That's what's going on.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.360]   I don't know.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.720]   Staying in Elon Musk's house has been like a real-life episode of Get Out.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:18.160]   His humanoid group emerged, crawled out of the Caucasus cave system 15,000 years ago
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.040]   after the first Caucasian homo sapiens did.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.480]   Now I don't know what's going on.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.000]   And then Pork Skin was the last tweet.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.200]   So I don't, it's just...
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.800]   I mean, I think this is veering into, you know, people's magazines.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.080]   It is worse than that.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.880]   Yeah, sensationalism.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.480]   But he has been behaving erratically and it shows on Twitter.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.360]   But I think it's been dealt with in a, not maybe not dealt with, but the reaction,
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.880]   he didn't get a pass.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:56.960]   Everyone has been very concerned by what he has been tweeting and very likely for this latest
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.000]   stock price episode.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.240]   He's going to be in serious, at least there are going to be legal questions.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   So I think it's happening the way it should be.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.400]   And hopefully he will manage to get back to a normal behavior.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.480]   And if he doesn't, we might write him off.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.120]   But for now, things are going the way they should, I think.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   If Twitter did not exist, would people be fascinated by Elon Musk or what like?
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.240]   That's what I mean.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.320]   85% of the things that people find interesting about him just not be apparent to us.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:26.480]   Right.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.640]   And I completely agree.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.520]   It's like a double-edged sword.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.280]   He got benefit from it as you pointed out, Michael.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.880]   But now it's not benefiting him.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:38.320]   Well, and also, I also wanted to say that I don't think Elon Musk deserves that much
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.120]   praise at this point.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.440]   We still don't have our $30,000 electric car.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.840]   We still don't have, I think he goes on to Twitter and he makes these really big promises
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.600]   for all of the companies that he's running.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.920]   But he often falls short of those promises.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.480]   And I just don't see, I think he deserves some credit for trying.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.000]   That's certainly really great.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.720]   That's a commendable behavior from an entrepreneur.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.320]   Okay, so he's trying to reach the moon.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.760]   He's trying to reach Mars.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.560]   He's trying to build an electric car that everyone can afford.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.720]   The reality is he hasn't done any of those things.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.120]   And so I think that we, in addition to the erratic behavior-
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.400]   Hey, those things are hard.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.640]   You don't expect them to be on Mars tomorrow.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.840]   No, I don't.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.920]   But he landed two rocket launchers in tandem.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.640]   And he did some pretty good stuff.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.440]   Yeah, he has.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   He has.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.000]   He has.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.720]   He has to be pretty impressive.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.280]   I think he has to be short of his own, his self-defined goals.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.000]   Go ahead, Patrick.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.160]   Arguably, he's moved the entire auto industry into developing electric cars.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.200]   And at the very least, his cars are reality.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.960]   And what they do would have seemed unimaginable 10 years ago.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.360]   So I think it's a little bit unfair to say he has done nothing.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.760]   Oh, he's as-
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.160]   He's amazing.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.560]   He's delivered on all of his promises.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.280]   No.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.080]   But no.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.320]   He has still- I think the most disappointing thing is that,
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.120]   as I was saying, he was this figure of hope of science triumphant.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:12.880]   And the the volunteerism of man triumphing over the difficult odds of nature.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.000]   Now we're finding out he might be insane,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.840]   which is a little bit disappointing.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.880]   But you know, the book is not written on him yet.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.320]   It's not too late.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.280]   It's not too late.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:23.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.240]   I think Elon could recover if he just gets off Twitter now.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.200]   He doesn't seem insane.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.960]   He just- it's just that it's all out there.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.200]   Right.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.160]   It's all out there.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.760]   And that's one of the things you maybe don't want.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.600]   And I can't understand why he's letting it all out there if he's under control of himself.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.440]   But well, he's under a lot of stress.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.480]   He's working really hard.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.840]   Also, don't forget, Elon thinks this is all a simulation.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.080]   And if you're in a simulation, it doesn't really matter what you do, right?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.040]   Have some fun.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.600]   I think part of the part of Elon's real courage,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.120]   we were- Jason Calicanis was a friend of his, did not want to speak for him,
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.720]   but it was here a couple of weeks ago said,
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.840]   "You know, you understand, Elon was at one point, not only flat broke,
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.680]   but owed hundreds of millions of dollars."
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.720]   After he got up, made all that money at PayPal,
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.560]   started SpaceX, started Tesla, he was deeply underwater and fought back and created something.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:16.080]   And I think that if you have the kind of courage to, to, you know, put it all on black,
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.480]   put it all on red and just let it ride that Elon Musk has,
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.160]   it helps if you think it's all a simulation.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.760]   It gives you some false courage.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.800]   I admire the guy.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.120]   I should say I own a Tesla.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.680]   I bought, I will buy another Tesla when this one,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.800]   the least runs out on this one.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.760]   I think they're great cars.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.880]   And okay, so my initial intent is to leave Elon alone completely shot.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.920]   Not me, no, I refuse to leave Elon alone.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.320]   I think like I'll give him credit for the batteries, but not much beyond that.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.840]   You know what's really interesting? We had Sam, I will submit on last week.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.880]   He's a car guy who works for Navigate Research and is kind of,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:03.920]   it almost feels like he's, he's like anti Tesla, anti-Elon, even in the, he hates the Tesla.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.640]   And I think there, it's weird how Tesla, especially, but, but Elon in general,
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.200]   but Tesla specifically have created this weird polarizing thing where you love it or hate it,
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.520]   right? I don't, it's puzzling to me. It's very, it's unusual.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.600]   And what grounds does he hate it?
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.040]   I don't know. I keep trying to put him on the spot. He said, well, the fenders fall off.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.200]   I mean, I don't know. I, I, you know, but, well, but it's funny, even in my own family,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.360]   my wife hates our Tesla. She hates it. Every time she drives it, she has the thing,
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.800]   try to eat me, try to run into another car. It's stopped in the middle of the freeway.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   And, and I haven't, I love it. I have, and it's the same experience probably for both of us with
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.760]   just different takes on it. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I would say it's,
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:54.640]   it's hard to deny that the Tesla Model S is a, is a really cool car. It's obviously pretty awesome.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.960]   But, but, um, but I just think that a lot of the technology in that's going to be commodified
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.200]   over the next couple of years, you know, Tesla claims, claim to Tesla. Thanks to Tesla. Thanks
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.800]   to Tesla. Oh, and I don't think even, even minds, he's, he's basically given away a lot of his
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:16.400]   technology. He's giving away the self-driving stuff. He's open sourcing it. Um, I think his goal is to
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:25.840]   save the world in a number of ways, solar, but also electric cars. And he wants everybody to
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:31.680]   succeed. And I think that's pretty awesome. But anyway, uh, it's interesting. There's really,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.080]   we do have people have these kind of visceral takes. And maybe that's what it really is,
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.760]   people feel strongly about it. I'm, I'm like cautiously positive about the Tesla. I don't have one.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.120]   So it's not a personal thing. Everybody know who has a Model 3. I wasn't going to get a Model 3.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.560]   I was going to get somebody else's electric car. Everybody I know as a Model 3 says, Oh,
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.480]   you'd be crazy not to get one. So crazy car ever made. And, and it feels like,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:03.200]   sorry, go ahead. It feels like Tesla is a brand that had consumers have kind of a similar
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:10.960]   relationship to as a people who like Apple. Yeah, exactly. Um, so I don't know how much of it is
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:18.640]   actual preference for the objective qualities of the product and how much of it is some kind of
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.200]   irrational attachment to the brand because it makes you feel cool. It is like an apple very
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.920]   much in all of those respects. And if you love something, you're relying to cut out some slack
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.440]   when things are not perfect. Right. I always try to tell people it's okay to love Apple,
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.360]   but don't assume Apple loves you. They're just a company. And I suppose I should say the same thing
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:49.520]   about Tesla. Google is struggling over this search in China project. Project Maven was the
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.320]   military drone project that its employees rebelled against Google says we're not going to do
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:02.240]   artificial intelligence for the army. Now they've got another project to bring search back to China
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:09.120]   after famously leaving China behind. They had an event in all hands meeting this week. Katie
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:19.280]   Conger was live tweeting it and shut the event down. But we, not before we heard that Sergey
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:26.240]   Bryn said I hadn't really heard about this. Sergey Bryn said I had no he's not the CEO.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.280]   Dragonfly, that's the codename for this year's Katie's tweet, became to my attention honestly
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:44.640]   because of all this kerfuffle kerfuffle. And as soon as somebody in the audience noticed this
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:50.640]   casey Newton writing for the Verge said he's somebody in the audience noticed this. He stood
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.240]   up at the microphone and said F you and told everybody there's somebody in the audience who is live
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:04.640]   tweeting this these private remarks and they shut the event down. But what is Google up to?
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:10.640]   That's the question. And remember Sergey Bryn grew up in the Soviet Union is no fan of repressive
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.480]   authoritarian regimes. I thought quite in a quite principled way decided to take Google's business
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:22.080]   out of China after they asked him what I can't remember what it was were they asking to help
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.840]   find dissidents or just sense I think it was just sensor search for such a shut down. Yeah.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.880]   And now they're talking about going back in with censored results.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:38.160]   It seems like someone was looking at China. I mean obviously we don't have specific knowledge
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:46.080]   about any of this but from what we're leaning I would say someone in the company went to their
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:56.000]   management and said listen let's just see how it could work if we could try to make a search engine
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.720]   for China just to see to study it. And they told him all right do it but don't tell Sergey we'll
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.920]   see what happens once it's ready we can discuss it then. That's what it feels like to me. They were
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:17.600]   prototyping it maybe with the intention of discussing it later and see how it would work so
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   that they could discuss it. And maybe someone had in the back of their mind you know what we really
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.160]   need to be in China so that's a good way of trying to approach it cautiously.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.920]   Yeah and then there is we don't know because this is all leaks although leaks that aren't really
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.880]   denied by Google but Google as apparently said well this was just in the early stages but others
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:44.720]   have said it was it's ready to ship. They said some DARPA CHI said it would not be available soon
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.520]   but soon could mean tomorrow soon could mean a year from now.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:56.800]   You know they are remarkably vague with all of this. Let me ask this larger question then.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:02.640]   I'd be really curious what you all think. Well how what responsibility do American companies have
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:10.240]   to stand up for American values overseas. Apple very famously is happy to do business in China.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:16.960]   They say well we're just following the local laws but let's admit the local laws are somewhat
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   authoritarian. Apple for instance has moved all its iCloud data storage for Chinese nationals into
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:33.040]   China with companies that are run by the Chinese military in effect handing over data about Chinese
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   citizenry stored on iCloud to the Chinese government. That seems to me aligned too far.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:46.480]   Because should Google have a search engine that sensors uncomfortable information the Chinese
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.720]   government doesn't want its people to see or should they just step out of China.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.560]   Is there so much money there that American companies can't turn their back on it?
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:01.920]   When do they have a moral responsibility to say you know what no amount of money can get us to do
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:07.600]   business with China. It's a really complicated question. I think you can make legitimate arguments
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.560]   in either direction. I did admire Google for pulling out just because it is unusual for any
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:18.960]   company to do something that is ultimately a hit to their bottom line. If they come back I think
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:24.560]   you can also make a case that an imperfect Google is better than no Google at all. It sounds like
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:29.040]   they are talking about having disclaimers on the search engine. They would make it apparent to people
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.920]   that information is being withheld which is certainly better than silent, silent link,
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:41.360]   erasing stuff. I remember being in China during the initial week or revolt the week is now being
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:47.680]   apparently incarcerated by the millions in China. They're a Muslim minority in China.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:56.800]   During the original revolt I was in China 2009 watching CNN and CNN started reporting about the
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:03.440]   Uyghurs. It just went black. It went black for three minutes and then it resumed. So it's not
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.120]   like the Chinese authorities want to hide the fact that they're censoring. So I don't know if
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.600]   saying this is censored is doing anything. That's better than nothing. I guess it's all you can hope
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.000]   to do. But that big chunk of black was a pretty clear signal. There's something going on
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.720]   that our government doesn't want us to see on CNN. And the Great Firewall, although it's
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:32.480]   been a while, I think I was last in China in 2009 as well. And at that point the Great Firewall
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.400]   was pretty imperfect. And it let some stuff through and it's hid some stuff. But my understanding is
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.440]   it's gotten a lot more effective more recently. That's another example of China going along
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.320]   with the Apple going along with the Chinese regime. They blocked VPN apps. They pulled them out of
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.080]   the app store in China so that you can't try to get around the Great Firewall.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:58.080]   I think one of the considerations for tech companies, it might have been different. When
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.880]   did Google pull out was in 2009, 2012? It was earlier than that.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:13.200]   Yeah, they looked at it and they might have thought, well, they didn't really think
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:23.120]   how long they were going to have to not be in China. 10 years later, this might go on forever.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.800]   Are they forever going to abandon the Chinese market and abandon? I'm thinking about money,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:36.960]   obviously. They might be missing out on 100 years worth of Chinese business because it doesn't seem
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:46.880]   like China is losing its grip on its population and intending to loosen the censorship.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:55.680]   And you can make arguments on those sides, as Harry said. And there's also the argument
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:04.960]   that you should not decide for another population what is good for them, which is a very complicated
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:12.560]   argument in itself. But is it for Google to decide, well, we don't like China, so we're not going to
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:20.800]   serve them? It's the kind of thing I think where you commend them for taking a stand, but also
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   understand them if they don't. I don't know if that makes sense.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:30.320]   I guess it also depends on what Google's actions or Apple's actions or any company's actions
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:38.400]   mean. One thing maybe to censor another thing to help arrest dissidents. Yahoo got in a lot of
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.080]   trouble because Yahoo! mail was used by the Chinese government to arrest dissidents.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:47.520]   And I thought that was really reprehensible of Yahoo! to hand that information over.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:55.200]   I don't see how Google can be in China in any way and not somehow get into that system as well.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.440]   It seems impossible for them to not, they have so much data. At some point, the Chinese government
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.400]   is going to go to them and ask for whatever data you don't search or anything else. So if they do,
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.440]   they're going to get into that discussion as well.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.600]   Not just China, my point out that the world is rapidly becoming more authoritarian. There's
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:24.560]   also Turkey under Erdogan. There's Egypt. There's lots of countries. And at some point, you undermine
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.960]   your economic footing if you say, "Well, we're not going to do business where it's authoritarian."
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:36.320]   Yeah, I just don't see this self-imposed ban lasting. I think of this
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.360]   man, the player said, because it was against their own business interests. But I just think
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.880]   that ultimately if your goal is to vacuum up as much information as possible, you're going to
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.520]   want to get to the most populated country in the world. And so clearly, there's a gigantic business
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.960]   incentive there. They have a new CEO. A lot of time has passed since the umbrella revolution and
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:01.600]   the last kerfuffle between Google and the Chinese government. And I just expect the company to
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:08.320]   find its way into China. Even if it never has a majority market share of searches, or even if
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.360]   it's a very small percentage of searches in that country, I think that they'll find a way to do it.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:20.960]   And I don't think that they really owe anything to the human rights advocates as much as I
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:28.000]   tend to align with those beliefs. I don't think that Google itself owes anything to anyone.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.680]   There are a lot of American companies that do business in China, that do business in a lot of
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.680]   sketchy places around the world. And that's just kind of... I just think that's the collateral damage
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.560]   of globalization. This is just how the world works. We don't talk about Exxon
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:51.120]   mobile doing business abroad, or some of the other Fortune 500 companies that have strong
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:56.720]   footholds in other places around the world. We just happen to be harping on Google and Apple,
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:01.600]   because there's sort of a Silicon Valley backlash at this moment in time.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:08.240]   If this weren't a tech show, I'd be going after the pharmaceutical companies. The Exxon's
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.840]   the world as well. But we're talking about tech companies on this show. I think it's time for
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:19.200]   American companies to stand up and say, "These are the values we believe in, and we are not going to
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.520]   put profit ahead of those values." No, but the value is going to leave in this capitalism.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.720]   Well, if that's all you believe in, if all you believe in is profit, okay. That's by the way,
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:34.320]   the statement that they are making. All we care about is profit. I agree to an extent, but also,
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:42.720]   I would think it makes me a little bit uncomfortable to say, even though in an ideal world, I would
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.880]   love for Apple and Google and all of the tech giants to say, "No, sorry, we're not going to
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.400]   hand over information on dissidents, so we're just not going to do business in China." That being said,
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:31:00.960]   telling that it's the job of companies to take these kinds of moral stands seems a little bit
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:09.200]   weird because in my mind, and maybe that's because I'm a dirty European socialist,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:16.640]   it's the government's job to say which country, if you put a ban on trade with a certain country
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:24.240]   because the government representing the people estimates, "This is too far. We don't want to
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.640]   encourage that behavior. You're not supposed to do business with them." That's one thing, and that
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:39.600]   process exists. It doesn't seem like it's complicated. If the US does an issue, sanctions on a country,
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.800]   then we should be free to operate in any way we want. Well, Exxon never said that that mission
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:52.080]   statement was, "Don't be evil." Good point. Google may be abandoning that, but... Google brings us on.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:58.000]   Google, in some degree, Silicon Valley in general, opens itself for more criticism here because they've
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.520]   always positioned themselves as being good for the world and enlightened.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.960]   So here's what China wants. Good article, probably worth reading for anybody listening
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.760]   after the show from Foreign Affairs, Adam Siegel, writing, "When China rules the
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.720]   web, he's talking about the fact that their current president, President Xi, is very much
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:22.640]   aware of the importance of the internet to Chinese economic future and very much wants to influence
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:29.040]   it." She's words, "Cyber sovereignty represents the right of individual countries to independently
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:35.120]   choose their own path of cyber development, model of cyber regulation and internet public policies,
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.240]   but that's fine. Yeah, I guess every country could do that, but this is the one that worries me.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.520]   Participate in international cyberspace governance,
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:50.960]   international cyberspace governance on an equal footing. China envisions a world of national
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.760]   internets with government control, justified by the sovereign rights of states, but it also wants to
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.880]   weaken the bottom up private sector led model of internet governments that here in the United
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.000]   States, we've championed for many years. Beijing sees that as dominated by Western technology
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.080]   companies and civil society organizations. They want more say in what goes on, not just in the
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:19.440]   internet and China, but globally. That bothers me. That worries me." I think they would say that,
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:27.040]   but it's our narrative to say, "Well, sorry, that's not how it works."
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:34.000]   Wait, why does that bother you though? It's not too active to actively shape cyberspace at
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.920]   home and on the global stage. I think that worries me. I think the idea of cyber sovereignty
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.000]   already exists. They're not-- I understand. I have no problem with that. They can do what they
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.880]   want within the borders of China, but if they want to influence global cyber policy,
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:56.960]   that bothers me. That worries me. No, I think that's definitely a couple of bridges too far.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:03.680]   But then the problem is the camel's nose under the tent, right? You give them an inch to take a mile.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:10.240]   I sound like an old guy. And furthermore, a stitch in time saves nine.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:17.280]   Hey, we're having fun. I'm glad you hear Michael Nunez from Mashable. How are things at the new
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:24.720]   Mashable? They're going well. So we have new owners in the same office. But yeah, everything's
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.040]   going pretty well. I, of course, know Pete well, and I have a soft-- we'll always have a soft
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.840]   spark in my heart for Mashable, all the friends who've gone through there. I want you guys to do
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:39.280]   well. So I'm glad to hear it's okay. Good to have you on, Michael. The technologist, Harry McCracken,
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   has been around for a long time. A long time. A long time. He's technology as a very fast company.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:51.200]   And always a welcome guest. I wonder when Harry's first Twitter appearance was. It's been a long time.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:59.040]   It was, I think it was, I believe it was just as I was segueing out of PC world.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:06.160]   That's right. We're starting your own. 2007, maybe. Yeah. I remember at the time, every time I got
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:13.520]   a new Twitter follower, I had to get an email. And I was on Twitch. And my email inbox broke up.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.160]   That was when you could still get an email for every new follower.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:25.920]   So then that must have been around 2007. I'd say. We just crossed 14 years into the 14th
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.840]   year for us, Kireen now. And I think we're in a well in our 14th year for a Twitch.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.600]   So actually, that's not right. Is it Carson? Because I think Twits, when did we start in April?
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:44.640]   Yeah. So April 2005. So we're in our 13th year soon to be in our 14th year. Also with us,
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.040]   Patrick Bejau, who's also a longtime friend of the show. Always great to have Patrick on French
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.320]   spin.com. He does English language and French language shows.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.200]   Out of, absolutely. Head world headquarters in Helsinki. You figure it out.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:06.160]   You know, who else has been with us an awfully long time audible. I think audible probably started
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.760]   advertising right at the very beginning. I know I started using audible in 2000.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:17.200]   So I've been an audible subscriber longer than I've been doing. Twit. That's because back in the
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:26.000]   old days, I had a commute from hell all the way down to San Francisco. And I probably, if it weren't
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.800]   for audible, I would have probably gotten in a crash or road rage or something. Audible has saved
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:42.640]   me so many times. Audiobooks from audible are pure enjoyment. I want you to take a look. Audible
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.760]   audiobooks are a great sidekick for whatever you're doing. Anytime you can't hold a book,
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:54.960]   whether you're hiking, sunbathing on the beach, cooking, walking the dog, and of course commuting.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:02.480]   They have an unmatched selection. I've lost count. Unbelievable selection of audiobooks,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:11.280]   but also original audio shows, news, comedy, audible broadcasters, entertainers, magazines.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.280]   You can now, the audible app, if you haven't seen the audible app in a while, you really
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.520]   ought to check it out. The audible app has gotten so interesting because you can do clips, you can
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:25.520]   send clips or books to friends. They let you listen faster or slower. I know a lot of people
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.400]   listen to podcasts faster. You can speed it up if you want it, or if you slow it down if you want.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.120]   And because audible is owned by Amazon, when you buy a book on audible, you can also buy the
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.720]   Kindle version. And then with whisper sync, you can read it on the Kindle and then pick up where
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.160]   you left off on audible and vice versa. I love whisper sync. Audible members get credit for every
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.880]   month. Good for any audio book, regardless of price. Don't worry, unused credits, roll over to
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.320]   the next month. If you don't like a book, no problem. Exchange it, no questions asked.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.880]   Your books are yours to keep. In fact, that's one of the things I love the best when I go to my
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:06.560]   audible library. Oops, it wants me to log in. I love it because I have a long time audible member.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.480]   I have hundreds of books in my library. I can listen to it anytime. It's like a real library.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:18.800]   That was one of the problems I had with the I used to listen to books on tape. Remember those days?
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.320]   You'd have to mail it back after a month. I never would even finish a book in a month.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.840]   So what are you listening to these days on audible? Let me give you some audible recommendations.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:33.760]   Anybody else? This is what I'm taking. We're going on a vacation to Europe. I decided to do a
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.960]   little Heinlein binge. I read Heinlein in high school. I haven't read it since then. Moon is a harsh
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:46.160]   mistress and stranger in a strange lander coming with me. Oh, this new Stephen King, the outsider.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.000]   Lisa and I. So one of the things Lisa and I do is we will pick a book that we both want to listen
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.280]   to and we'll listen together. And she loves the Stephen King. I do too. So we're listening to
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.240]   a recommendation. Yeah, Patrick Bejal. What are you listening to?
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:04.720]   So I listened when my wife, Sonia was expecting, I listened to bringing up Bebe.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:14.560]   Bringing up Bebe. It's an American woman who went to Paris with her two or three year old
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:23.520]   and reflects on American and French ways of educating and raising babies. It is it's a really
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:29.680]   interesting for the education part, but also it's super funny. Very well written. I had a blast
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.720]   listening to it. If you're expecting or have a small child, I highly recommend it. It's very
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.600]   enjoyable. Actually, that's another good reason I have audible as your child ages
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:51.280]   becomes a reader. Even if he or is it what's his name? Oh, my yeah, my child. Oh, he's a little boy
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:58.720]   called in this. Oh, in this. In this, yes. In this from yeah, like a nice and in and the east.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:06.800]   And yes, it's from the Iliad. Oh, in this. Oh, in this. Good name. Sorry. I don't know the English
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.400]   premise. Yeah, and he is. How did a Nias die in the end? I think he was carried off on a shield.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.680]   I might be wrong. But anyway, let's not talk about that. He escaped. He escaped and ended up
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:24.160]   being found in Rome. Yeah, not himself. But that was Romulus and Remus, the two wolf kids. Yes.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   Yeah, he's the the ancestor of those. I should read more on books I'd know all about in the
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.920]   US. There's a new version of the Iliad actually read interesting as well. Oh, I've read it. I'm reading
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:41.200]   it. I love it. It's a new translation. That's phenomenal. Oh, you know what? This is the other
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:48.080]   thing I always do. I always look on audible to see if the book I'm looking for is on here. Let's
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:55.520]   look for the Iliad. I have it. I know it's available on audible. Is this the Anthony healed
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.880]   translation? Is that the new one? I've read Robert Fitzgerald, which is a classic. I think this is
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:07.120]   the new one. Anyway, there is a new translation that actually notes by a poet. It's by a female poet.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:14.800]   Carolyn Alexander Alexander. That's it. She's a poet. Do go to audible. Get a free audio book
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:21.120]   with a 30 day free trial at audible.com/twit or you could text "twit". This is a new way to do it.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:27.200]   Text TWIT to 500 500. That's the short code and they'll send you a link.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:37.360]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E audible.com/twit or text "twit" to 500 500. I am bringing about 30 books with me on my
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:42.960]   trip. I know I won't finish them all, but what I like is having them on my iPhone, especially on
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:50.320]   the long plane flight. It's like 15, 20 hours and I can listen to a great book. So many good books
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:42:00.880]   at audible. I'm really enjoying it. A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/twit. B-B-B-E. I should listen. The Aniad is also
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:10.880]   about Aniis, right? Yeah. It's his travel from Troy to basically what ends up being Rome.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:17.280]   But it's not so. I mean, he Dito falls in love with him and then he doesn't want her
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:23.360]   and he commits suicide. It's a little grim. Yeah, it's a little grim.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.920]   But yes, it's about him as well.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:35.280]   There it is. No, that's not it. I want to find the... Wow, there's a lot of versions of the
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:41.520]   Iliad on Audible. You could hear a lot of different... Some of them 54 minutes long,
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:49.520]   some of them 16 hours long. You get to choose. I just got it, but I got it in book form,
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.640]   the new translation. I'm really admiring it. She really did a nice job.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:59.120]   All right, let's get back to the tech news. Enough about audiobooks, although gosh knows,
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:05.920]   we could spend the long time talking about them. What else happened this week? Apple is saying
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:12.960]   it's buildings and it's headquarters are only worth $200. Some of them, not the whole thing.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:21.600]   The company is appealing the Santa Clara County tax collector saying that a cluster of properties
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:28.880]   around Apple Park is just worth $200. Again, if you're a corporation in America,
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:36.320]   you can do anything as long as you're serving profit. Apple also had a... Let's see, I don't know.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:42.080]   Do I want to talk about the iPhone rumors? Should we talk about is it appropriate? We're getting
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:48.480]   awfully close. Yeah, a few weeks now. I'm guessing, I'm going to guess September 12th.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.400]   That seems to be the current wisdom. Consensus. Consensus.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.000]   So they don't want to have it the day after Labor Day, because Apple doesn't like its employees
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.600]   after work through the holiday weekend. So it's not going to be the September 4th, Labor Day is the
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:08.160]   third. It's not going to be 9/11 probably, right? Because that would be sacrilegious. So what about
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:14.080]   the next day? Wednesday, September 12th. Yeah? Anybody got an invitation?
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.840]   Makes sense. We won't... Nothing we can talk about, right? Yeah, no, you get the invitation.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.760]   You get to publish that, I think. I don't think they make that. Yeah, I think usually that's true.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.880]   NDA. And it would be still a little while before those go out?
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.920]   Usually a week or two ahead of time, right? I think they send them out a little earlier than
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.600]   they once did, but it's not all that much time. People probably complain because you had to book
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:40.960]   last-minute tickets to get to New York. Will you go? Harry? If invited, absolutely. Yeah.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:45.840]   You never want to assume anything, though? No. And they have them now at the Steve Jobs
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:51.280]   Theatre on the Apple campus. I think the last one a year ago was the first big event they had at
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:56.560]   the theatre, yeah? That's an advantage, right? Because they don't have to telegraph their intent.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.440]   They probably even could move it at the last minute if they felt like they were ready. Yeah, they don't
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:08.720]   have to rent a space where it might leak. The rumor right now is pretty strong from a variety of
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:18.640]   sources that there will be three new iPhones, one LCD, two OLED. The sizes will range. The LCD
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:26.320]   version about six inches, they'll be a smaller OLED 5.85, same size as the iPhone X, and a giant
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:34.880]   six and a half inch iPhone. What is it? 10s? 10 plus? 10 plus? Maybe 10 plus. That sounds good,
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:43.360]   doesn't it? iPhone 10 plus? Oh, will it be 11 plus? It goes to 11. 10 s. So the rumor is 10s and 10s
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:53.200]   plus. Oh, okay. Yeah. Tennis. Tennis. I mean, yeah. And there's also the latest I read, I don't
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:46:01.120]   know how reputable the source is, is pencil compatibility. That is bizarre. Is it not? Well,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:07.680]   I mean, the Samsung Galaxy Note definitely has a follow in, but it has a little pen that goes in
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:12.880]   the note. This would be a pencil that's bigger than the phone. Maybe they'll do them any pencil.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.400]   Oh, they could do one with a slot. I mean, they're not where the headphone jack used to be. I don't
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.560]   think they're going to do that, but they might conceivably sell a smaller one as an accessory.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.680]   Yeah, they would have to because it doesn't make sense to use that giant pencil with it.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:30.880]   But even then it has so many implications in the OS. I think we would have seen that
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:38.880]   somewhere show up some leak or something because you can't have a pen and not have a way to write
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.760]   full sentences on your phone. That's a good point. Or at least, you know, one word at a time.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:50.800]   And there's no trace of it in iOS 12. Exactly. Yes. Of now. iOS 12, the public beta is at
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.480]   beta six. The developer beta is also beta six, but it's called beta seven for developers.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:02.080]   And it's pretty stable. I've been using it. I just did the latest update yesterday.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:07.200]   Yeah, it just came out. There are some quirks still, but it's not, you know, and we got another
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:13.840]   few weeks. What will the selling price be, do you think? Are they going to raise their eyes?
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:21.680]   I think the 10s is going to be 9.99 and the 10s plus is going to be, you know, 12, 11,
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:28.240]   99. Yeah. You agree, Michael? Yeah. I feel like they have no reason to, I feel like they have to
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:34.560]   test the limit of this pricing scheme. You know, the iPhone 10 has done really well for the company.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.000]   The revenue numbers have done particularly well at a really high price. And I think they'll
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.920]   push that boundary just a little bit. That's my expectation. I'm able to get half a terabyte.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.880]   If you feel like it, maybe. So yeah, the note nine is the note nine, a bellwether for all this,
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:55.520]   because Samsung's new note comes out of a thousand bucks for 128 gigs of storage and the four,
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:02.320]   six gigs of RAM. Is it four gigs, six gigs of RAM. And then the next step up is $1,250 for
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:11.200]   512 gigs storage. That's an awful lot of money. But yeah, I guess. I think the difference for
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:19.040]   Apple is they're going to keep the iPhone eight in the store and push it probably, you know,
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:24.400]   offer it for maybe give it a little bit more visibility than in the past, because that's a
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:32.960]   more reasonable price device to answer the the concerns of, ah, you're going even further than a
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:38.960]   thousand bucks. But the the taboo has been broken already. So and there's also the LCD version,
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.800]   right? That'll be the low cost. Yeah, cheaper. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:52.560]   iPad was an iPad at the event. Hope so. I mean, it's more than do that we got iPad Pro
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.880]   upgrades. It's been quite a while since anything significant happened. Yeah.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:07.200]   It's the face ID iPad, right? Yeah, that would be interesting. I have to say I mixed feelings
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:12.400]   about face ID fingerprint works so well. I'm concerned about a notch on an iPad. Not
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:16.400]   where is the notch go? Does it go on the left? Do you have to hold it in portrait mode to
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:23.360]   log in? Unlike, I mean, a smartphone definitely has a primary orientation that's portrait. I feel
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.840]   like iPads, depending on what you're using them for, your primary orientation could be portrait
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.080]   or landscape. It's mostly you're on an iPad right now. Mostly landscape like you have it, right?
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.640]   For a lot of people, I think, but but if you're using it more for reading stuff and don't have a
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   keyboard, it can be a portrait device. Yeah. Notches are just a scourge on the other hand.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.240]   On the other hand, they could do face ID, but not squeeze the screen quite as much. Yeah.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:56.720]   I think there were icons. Yes, there were somewhere in iOS, right? For a notched iPad.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:03.200]   Yeah. A big small bezel notch. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're going to do it. They're just forging
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:11.840]   ahead. And just as strange as the notches, people will get used to it. And even it, you know, it's very
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:22.000]   surprising how much of a fashion sense influence Apple has. The notch. See, the notch everywhere.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:28.240]   It's weird, but yeah, you see it everywhere. It's kind of even though it is not great aesthetically
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.760]   and for the screen, having a film without a notch and that's probably going to grow very fast.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:41.440]   But having a film without a notch feels like it's the old thing, right? Like, ah, yours is the
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:48.400]   one without the thing that's new and that Apple has popularized. So I think they're just going to
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:53.600]   do it whether we like it or not, which is not uncommon for Apple. They move the time over on my
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:59.680]   iPad already in the betas so that they cleared space for a notch. That's right. Yeah.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:03.680]   Oh, no, it's over on the left hand side. I saw that too. There's nothing in the middle. There's
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.640]   completely room for the notch. They move the time over Google apparently with its pixel threes will
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.920]   also have notches. You can't have more than three notches though.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:22.560]   According to this story, Google bans Android funds from having three or more notches. Good. I
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:28.080]   think that's good. The notch wars. I think we should hold on for no more than two notches.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.200]   I want to set a notch phone.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:38.720]   I thought for a while a notch was kind of an interim technology that maybe that was just because
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.720]   they couldn't figure out how to do the cameras through the screen. That maybe someday we would
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.320]   have a phone with a fingerprint reader back again through the screen. I mean, there are
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.200]   cameras through the screens, but maybe not. Maybe we're just going to live with the notch.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:56.400]   I would say don't get to like the notch too much. Hold out for a notchless phone.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:01.520]   Yeah, I'm still waiting for fingerprint scanners through the glass. Yeah, the
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:07.200]   world happened to that and also unbreakable. I haven't just sapphire glass. That was that.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.160]   People have thought that years ago. It's got all those plants to make sapphire and they end up
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.320]   using sapphire on the watch, I think. Someone has fingerprint scanning under the glass and
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:22.160]   spacing out on who? Samsung, I think. They don't have it yet, but they have a patent.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:25.120]   Is there one plus? Does somebody actually know it? Somebody actually works.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:34.000]   I think a parts manufacturer is already doing it. I'm not sure there's a phone that maybe it's
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.680]   a quote. There's one or two. Confused.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:41.520]   The first, here it is from Android Authority. The first under glass fingerprint sensor is here.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:47.520]   It's from Vivo. Vivo. No wonder we don't have them.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:55.120]   This is a Chinese phone manufacturer. According to this article in Android Authority,
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:59.600]   it's noticeably slower, taking 0.7 seconds to unlock.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:06.240]   Maybe that's what happened is Apple said, yeah, we can do it, but it's not a good experience.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.080]   Remember, Apple, because they have such control, they could
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.200]   decide, oh, we'll release that later. We'll release it in October. They can do anything they want.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.520]   So who knows? We're only guessing. We should say that.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:27.600]   I'm hoping that Face ID 2.0 is as much better over 1.0 as Touch ID.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.280]   What's wrong with Face ID? What does it need?
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.880]   It's not. It doesn't work perfectly 100% of the time.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.560]   Sideways is a problem. That would be an issue if you had a notch on the side.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:42.160]   The original version of Touch ID was fairly good, but not perfect.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:46.720]   And Vision 2.0 got to a place where it basically worked super quick every time.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.040]   So I'm hoping that Face ID, they have the same opportunity.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:56.000]   Apple is reassuring customers after Australian report that teenager,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:04.240]   16-year-old from Melbourne broke into Apple's system from his home many times over a year,
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:13.440]   downloaded 90 gigabytes of secure files. He apparently even said he got the secure stores where
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:21.840]   keys were stored. The sensitive documents, the police rated Apple content to the FBI,
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:27.280]   which then referred the matter to the Australian federal police. The AFP rated the boys home.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.880]   They took two laptops, a mobile phone and a hard drive that matched the intrusion reported by
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:38.000]   Apple. It wasn't too hard to find the data. It was stored in a folder called Hacky Hack Hack.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:45.360]   Hacky Hack Hack. And as often happens when you get caught doing this stuff,
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.520]   he couldn't resist boasting to friends on WhatsApp about what he had done.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:54.720]   An Apple spokesman said the company's information security personnel "discovered the unauthorised
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:00.080]   access contained it and reported contained it after he downloaded 90 gigabytes." That's not
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:06.720]   exactly instant. And reported the incident to law enforcement. We want to assure our customers
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:16.560]   at no point during this incident was their personal data compromised. So what was in that
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:24.720]   Hacky Hack Hack folder? We may never know. We probably don't want to know.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:30.000]   Maybe we don't want to know. I feel like it's probably best that I don't know.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.080]   Actually, surprise that Apple didn't offer this kid an internship.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.240]   Come on. I think the kid was disappointed that he didn't get offered an internship.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:42.000]   Yeah, I feel like you got to throw him a boat. That's a pretty cool...
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.240]   I thought this was the best way to get a job.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:49.680]   Yeah, it's a nice resume builder right there. I don't know. I'm kind of disappointed that they
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.800]   didn't offer him a little more.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:58.640]   Hacky Hack Hack. I mean, if you boasted to his friends on Snapchat that he did this,
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:06.480]   how likely is it that he didn't dump any file at all anywhere on the internet?
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.680]   Yeah, no good question.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:14.080]   He obviously knows what he's doing. I mean, his folder was named Hacky Hack Hack.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:24.400]   But seriously, he probably frequents hacking forums and had to get informed on how to do this
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:32.480]   somewhere. How do you break into Apple, download 90 gigs of data, and refrain yourself from
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:40.560]   posting at least some of it somewhere. I guess maybe he didn't, but it's surprising.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:44.000]   Oh, that was encrypted. Was it just sitting on his hard drive encrypted?
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:51.280]   Maybe. I mean, Apple may know that in fact it wasn't exfiltrated for his ways to find that.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:56.800]   I guess watching the guy's internet connection. It was at home after all. He's 16, so we don't
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:02.000]   know his name, which is fine with me. I don't want to know. I would like to know his hacker name,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.080]   though. Hacky Hack Hack.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:10.960]   One more Apple story. Apple's in trouble in Japan right now. They're a Japanese Fair Trade
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:20.000]   Commission is investigating allegations that Apple forced Yahoo Japan to kill a game platform that
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.440]   had that didn't require the App Store bypassed the App Store. The Game Plus platform was launched
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:32.240]   July of last year. You could play games without needing to download apps.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:41.520]   I didn't play any of these games. I don't think it's Yahoo Japan, which is different and more
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:46.000]   important than Yahoo US. That's right. It's not the same company. It's still a big deal in Japan.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:54.400]   It was within the Yahoo app that you could download games. That's what line does already.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:58:00.080]   I said it was webcast. What the difference is there? Are they always web based?
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:05.840]   Maybe. They have even less of a leg to stand on if it's web based.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:10.400]   The Fair Trade Commission and the industry ministry began to receive. This is from the
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:14.000]   Nikkei Asian Review. It began receiving reports from Yahoo last fall about issues
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:20.560]   surrounding its Game Plus platform. It let users play games without needing to download apps.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:27.760]   That's all it says here. Yahoo abruptly slashed its budget for Game Plus last fall and now has
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:35.440]   all but stopped promoting the service. Yahoo told multiple business partners who
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:41.040]   was forced to cut back because of pressure behind the scenes from Apple. The company relies on
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:46.000]   the US Tech giant for part of its profits in the form of sales through the App Store.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.400]   Interesting. We'll keep an eye on that story.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:58.240]   All right. Let's take a break and then we're going to talk about Google following you around
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:02.480]   whether you like it or not. They actually as a result, we talked about that last week or was
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:08.560]   that on Twig? It was Twig. As a result, Google has changed its location tracking policy and language
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:15.760]   and a lot more coming up in just a bit. Our show today brought to you by Uber.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:22.000]   Often in more ways than one, often our hosts are brought to you by Uber as well. I certainly
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.840]   ride Uber around. When Abby got in her last car accident, nobody was hurt. She wasn't hurt.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.400]   The car was totaled. I said, "Abby, it's cheaper for you to ride Uber."
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:38.640]   And so I set up Uber on her phone. I said, "I'll pay for this. It's a lot cheaper than me.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:42.480]   She's still in college paying for a car, paying for insurance, paying for gas."
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:49.120]   And I love it. She loves it. Uber is moving forward and they're doing it with a bunch of
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:56.160]   features for riders. She really likes the fact that she can see who her driver is. You can actually
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.920]   put notes in the app saying, "I'm wearing a red shirt or a baseball hat." You can even choose a
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.400]   color in the app to light up your phone's screen and hold it up as more and more people use Uber's.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:11.840]   Especially in a big city on a crowded corner. I've had this problem. It's me. It's me. That's my
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:18.080]   Uber. You can now hold up a red phone so that the driver could spot you at night or in a crowd.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.800]   Just a few of the new features Uber has added to the app. They want to improve the ride sharing
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:30.240]   experience for riders and drivers. And they want you to come back. I've been using Uber for a long
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.520]   time. I haven't stopped and I still use it all the time. Uber.com/moving forward. If you want to see
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:42.880]   what Uber is doing to make rides easier, to make it easier to get a ride, to learn more about your
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.960]   driver ahead of time. I think a lot of credit to Dara, their new CEO, who has really transformed
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.320]   the company. I am a fan and I think you should be too. To find out all the ways Uber is moving
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:05.120]   forward to see the improvements they've made to the app, go to uber.ubr.com/movingforwarduber.com/moving
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:10.320]   forward. Uber is headed in a new direction. And we thank them for their support of this week in
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.760]   tech. Before we get to the Google thing, does anybody use MoviePass?
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:27.520]   No, thankfully no. What is going on? So, the latest, so MoviePass stock went to basically nothing,
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.160]   because the company admitted, well, it really isn't a sustainable
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:40.800]   model. The idea was you pay a flat monthly or weekly rate and you get to as many movies as you
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:48.000]   want. But that's considerably changed. They've changed their model. They've changed their usage.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:57.440]   It has not been a good week for MoviePass. On Wednesday, they were supposed to put a new plan
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:03.440]   into effect to introduce long-term stability. Actually, that was last week into the Movie
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:10.480]   Subscription Service. Instead of $9.99, $9.95 a month getting subscribers up to one ticket a day,
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:16.240]   you now get three movies a month. That's a big difference. A month.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.320]   A month. I thought it was a week. I think it's a month.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:29.280]   It didn't help much. The company's lost 90% fewer movies a month.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:38.000]   $126 million the first half of the year lost, spending $73 million a month.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.200]   Stock went down to what it was like a quarter. I don't know what it is right now. A number of
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:50.080]   people jumped in saying, "Here's a chance to make some money." They were, unfortunately, not.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:56.800]   Here's thousands of investors got creamed. How did they let it reach that point?
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:11.520]   They weren't able to pay their bills. Basically, $78 million. What is it? Did you say a month?
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.960]   It seems like you would see it coming when you don't have money in the bank anymore. A few months
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.400]   in advance. The inflection point was when they knocked it down to $10 a month. Originally, it was
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:28.160]   like $35 to $50 a month in appeal to a rather small number of people. At $10 a month, that's less
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.920]   than one movie ticket in San Francisco. All of a sudden, they had huge numbers of customers and
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:40.960]   every one of them lost the money. Was that it? They were too successful? I think so. That's how
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.520]   their failures scaled up at least. That's how you lose a lot of money. You only lose a little money
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:52.160]   if you have a few customers. Their latest plan, it's three movies a month, but you have to pick
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:58.160]   from the movies on a special list. Just not comprehend something. A daily shortlist of movies
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.320]   that will be available to subscribers in any given day. Many of the movies you don't want to see.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.080]   I think I'm looking at the list. A lot of them, maybe all of them.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:13.760]   So we have a similar system in France. We have a similar system in France, but it's per company
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.520]   or per chain. You pay $20 a month and you can go see any movie you want
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:25.520]   anytime you want during the day. They're copying movie paths. The change of a new
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:31.280]   that is here. It's per company. You have a similar thing in the US as well. The problem
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:38.080]   movie pass has is that it's any movie anywhere, any theater you want. That's what makes it
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:43.680]   impractical. Here are the movies you can see tonight on movie paths. Crazy Rich Asians.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:50.960]   That's supposed to be pretty good. A rom-com. Black Klansman, the mis-education of camera and
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:58.640]   post. We the animals. Skate Kitchen, which looks like people skating on a banana.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:07.840]   Juliet, Naked, and Summer of '84. None of them have I, except for Crazy Rich Asians have I heard of.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:13.360]   That's what I know. I never understood movie paths. I think the people who had movie paths
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:18.400]   in the first year are very happy. It seems like there's not much left.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:24.880]   Black Klansman is Spike Lee. I'd go see that then. That sounds good.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.520]   You're the movie guy. You should know what all these things are.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:36.480]   They had surge pricing for a while. They were going to raise the price to $15, but then they
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:43.120]   backed down. What's fascinating to me is that in Silicon Valley and Tech, there are
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:51.280]   so many examples of these loss leaders. Businesses that cost more to operate and to run on a daily
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:58.880]   basis than they cost more than they're able to actually make. Amazon was famously an example of
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:05.280]   this. There are probably dozens of other that we could rattle off. In this case, people just aren't
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.760]   cool with it. The investors don't want to really participate. It sounds like this company's floundering.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:17.680]   It seems like the idea of subscription-based movies is just not something that's going to last.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.960]   Ultimately, it seems like the trend that I see happening is that people are going to be...
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.200]   Eventually, this is going to go directly to consumer, directly to your set-top box at home.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:34.560]   That movie theater is getting harder to convince people to spend money on going to the movies.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.480]   They can watch a lot of these things from the comfort of their own home
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:46.320]   and do so at any time they want. I just feel like it's just been interesting to watch movie past
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:55.200]   sort of try to find its way through this dark room. Because in theory, it sounds great. You pay
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.560]   a one-time fee, you can go see many movies a month. It's probably a lot like a gym membership.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:07.840]   Most people won't go to see a lot of movies. That was the model, obviously. That seemed like.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:17.040]   But what I'm learning is that my math was somehow wrong about this. In fact,
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.960]   they're actually losing a ton of money. It's starting to sound like this is unsustainable.
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:28.640]   And maybe this model just isn't right for movie fans for the entertainment industry.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:34.160]   They underestimated how many movies... It's like one of those all-you-can-eat restaurants.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.360]   They just underestimated how much people could eat. I think there's something weird with the
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:45.200]   financials there. Because in France, the system has been in place for I think 15, 20 years now.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:52.000]   Really? Yeah, but it's just one chain not at a time. There are two major chains
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.360]   that each have their own movie past, essentially, and they're independent. So you can't go to the
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:04.160]   other chain's theater. Yes, so movie past worked anywhere. And they actually had to pay the theater
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:09.680]   the full ticket price. Almost all cases. So if the theater's doing it, they don't have to pay
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.480]   anybody. They're giving you a deal. Originally, moving house to division, movie theaters would
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:19.920]   love them and cut them a deal. We finished it. We did not love them. A few small chains do cut,
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:25.520]   maybe past a deal. But the big ones don't want them inserting themselves. A.C. hated them. Yes.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.240]   And then released its own plan. The big ones can do this not bad.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:36.000]   Yeah, they can do it themselves. But France is equivalent of $15 a month, Patrick.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:43.680]   20 euros. So a little bit more. It's probably 25. But the thing is, if you have that, then
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:50.560]   you kind of go to the movies, quote unquote, for free. So you're more likely to go to the movies.
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:57.200]   One thing should be added though, in France and in Paris, especially, it's much easier to go to
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:02.720]   the movies. You walk out the door and you probably have a theater, you know, five, 10 minutes away
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:09.280]   by foot. Paris is basically the city with the highest number of movie theaters per capita in the
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:16.480]   world. We really love our movies. So that might play into it as well. But the fact that you have
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:24.320]   a subscription to it makes you go more because it's easier. So it's a way of sustaining maybe the
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.880]   industry. And there are a whole lot of other things that happen in the movie industry in France. But
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:36.160]   an industry where people are getting disinterested in going to the theater, that's a way of keeping
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:42.400]   them going to theaters, I think. This is actually a French invention. The movie,
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:49.200]   you've had this for 15 years. Movie pass also this vision that the data they were collecting about
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.160]   movies people like to go to would be very valuable. And if you went to a lot of Marvel movies,
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:00.480]   someone would be willing to get that data to sell you Marvel DVDs or T-shirts, whatever. And as
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:05.040]   far as I know, that hasn't has yet to pan out. There was, for a while, they were talking about
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.200]   investing in their own movies. They were talking about selling marketing information to movie
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.720]   companies doing special promotions that would help box office sales. Like even out the demand
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.840]   for movies. Yeah. But none of that happened. Almost none of it. It's interesting. I did not
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:26.880]   realize it started in France though. Yeah, it wasn't easy at first because the other one change
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:35.520]   started it and the other one had a huge lawsuit claiming it was illegal and they lost it. So of
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:43.200]   course they did as well when they lost in order to compete. Now, Michael, have you looked at any
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:49.680]   of the competition like Cinemia? Cinemia? No, I have not. I've never heard that one.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.640]   Yeah. This one actually came out of Europe four years ago.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:59.760]   For 99 a month, you can get one ticket a month. 699 two tickets, 10 dollars, two tickets per month.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:05.760]   But that includes something movie pass never included which is 3D 40 and iMax movies. 15 bucks a month,
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.080]   three tickets a month. So it's a little more expensive than movie pass.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.440]   But yeah, I just, I don't see how this can work in the long run because like what I've kind of
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.800]   noticed is that movie theaters are getting much more. They're focusing on like being a luxury
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:27.360]   experience. They're getting big recliners and now you can eat dinner at a lot of theaters.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:33.840]   And a few of them you can drink alcoholic beverages. There's one in my hometown that has a Starbucks
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:40.320]   in the theater. And so it's becoming, the tickets are way more expensive. They're like 20 to 30 bucks
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.680]   a ticket. And it's almost like a restaurant experience. I'm watching this awesome movie. I'm
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.960]   watching Mission Impossible, Wellie, Chicken Wings, and Drink Beer. And that's awesome. But
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:12:00.960]   it's less. I'm paying the price to do that. I'm paying like 30 bucks. And so it doesn't make
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.560]   sense to me how a company could charge only 10 dollars and expect you to go to unlimited movies
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.360]   or let's say even three movies a month. The math just like doesn't make sense to me unless they're
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.160]   able to, I guess recoup that through some of the data stuff. You know that that was actually
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.560]   something I didn't know. But I guess it makes it makes complete sense that they would try to
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:27.840]   gather more information about their customers and then sell that to different data analysts.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:34.560]   But without that extra component of the business, I just don't see how they can sustain themselves
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.720]   over the long haul. It's pretty clear. The only people that can really sensibly do this are big
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.800]   movie chains. Because then they don't have to pay themselves. AMC's solution, which is called
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:52.240]   Stubbs A-List is $20 a month. But you have to go to an AMC theater, which is fine if you live near an
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:59.920]   AMC theater. I don't know. Is that unlimited? I guess it is. The "Son of Mark" one basically boils
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.840]   down to movies for nine bucks and a discount on popcorn. That's not bad every time we go to the
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:12.320]   movies we save a few bucks. Yeah. Movie Club. You buy a movie ticket a month for a discount of
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:20.080]   $8.99 and you get 20% off popcorn or other concessions. I always thought that the way that,
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.720]   I don't know about this. Maybe you guys do, that the way it worked was that the ticket sales went to
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.360]   the movie company and the concession sales went to the theater. Is that correct still or is that?
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.640]   New movies on the first week, most of the money goes to the theater, to the movie company.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.320]   That's why big weekend, big opening weekend is a big deal. And the longer the movie runs,
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.840]   the more that the theater gets to keep. That makes sense. I think if it's going to work,
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.400]   it's going to be cinema. It's going to be AMC. It's going to be the theaters doing it as it is in
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:55.520]   France. That makes a lot of sense. So here's a six. Go ahead. Sorry, Michael.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.360]   Well, I was just going to ask, do you think that this is just kind of prolonging the death of the
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:06.160]   movie theater? I like to think that at some point, at least, one of the big movie production
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.000]   companies has to try releasing something directly to the internet.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.320]   Remember, Sony had a box you could buy, very expensive, that you'd get first run movies.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:22.160]   And they would satellite them to you or somehow get them into that box. But it was only Sony first
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:26.960]   run movies. Right. Well, they did try it with the interview, which I know there was a kind of a
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.120]   special circumstance around that particular film because there was the big hack. But again,
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.720]   Sony did try, at least, to make this movie available to everyone at home.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.240]   I just feel like that's the way that people want to watch movies now.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:46.720]   I mean, look at the Academy Awards, for example, or any of these entertainment award shows.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:53.120]   More streamers like Netflix are winning awards for their feature films. And I think that if
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.160]   that's the case, there's going to slowly be less of a difference between going to the theater
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.760]   and seeing Mission Impossible 3 versus staying at home and watching,
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:10.560]   you know, I don't know, another action movie on Netflix. And I just feel like that's the way
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:17.520]   things are heading. I think there will always be movie theaters. And the reason is very simple.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.720]   It's because the movie companies can sell you the movie multiple times.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.960]   If you go to the movies and then buy it on Blu-ray and then watch it on Netflix,
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:34.240]   they've sold it to you three times instead of once or twice. Of course, it's different if they sell
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.640]   it to you for 30 or 40 bucks at home when it comes out in the theater. But I think the
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.480]   different experiences, people do want different experiences. And maybe there are going to be less
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.640]   movie theaters, but I don't think they're ever going to go away. And it's still going to remain
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:56.160]   a big part of the business for a long time. It's just, as long as it makes money.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:03.600]   And what we've seen for all the talk of, we just want to stay at home and we want to binge Netflix,
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:09.920]   you know, in the past few years, we've seen the biggest blogbusters we've ever seen,
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.920]   box offices. So...
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.400]   Is that because they're charging more for tickets? Or is that because more people are
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:21.920]   going to see these movies? I think a lot of people are still going. I don't know, but I mean,
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:25.520]   you know, Marvel is doing okay. And they're not the only ones.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.000]   It's those movies that are doing the best though, right? I mean, the big movies, the event movies,
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.320]   the movies you want to see in a theater with a lot of friends, where the movies have great special
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:42.400]   effects or sound. So Sean Parker, there's a name you might remember, had a company called
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:48.880]   Screening Room. A couple of years ago, they announced it. The movie companies were fighting it.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:56.000]   Last year, I saw a story that is still coming and he had partners, including Steven Spielberg,
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:06.800]   Ron Howard, big filmmakers, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, J.J. Abrams, Peter Jackson.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:12.000]   Nothing happened. Now this is an article from, honestly, the best way to watch newly released
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.720]   movies in your house. I don't know how you would get this. It's still coming soon. You pay $50
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.680]   for a 48-hour rental, but it's the same day and date that the movie comes to the theaters.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.480]   And of course, you have to buy the setup, which is $150 itself. Would you do that?
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:33.600]   $50 a movie to be able to not go to the theater? Yeah, some people would.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.920]   If you had people with this 100-inch screen we've got here in the studio, maybe,
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:43.040]   and a giant surround sound system. I like going to the movies, but I don't go every week for sure.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:48.720]   I don't know. What are young people doing? Do they still go to movies? I like being around
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:56.080]   other people. We do, but a lot of my friends, so I'm 30 now. And a lot of my friends have
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:02.880]   recently started having kids. That's what screws it for. Yeah, there is a big change in priorities
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:08.240]   as there should be when that starts to happen for people. So I think when you're young and
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:14.640]   either single or with someone and you don't have the constraint of being a parent,
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:22.800]   then absolutely. Movie night is a great date. But when you add the element of kids, I think it becomes
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:29.360]   way, way harder to justify going to a lot of movies. And then often, what I've kind of put
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.400]   is that the types of movies that they actually go out to are no longer summer blockbusters.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:41.600]   These big franchises, like Infinity Wars, Avengers, or I don't know what
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:48.240]   it's like. We thought television would kill movies back in the 60s and 70s. It didn't.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:53.680]   But the internet has done a pretty good bit of damage to the movie industry.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.160]   I guess I don't think so. I don't think so. It hasn't. People, well, as we were saying,
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.360]   the box office is very successful still. Maybe it's not exactly all the same movies that are
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:11.360]   making a lot of money. And also the in-house day and date of release, 50 bucks
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.720]   movie ticket or movie streaming, whatever it ends up being.
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:25.200]   As you were saying, it's not selling the movie to people who would go see it in the theaters.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:29.920]   It's selling it to the parents with young kids who can't go to the theater,
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.320]   selling it to people who wouldn't be going otherwise. Mostly, there's going to be some
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:44.000]   intersection there. Here's an interesting graph. It really depends who you talk to about how
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.240]   movies are doing. The blue line is the number of tickets sold. That is dropping. The red line
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.480]   is the revenue. That is going up because tickets are much more expensive. In fact,
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:20:00.240]   it's gone up and more than made up for the loss in ticket sales. But if I'm in the movie industry,
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:06.000]   I might be starting to worry, well, I guess ticket sales are about the same as they were in '95.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:12.080]   But if you compare 2002, where ticket sales were 1.5 billion tickets sold compared to
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:18.160]   the bottom last year, 1.2 billion, that is a drop. So I don't know. I don't know. I guess it
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:24.400]   depends who you ask. It is a drop, but maybe in the same way that the music industry
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:33.680]   has seen its volume drop. If you look at the volume, the revenue of the music industry,
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:39.760]   it's dropped. I can't remember exactly, but it's like to what it was 20 years ago or something like
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:48.320]   that. Get this. The average ticket price in 1995, Batman Forever, came out $4.35.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:54.960]   I always wonder which people are paying these prices? Yeah, I don't know. They say the average
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:59.600]   price this year is $9. It's a lot more than that in the Petaloma. I think it's more like $12.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:05.360]   And movie budgets are also a lot higher. So I don't think you could make the movies you're making
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:12.560]   now with $4. But that's what's driving continued ticket sales is the blockbusters.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:20.080]   I would guess the Star Wars, the Marvels, things like that. I don't know how we got into movies.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.280]   I like talking about movies. A movie past, that's right. Yeah.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:32.720]   Well, I feel like it's also a key part of technology. A lot of us have reviewed tech for a long time.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:38.960]   And I feel like the foundation for tech reviewing was building a home entertainment system. A lot
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.320]   of people. It's true. It's in the old days. It's in the old days. Yeah.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.080]   Yeah. Well, I'm like, yeah, this is what I think this is what most Americans want.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.760]   They imagine a gigantic flat screen. They imagine having surround sound to augment that experience.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:57.360]   And then you start to add little boxes to it. It could be a fire TV, it could be an Apple TV,
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.760]   it could be an Xbox One, PlayStation 4. But all of these things inevitably
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:08.400]   create what used to be called a man cave, which is not, I feel like that's not really a term that's
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:14.640]   thrown around much because it's a sexist term. But this was part of the American dream, at least
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:20.400]   in my opinion. No, that's an interesting point of view. It was all about getting that man cave
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:26.560]   going. Yeah. You wanted a house and a white picket fence and within the house, you wanted your
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:33.760]   command center if you want to call it that. Let's see. This was the success story of the week.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:40.640]   On, let's see, August 13th, what is that? Four days ago, five days ago, the AP unveiled a study
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:45.200]   that they had commissioned from researchers at Princeton that showed even after you turned
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:52.560]   location history off on an Android device, Google was still tracking you. An app like Google Maps
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:59.360]   would every time you open it, not only save your location, but send it off to the Google servers.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:06.400]   After the study came out, Google responded by clarifying its policy. And I think that's really
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.440]   what was wrong here was not so much that Google was doing that. I mean, when you open a maps app,
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.080]   of course, Google is going to have to say, well, where are you? And then send that back to the
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:21.360]   server so you can download that data. It just needed to be more clear to users that that was
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.640]   what's going on. If you want to use a map, even with location tracking turned off, we need to know
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:32.960]   where you are. Now Google has modified its help page for the location history setting, saying,
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.880]   quote, this setting location history does not affect other location services on your device.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:44.960]   Some location data may be saved as part of your activity on other services like search and maps.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:51.840]   Tempest in a teapot or did the AP catch Google with its hand in the cookie jar, your thoughts?
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.800]   The wording was definitely confusing. I think location history, if I understand correctly,
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.920]   is basically if you personally want to keep a log of where you've been because it can be
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:06.960]   interesting, that's what that's for in the same way that the web search history is something you
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:13.280]   can go back to. But they certainly did not make that clear. And I could totally understand why
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:21.760]   people would think it was more sweeping. If you turned off location, your maps wouldn't work,
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:30.240]   but Google wouldn't know where you are. So, well, it's semantics. It's location history,
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:37.680]   right? The name of the setting. It's not location or GPS. It's location history.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:47.840]   The expectation from this would be you don't store my location history in the way that Harry was
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:56.800]   defining it. And there was some semantics that were not great there, but location,
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:01.600]   I guess my point is location history is not just location. It's location history.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.960]   It doesn't mean you're disabling location period.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:09.600]   Right. Yeah, it's in Google's interest to be as clear as possible about all this. In fact,
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.520]   the AP pointed out, I've forgotten about this. Remember Google buzz?
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.320]   Google had gotten a lot of trouble. Early social network attempt by Google leaked people's
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:27.680]   email and other information. Google was fined and actually made a 20-year agreement with the FTC.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.760]   This is back in 2011 in which they said the consent decree said Google will not
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.320]   misrepresent the consumers how they could protect their privacy. They actually have a legal burden
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.920]   to show consumers what they can do to protect their privacy. So that seems,
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:52.480]   I think Google not only has an obligation to do it just morally, but now they also have a legal
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:58.080]   obligation. Be clear. That's all. Just tell us what you're doing. FTC is not saying whether
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.480]   they're investigating Google over this. Go ahead. Well, these tech companies have gotten really good
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:08.160]   at this type of language. It's always like one or two words. Yeah, exactly. I think
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:15.200]   it's been referred to as something called dark patterns in user interfaces or just in language.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:20.640]   So I'm noticing this a little bit more, especially following the GDPR,
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.840]   because although a lot of these companies are compliant with this new data privacy law that's
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:33.680]   been established by the EU, a lot of them are still using what I would consider misleading
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:39.200]   language. I think that just through the way that they design these user interfaces,
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:47.680]   they lead customers to believe that sharing information at all times is the best. Ultimately,
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.080]   that's going to lead to the best experience, which I think is partially true. But there are a lot
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:59.760]   of things that are either omitted or just not described plainly by Facebook, by Google,
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:08.240]   by Twitter, by a lot of these data mining companies that I think the more attention deserves to be,
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:14.320]   or sorry, I mean, we should be having more discussions like this about the way that the
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:20.080]   language is built on a lot of these sites because sure, maybe this was a mistake.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:26.080]   But also you have some of the smartest minds in the world. You have a team of thousands and
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:31.200]   thousands of engineers working on this. How could you not possibly get this right? I think that
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:40.000]   we're giving companies like Google, in this case, a lot of leeway and a lot of room to fail. I mean,
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:49.360]   I think maybe this isn't the most egregious thing that they've done all year, and there are other
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:55.520]   big issues that the company is dealing with. But it does bug me that something is plain as location
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:00.800]   history. In my opinion, that's pretty obvious. You should not be logging customers locations
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:07.920]   if they opt out of that through the location history setting. What Google said was that there
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:14.480]   that multiple settings exist throughout their various products. And so the language was a
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.680]   little bit off and it sort of misdescribed what was happening in a different program rather than
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:26.480]   Google Maps. These companies have become really good at obfuscating the truth, which is that
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.400]   they're trying to follow you every second of the day, your location, your interests, your
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:35.040]   general disposition. They're trying to profile you in as many ways as possible so that they can
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:39.680]   help advertisers target you. Do you think they're afraid of telling the truth that it'll scare
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:47.200]   people and then they won't use the services? 100% yes, I do. They're just not telling the truth
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:53.920]   because they don't want to scare us. Yeah, I think if people understood how powerful
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:59.920]   these engines were, these artificial intelligence engines were, then they'd be frightened. I think
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:06.960]   that people would be disturbed by how much information is available through various data
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:12.640]   brokers. It's not just tech companies. Obviously, there are databases of credit card information,
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:18.240]   and hedge fund managers can go buy that information, or maybe it's a magazine. You subscribe to
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:22.960]   Wired and to GQ. They know that you're a male that's into fashion and tech. There's ways of
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:28.240]   getting those bits of information. The issue is that companies like Facebook and Google
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.600]   specialize in gathering all of that information from all of those various data brokers,
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:38.960]   and then packaging it and reselling it to new advertisers. And I think if people understood how
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:47.680]   powerful these machines are, how dramatic the effects can be on your disposition, on your
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:54.640]   feelings day to day, just based on what you see, I think people would be disturbed, to say the least.
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:59.680]   I think they're a great year. It's a grim view.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:09.040]   I think they are. We've been talking about this for a couple of years now. The tech companies
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:17.120]   are not the darlings that they were a few years ago. You mentioned GDPR. I have to say, even myself,
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:25.120]   I don't know if you get as many of those notices for GDPR in the US that we do in Europe. I'm
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:32.880]   guessing less. But I use private browsing on Safari, on my iPhone and iPad, and I have, well,
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:39.200]   Chrome on my PC. So obviously, I completely tracked on everything on the PC.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:47.200]   But on the private browsing, I have gotten to the point after what two months now of GDPR being
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:53.920]   in effect, where I don't even look at the banners anymore. It's constant. The banners have to be
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:02.400]   a third of the size of the webpage, at least, on the phone. It usually takes half of it.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.920]   I don't look at them anymore. I just click OK, accept, accept, accept, accept.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:11.680]   I don't really know what the solution is, because I think arguably, this is the most
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:18.480]   compelling and complete solution you can offer. Yes, there are dark patterns, but
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:23.360]   I don't even want to look at them, because it's on every site, every time I visit. I just click
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:31.440]   accept. I'm just realizing what's happening now after just a couple of months.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:35.600]   I don't think that's working either. So I don't know what the solution is.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.880]   No, it's the fact of the opposite, isn't it? You become in your...
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.240]   Yeah, now I've given consent. We get the Chrome and the cookie announcements now.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:49.360]   It's really annoying. Every webpage. I use cookies. Of course you use cookies. Is that okay? Yes.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:55.040]   And at this point, you just accept, accept, accept. It has not accomplished anything.
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:59.120]   Right? I don't think so.
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:04.240]   I mean, it has built the framework to build upon.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:08.240]   Yeah, and I think you're right, because the companies now are being much more careful about
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.840]   what they do. Yeah, and like any law, I think that laws are rarely perfect when they first roll
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:18.800]   out. They're often refined over time. So that's a good start, in my opinion.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.520]   I think at the very least, they have to be forthcoming and offer you possibilities.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:30.800]   I think the one part that is a little bit that becomes annoying is the fact that you have to
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:39.360]   accept everything all the time. But the fact that they have been put on notice and that they have to
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:46.880]   let you change some of the settings or... It doesn't need to be a giant banner all the time.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.560]   Maybe a better approach would have been you have to have some kind of
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:33:00.720]   API to let your browser extension decide what type of tracking you're okay with.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:04.480]   And that propagates without you having to click and select and do all of that.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:10.000]   And I don't think it would have been much more complicated than what the webmasters had.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.800]   You know, the web developers had to do already for GDPR.
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:19.280]   So maybe there's an iteration on this that can be... Here's my conspiracy theory, paranoid.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:25.360]   Does GDPR say you have to put up the cookie announcement? You have to get the consent this
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:30.560]   way or is it it does? Because I'm thinking the companies are doing this on purpose. They're making
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:36.720]   it as kind of repetitive as possible so that you just get used to it and say, "Okay, fine."
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.880]   And I know they're using cookies already. What I care about is what they're using those cookies
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:44.800]   before. Yeah. Which that message never really explains. So I feel like maybe companies are...
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:50.240]   I remember when I was a kid, I think I've told this story before, I went to a power plant. We had
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:54.560]   a tour of power plant. And everywhere in the power plant they had signs to conserve, you know,
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:34:00.000]   be green. This was in the 60s. Be green conserves. And my teacher said, "They just put those up
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.280]   everywhere. They don't really have any intent. They just want to lure you to the whole idea so that
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.480]   you just go, "Yeah, yeah, you're conserving." And forget about it. It's one way people... It is an
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.800]   interesting technique. You just say it over and over again until it becomes nothing.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:19.680]   Meaningless. Maybe that's what... Yeah, I feel like these companies are using just these huge
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:28.000]   walls of text to intimidate people. It's like terms of service. When's the last time you read a
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.240]   terms of service agreement before you actually agreed to it? Oh, nobody really says that.
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:38.000]   Yeah. No one reads those. And that's what these GDPR notifications are turning into.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.560]   It's another wall of text that we're asked to scroll through for legal purposes. But no one
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:50.000]   is taking the time to read this. And the companies have very little incentive to actually explain
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.440]   this information to people. In my opinion, what I think that there should be more of is more
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:00.880]   insight into the back end. We should have at least some exposure to what's going on on the back.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.880]   That's what we're going to do with it. That's what Harry said.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.280]   Yeah, if you're collecting all that information about all these individuals, including myself,
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:10.800]   I'd like to see what that profile looks like and how it's being used to it.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.720]   That gets us back to where we were because that's what we're saying to Google. Just be clear.
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:19.120]   Just tell us what you're doing. It's okay. And then I think we concluded they're not doing that
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:23.920]   because they know that we'll go, "Oh God, we know what they're doing. We don't know what they do."
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:29.840]   You and I know, Patrick. We know the panelists. The listeners know. But the average Joe doesn't
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:35.440]   have any idea. Really? I think most people understand the general idea of it. They collect
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:42.320]   your information and then use it to target you for ads. We've had enough examples now that
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:50.080]   we know exactly how that can work. Just like you don't ask every person in the world to have an
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.360]   intimate understanding of the medical procedures that are happening in a hospital every day,
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:01.200]   you can't ask every person on the planet to have an intimate understanding of how the profile
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:10.000]   is built on an ad tech company to sell you ads. With the GDPR, I've looked into the options of a
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.920]   few of them. Some of them are very complicated and you can feel that they make you go through
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:21.920]   three levels of accepting and of details to confuse you. Some of them are quite simple.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:27.040]   Some of them, you really understand, these are the cookies that we need in order for the site
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:32.720]   to function. These are the ones we use for ad tracking. You have a few categories.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:39.040]   Some of them are pretty clear. But even those, I would bet you no one bothers to go look into them.
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:50.000]   There is, I think, a fantasy on the tech knowing population that is, if only people knew, if only
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.160]   people had the option, then they would take matters into their own hands and refuse.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:02.400]   We're seeing more and every time I've seen one of those things. The cookies initially a few years
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:09.840]   ago and now the GDPR, it's well-intentioned. I think the implementation could be improved.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:19.520]   But after the initial burst of either outrage or satisfaction, people just stop caring.
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:24.640]   And I'm not saying it shouldn't be there. I think GDPR especially is good because it allows
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:31.040]   people like us to make sure we keep an eye on what's happening. So there's more transparency
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:37.280]   happening and that's good. But the idea that the general public is going to take matters into
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:43.040]   their own hands is a fantasy. Just like you're not going to go and repair your car yourself and
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.560]   know exactly how it works, you bring it to the shop and they do it for you.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.360]   By the way, somebody in the chair is pointing out and I know this, that the cookie thing is
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:56.960]   actually predates GDPR. I don't know what happened with GDPR that every site now does it.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:06.080]   It may be that GDPR has stepped up the enforcement or something. But now it's much more prevalent
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:12.080]   than it used to be. It used to be. We've had cookies disclaimers forever.
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.640]   I don't know. The all-fisty side I remember used to do.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.960]   And that might have been the first time I saw it.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:22.400]   And yet it stepped up. I see it. Now every site.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.600]   Your notices are lit. I think I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:34.160]   that has to be at least a third of the size of your website. You can't miss it.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:41.680]   And that's specifically because with the cookies, they would put a tiny little bar
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.480]   at the bottom that you wouldn't really see or care about.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:49.840]   So it's more obvious. I also think more American companies are doing it because
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.040]   there's now penalties for companies that do business in Europe, no matter where they are
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:59.920]   headquartered. And so that's why we're seeing that a lot more than we did before.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:06.560]   Let's take a break. Come back with more. Patrick Bejaw, not Patrick. It's only with time.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.680]   Three in the morning now. It's getting two, three in the morning now.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.600]   Yeah, it's only. But it's good. You got fired up with with GDPR.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:19.040]   Well, and I've learned something that the French invented movie pass.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:30.320]   So there you go. The business viable version of the one that works. You've had it for 15 years.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.520]   From Mashable, Michael Nunez is also here. He's deputy tech editor at Mashable. Great to have
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.520]   you, Michael. He's in New York. So it's not that late. Not that.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.880]   No, not too bad at all. Game of Thrones is an honor, anything. So you can stay late.
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.680]   Yeah. Yeah. And Harry McCracken, the technologist. Great.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.760]   Good afternoon here. It's mid afternoon. It's early. There's plenty of time left.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.520]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage. If you're home hunting, you may not feel like
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.040]   there's plenty of time left. You watch those interest rates kind of ticking up and thinking,
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:02.800]   if it goes up another quarter point, that's going to be thousands of dollars more. This home's
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:07.120]   going to cost us that might put some pressure on you. That's why the folks at Quicken Loans
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.640]   have decided they're very customer focused. They decided there's a better way
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:17.920]   to get you a home loan, a way that takes the anxiety out of it. They call it their power buying
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.160]   process. We've talked about Rocket Mortgage before, how it makes it easy to get a loan.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.080]   You could do it all online, even on your phone. You could do it from an open house.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:31.200]   There's several stages that are involved in this new power buying process. The first stage
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.640]   we've talked about before, you go to rocketmortgage.com/twit number two. Rocketmortgage.com/twit
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:42.160]   two. You answer a few questions. They have relationships with all the financial institutions. They just
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.160]   say, "Is it all right if we go get that information?" You say, "Yes, you don't have to go to the attic
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.080]   and pull out pay stubs or anything like that." They get everything they need. They say, "Yeah,
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:56.000]   good. Pick a loan. You're ready. We're ready." Within 24 hours, they then give you the next step,
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.080]   which is verified approval. At this point, you've got a letter. You could show the realtor. You
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:07.840]   could say, "Look, I'm good for it. I'm good for it." You basically have the strength of a cash
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:12.560]   buyer. That is awesome. That takes a lot of the pressure out too. When you're making an offer on
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:17.840]   a house, you know you've got the loan. Here's the best part. Once you qualify, you've got the all
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.880]   new rate shield approval. They lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop. You have three
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:28.160]   months and the interest rates can't go up. You have up to three months to shop. No pressure.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.760]   Don't worry about the interest rates going. If they go down, they'll go down, but they're not going
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.640]   to go up. It's exactly what you'd expect from America's best mortgage lender. Number one in customer
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.880]   satisfaction, eight years in a row according to JD Power, number one in volume two. They're
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:47.520]   America's largest and best. To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2. Rate shield approval is
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:52.800]   only valid in certain 30-year purchase transactions, additional conditions, or exclusions may apply
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.560]   based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records, equal housing lender,
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:05.120]   licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30. It's rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:10.080]   Rocketmortgage.com/twit2. We thank you so much for making Twit possible.
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:15.280]   Here's a little revelation. This actually happened months ago, but is now
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:23.360]   become public thanks to Reuters, the federal government, the Department of Justice asking
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:31.440]   Facebook for help wiretapping Facebook messenger. They want to hear a suspect's voice conversations
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:35.760]   in a criminal probe. This is according to Reuters who say three people briefed on the case
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:42.080]   said this. It was an unreported case in federal court. It's under seal. No filings are publicly
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:49.520]   available. Facebook, according to the source, is contesting the DOJ's demand. This is coming up
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:56.720]   in Fresno, California's part of an investigation of the MS-13 gang. Facebook's fighting. I don't
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:00.880]   know how long they can fight though. Ultimately, isn't this just out of their hands? The court
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:08.880]   will rule and Facebook will have to do it. This is similar to the FBI asking Apple to decrypt the
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:16.880]   iPhone. Isn't messenger encrypted though? Is it encrypted though? Okay. Messenger and what's
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.360]   app can be encrypted, but I don't think it's that kind of encryption that Facebook can't see the
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:26.880]   information. I'm not sure. So it's not then to end. I don't believe it's in the end. I think it is
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.960]   end-end for WhatsApp, but messenger. I'm not sure. It is end-end for WhatsApp and messenger.
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:36.080]   This is they want the voice calls, so I don't know what the privacy is. The fact that Facebook's
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:41.600]   fighting, it sounds like they can do it. Yeah, they just don't want to do it. Yeah.
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:48.080]   Anything to say about this? How do we feel about it? I have such mixed feelings because on the one
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:58.800]   hand you want to help police catch bad guys. It's not end-to-end encrypted and Facebook can
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:05.040]   give it and they're going through the proper channels. It seems like there's not a lot to be
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:11.600]   upset about. Is there? Yeah, I guess you're right. It's not encrypted. It's something else
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.200]   completely if Facebook didn't have access to it and they're being asked to provide a back door that
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:22.080]   doesn't exist. Right. Or if the government was saying you have to put in a back door for the future,
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:28.640]   that's a very different conversation. All right. Well, that was easy. Thank you, Pat.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.320]   You're welcome. Got that all. Be reasonable today.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:40.000]   Here's an article from New York Magazine. SEO is back. Thank God. Now, a few people might say,
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.240]   "Wait a minute. What's the thing about that SEO search engine optimization?"
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:52.960]   And the reason is this report from the Australian that Campbell Brown was in Sydney last week
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:58.560]   talking to publishers, actually specifically the Murdoch-owned Australian, saying,
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.760]   "We're not interested in talking to you about your traffic and referrals anymore.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:11.280]   That is the old world. There's no going back." She said, Zuckerberg's giving me a lot of leeway
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:21.840]   and concessions, but it looks like your business is dying. It's headed for the hospice and you can't
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:27.600]   count on us to send you traffic anymore. I believe Facebook said she did not say that,
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:32.400]   at least in those words. On the other hand, I've heard it from other sources. The Campbell
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:36.880]   Brown, who was, of course, a journalist for many years and now works with Facebook to liaise with
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:43.760]   the journalist, is being fairly blunt. We're not here to help you to drive traffic to you.
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:50.240]   You've got to solve your own business problems yourself. Don't expect us to come in and save you.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:54.720]   I don't think that that's so bad. In fact, this article in New York Magazine says, "Great.
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:02.080]   That old world, the world where magazines would put headlines in, designed to drive social media
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:07.680]   traffic," or you won't believe what happened in the next headlines. New York Magazine writes,
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:11.520]   "That old world absolutely sucked and it made the internet ecosystem a discernibly
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:18.160]   worse place." Sometime around 2012, the ecology of digital publishing underwent an
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:21.920]   epochals shift. I'd like you to talk about this, Harry, because you've seen this happen
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.480]   directly. Facebook overtook Google as the top traffic source on the web.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:34.560]   So in the past, you'd be doing SEO to get higher Google ranking. But SEO isn't all that bad.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.480]   It's according to this article, a guessing game, a digital jeopardy in which the person
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:43.440]   creating web content tries to think of the query that will get users to their web content.
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:47.600]   So that's why an article might be headlined, "What time is the Super Bowl?" as opposed to
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:52.480]   the Super Bowls coming up soon. But you could argue, "Well, yeah, you're trying to be more helpful."
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:01.120]   Instead, when Facebook got involved, the key to a good piece of Facebook optimized content was
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:07.200]   that it was emotionally intelligent, often in an exaggerated manner. It wasn't just 21 pictures
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:12.000]   that will make you feel good. It was 21 pictures that will restore your faith in humanity.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.200]   I did a story in all the things that would restore your faith in humanity once.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:19.280]   Did you really? Yes. For a while, that headline was just everywhere.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:25.120]   Everywhere. There was always just a very slapped together list of fun photos.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:31.280]   The author of this article, in fact, I want to give the author credit. Brian Feldman says,
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:37.600]   "For instance, when a writer pads their article for the trailer of the newest Marvel movie
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:44.000]   for SEO, they'll pad it with searchable keywords like the cast and crew in the opening date.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.480]   They're optimizing for SEO. But that provides genuinely useful information."
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.120]   It's a good piece. I think it is complicated. I think the worst
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:58.960]   Facebook-y headlines stopped working very well a while ago. You don't see anywhere near as many of
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:04.640]   them as you're used to. I always associate them with the site upworthy, which collapsed in the
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:10.240]   last week or two. Oh, did it really? Yes. Back in 2012, it was going gangbusters and those headlines.
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:19.680]   It was basically driven a way to become viral content. It started, ironically, by Eli Perrisor,
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:26.160]   the guy who wrote the book about the filter bubble. I understand this. Let's create a company about
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:31.040]   it. I also feel like, ultimately, you should write headlines that will accurately describe your
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:36.720]   way, your stories, in an appealing way, which is of interest to human beings. If you do that,
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:41.920]   and you're being accurate, that's an entirely moral thing to do. It has the side benefit of
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:48.960]   also helping you on Facebook and Twitter and Google. It's being deceptive or cheesy. That's a
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:55.280]   bad thing. That has not worked well for a while now. BuzzFeed used to have headlines like that,
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.120]   but BuzzFeed overall, the quality of their content and the quality of their headlines
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:04.400]   both improved recently. I'd agree. It turned out that cheesy stuff was kind of a dead end.
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.920]   Feldman writes, "It was difficult for any publisher to resist, given how much traffic
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:14.720]   the Facebook system brought to others. Now, by Facebook's own account, the valve to the fire hose
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.120]   has been closed. Great. Use it to build brand-earned awareness or whatever, but otherwise,
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:24.240]   it's time to recalibrate and leave the reliance on Facebook as a traffic source behind." I think
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.440]   that's well written. I mean, readers learn. And good news. People got really jaded.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:33.280]   Once they noticed that there were all these headlines on Facebook that were entirely
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:38.080]   deceptive and which led to junk. And when they didn't stop them from sharing it.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.800]   Well, I think over time, it did a little bit. It certainly, at first, it was helpful.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:48.240]   I remember for a long time, the studies were that people don't read the articles they share.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.160]   They just look at the headline. If it sounds interesting, they pass it along.
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:56.080]   It doesn't mean, I mean, to this day, sometimes I will post something on Twitter and people will
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.360]   share it within three seconds, clearly not having read my article.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:01.840]   Yeah. You didn't have time.
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.560]   I mean, hopefully that's a sign that they're sort of vaguely aware of us,
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.720]   company or of me and have some faith. Maybe that's it.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.600]   That headline is intriguing. It's a good story.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:10.320]   It's definitely it.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:19.920]   Jan Koom, who was one of the founders of WhatsApp and kind of gotten a little tiff with
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:24.320]   Facebook over advertising and what's App Facebook wants to do it. Jan Koom does not.
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:30.560]   There's also some issue about, we were talking about encryption in WhatsApp and whether Facebook
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:37.040]   maybe would do end to end or not. He quit in April or said he was quitting in April,
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:41.120]   but according to this article in the Wall Street Journal, he continues to show up once a month.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:49.280]   Now, remember, Facebook bought WhatsApp for money and stock, which skyrocketed to over $22 billion
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:54.560]   for an app. I think that's still the record price paid for an app.
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:01.120]   Koom has been there for three and a half years. As usual in this kind of acquisition, the stock
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:05.120]   doesn't vest all at once. You don't get to use it all at once. It's kind of spread out over a
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:11.760]   period of time. So apparently Facebook spokesperson, a client declined to comment on Mr. Koom's schedule,
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:16.720]   but said he remains employed at the company working on various products and helping transition
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:25.520]   WhatsApp leadership. Here's why if you're Koom, you want to show up. He still has about 450
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:30.320]   million dollars worth of Facebook stock that he hasn't cashed in. Actually, he's set to
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:35.600]   collect it right about now, two and a half million shares. It's contingent on him being employed at
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:41.520]   Facebook. So he's still showing up. They call it rest and vest.
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:46.240]   Yeah, I'd like that schedule if possible.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:50.240]   He's living another world entirely, don't they? Wow.
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.200]   I don't blame him. You don't want to turn down that much money. Koom is worth about
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:52:00.480]   nine billion dollars. Co-founder, WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who quit a while ago,
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:05.920]   were three billion dollars. Near there, one of them though, one advertising or WhatsApp. I
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:09.200]   don't think there is advertising yet, but I think it's just probably a matter of time.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:13.680]   Actors. Well, they have to make money. You got to make money.
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:17.680]   With it at some point. 99 cents a year is not big bucks.
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:21.840]   Which they charge me. They're already made money through that. No, they don't do it.
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:24.480]   No, they scrapped it, I think. It's free now. Oh, is that fair?
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:33.280]   Mr. Acton resigned in September, leaving behind, get this 900 million dollars in unvested shares.
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:39.360]   Nine. Now, that's a principled stand. Walk away from 900 million dollars.
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:45.280]   Let's see. What else is going on in the world of tech?
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:52.560]   An Acton is the bigger critic of the two. He's been the one that says,
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:57.440]   get off Facebook. Not just, he's not just, he's just get off Facebook. Yeah. Yeah, I kind of love that.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:01.280]   Are you still on Facebook though? You work in Mashable, you have to be.
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:08.880]   I am. Yeah. Ultimately, Facebook is something that I love and that I'm fascinated by.
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:13.680]   But I'm also, I'm critical of it because I enjoy it so much.
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:20.320]   Yeah, I'm not, I'm deactivated, which is why I'm here today instead of at the Tech TV reunion picnic,
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:24.080]   which is going on right now in Golden Gate Park, but I didn't know anything about
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:32.640]   because I'm not on Facebook. I mean, these days you're not missing out on that much. I feel like
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:37.440]   what I've kind of noticed is there's been an interesting migration to Instagram. I feel like
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:43.920]   at least anecdotally, you know, the people that I know are moving from Facebook to Instagram and
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:47.920]   then like the younger people that I know are just skipping Instagram, skipping Facebook altogether
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:51.280]   and going straight to Instagram. Instagram doesn't seem to be nearly as
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:58.880]   negatively impacted and packed full on your life. That's how I know about what Patrick's baby looks
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:06.880]   like. Well, Instagram is really obviously focused on pictures, but they even don't show you the
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:14.400]   comments of people who you're not following unless you specifically tap on the show more
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:21.200]   comments thing. It's not about, and you can't really share links or anything like that. It's the
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:28.880]   kind of the best parts of Facebook. You just see, you keep in touch with family and friends
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:34.480]   through pictures, which is the quote unquote good part of Facebook. So it makes sense.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:40.480]   Yeah, I like pictures. Let's see, Ajit Pai tells the Senate why he lied to them.
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:49.600]   Oh, God. You said, I didn't want to, but I had to. I had to. I was told I couldn't tell you.
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:59.920]   So this goes back to the net neutrality regulations and FCC opening up their comment area for comments
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:04.720]   and John Oliver saying every again for the second time everybody should go there and tell them
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:12.160]   preserved net neutrality. So many people did the site went down, could have just been
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:17.760]   traffic too much traffic. It went down the first time too, right? Instead, the FCC said we were hit
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:25.200]   by a cyber attack. It was a DDoS and we can't accept any more comments. That's it. We're done.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:32.720]   Pai went before a congressional committee for the first time this week since
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:39.040]   a internal investigation found that the agency misled the public by claiming it was a cyber attack.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:52.400]   Ajit Pai said, I couldn't tell you. I was told I was bound by a request for confidentiality by the
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:59.360]   Department of the Inspector General. The FCC, Pai said, "Wanted to get this information to you sooner,
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:05.360]   but I made the judgment we had to adhere to the request, even though I knew we would be falsely
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:13.840]   attacked for having done something inappropriate." What? No, it's a little bit.
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:22.080]   How is this? First of all, they claimed it was a DDoS and they weren't
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:28.800]   claiming it was the CTO who was saying it was a DDoS, but he knew it wasn't a DDoS, but they
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:36.000]   said it was a DDoS anyway. Then there was an investigation that said, "Okay, it's not a DDoS,
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.320]   but you can't say it's not a DDoS." Then in the end, they said they didn't worry about any of the
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:51.120]   comments. This makes no sense at all. None of it makes sense. We were talking about the dark
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:59.120]   patterns and the way the companies confuse you. That's what it's doing. Am I crazy? That's what
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.400]   he's doing. I wouldn't care so much if it weren't as important that net neutrality be preserved.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:10.640]   Yeah, exactly. They have an obligation to—my understanding—I'm from Europe, so I'm not exactly
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:19.120]   sure my information is accurate, but my understanding is the FCC is supposed to legally take into account
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:23.920]   the comments that they have on the decision. That's for sure true.
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:31.840]   They didn't. The comments were overweighted. They were in favor of preserving that neutrality.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:39.520]   Right. Whether or not it was automated or not, there was something happening that should have
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:46.960]   legally made them take a minute to try and understand what the comments were. If they're legally
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:53.760]   done, they didn't want to look at the comments they used. This is a pretext for ignoring all
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:58.320]   comments and doing what they really wanted to do in the first place. Everyone knew it wasn't a
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:08.400]   DDoS. We all knew that. It's worth saying that this is pretty common in American politics right
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:15.120]   now, too, which is the strategy is to lie now and then apologize. Yeah, it's like, "Well,
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:18.720]   there is no apologizing." I'm glad you're cut up. I'm glad you're cut up. I'm glad you're cut up.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:27.520]   Yeah, exactly. They just find this strategy to go out of that lie later,
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:34.560]   long after the lie has been made. It's super disappointing when it comes to leaders doing this
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:40.640]   important tech issues because this is the thing that's going to carry the country forward in a
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:48.000]   lot of cases. We should be the guiding light or we should be laying the foundation for the rest
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:56.400]   of the world to follow when it comes to a lot of these things. Instead, we're just... I don't
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:02.080]   know, man. It's really disappointing when I read stuff like this because I just think that it's
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:08.240]   hurting people in ways that they probably don't understand. Yeah, the Federal Appeals Court has
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:17.600]   stayed an FCC decision pending appeal. The FCC said that they were going to kill tribal subsidies
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:26.720]   for Lifeline Internet access, a $25 a month Lifeline subsidy. The court said, "No, can't do it. We're
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:31.040]   going to have to go back to court and fight it. The tribes and the small carriers who provide
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:37.440]   the internet to the tribes had sued the FCC saying there's a substantial risk. Tribal populations
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:42.880]   will suffer widespread loss of vital telecommunications services if the state isn't approved." It was.
[01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:51.440]   So a little victory there. Let's take a break and I've got the bits and pieces including some amazing
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:57.680]   inventions and the annals of technology. But first, a word from an amazing invention in the
[01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:04.240]   annals of postal service. You wouldn't think there'd be a new and better way to do stamps,
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:10.320]   but there is stamps.com. We're not talking a postage meter. We're talking about buying and
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:16.320]   printing real US postage. The minute you need it using your computer and your printer from stamps.com.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:20.400]   In fact, you get all these amazing services to the post office right from your desk
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:25.360]   anytime of the day or night whenever you need it. You could buy and print official US postage for
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:31.120]   any letter, any package, any class of mail. The mail carrier still comes and picks it up.
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:35.760]   Actually, it's even better than that because regulations require that if you have a package
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:38.880]   greater than a pound, you can't put it in the mailbox. You have to bring it to the post office
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:44.240]   unless you use stamps.com. Mail carrier, pick it up no matter what size. Stamps.com suggests
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:49.040]   ways to save money. You can actually get discounts you won't even get at the post office.
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:53.920]   It fills in all the forms for you for international mailing and certified mail.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:59.680]   No equipment to lease, no long-term commitments. You'll even get a digital scale
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:05.280]   that automatically calculates exact postage. It looks great. You can print right on the envelope.
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:10.800]   The return address automatically printed a corporate logo if you want. It'll take the address of
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:16.160]   this recipient from your address book. Fill it in automatically for you. A lot less typing.
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:21.680]   A lot faster, a lot more professional looking. Prints out labels for packages. We have an amazing
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:27.680]   special offer. That includes $55 in free postage. That digital scale I mentioned. And a four-week
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:33.040]   trial. All you have to do is go to stamps.com. Up in the upper right-hand corner on the website,
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:38.480]   you'll see a radio microphone. Click that. Enter to it. And you're going to get an amazing offer.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:46.560]   They're giving you $55 in free postage just to try stamps.com. We use it here and you will love it too.
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:52.560]   There's no better way to do everything you would do at the post office right from your desk.
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:57.360]   stamps.com. Enter to it. And you're going to get an amazing offer.
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:05.360]   World's smallest transistor switches. This is amazing story. Intel has had some trouble.
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:11.600]   It's the one atom one. One atom. Intel has had trouble getting 10 nanometer parts made. They
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:16.400]   say maybe next year, much of the chagrin of Apple and others who depend on Intel parts.
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:22.800]   Scientists in, I assume this is Holland at the Carl's Roo Institute of Technology
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:28.320]   have come up with the world's smallest transistor switches. Now, it's one atom,
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:35.680]   which is about a tenth of a nanometer. So that is 100th time, one-one-hundredth the size of even
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:41.440]   the chip that Intel can't make. One atom repositioning that single atom in a gel
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.960]   works as a transistor. But even more importantly, they've done this before at absolute zero, 273
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:53.520]   degrees Celsius below zero. This is at room temperature, which means it consumes very little energy.
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:03:02.720]   In fact, a significant factor less. This quantum electronics element enables switching
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:08.560]   energies smaller than those of conventional silicon technologies by a factor of get ready 10,000.
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:19.840]   So imagine getting 100 times more storage in the same size at a
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:25.440]   10,000th of the electricity. This sounds really good. Now, I don't know what the
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.640]   manufacturing situation is, but I think that's an important breakthrough. I just wanted to pass that
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:38.560]   on. It does feel like this is a kind of fundamental research kind of thing that,
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:44.400]   just like we hear about exciting, incredible new battery technology, and we've been hearing
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:52.240]   about this for 15 years, is this actually going to turn into something that we can lose in the
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:57.040]   next 20 years? Yeah, I never know. By the way, Karlsruhe Institute of Technologies in Germany,
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:05.120]   I apologize. It's in Karlsruhe, Germany of all places. Or is it Karlsruhe? I'm not sure.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:11.760]   They deserve that credit. No, it's funny because remember we were all excited about that cross-point
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:18.560]   technology until it announced the 3D chip technology that would increase the density.
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:24.080]   And it took a few years, but it's obtained. Until it has announced it, it's going to ship it,
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:29.760]   or it's shipping it. Some of it already. IBM tends to announce breakthroughs that sound
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:34.400]   incredible. And I feel like we need to go back and follow up on them. See where they lead?
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.240]   Supercapacitors. We were all excited about that about five years ago.
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:45.040]   Now there's a supercapacitor in the S Pen in the Galaxy Note 9 that allows you to charge it
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:50.400]   in 40 seconds. So I do think these things get out here. We should probably pay more attention to
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:55.920]   how long. Who knows? I mean, maybe there's all sorts of issues with single atom transistors,
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:59.920]   but I just think that's a fascinating story. I had to mention it.
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:07.040]   There was another invention I wanted to talk about. Maybe it was this, the
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:14.000]   digital birth control app that is only 93% effective, but has now been approved by the Food
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:21.840]   and Drug Administration. Maybe it's that one. What? Natural cycles. It's from Sweden. It's up
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:28.240]   your way. It's from Sweden. It's the rhythm method. You've probably heard of this.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:35.600]   It includes a thermometer and an app and you take your temperature and it tells you if you're fertile
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:44.320]   or not. If it's used perfectly, natural cycles says it's 99% effective, but under typical use,
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:52.000]   93% effective. And in fact, one hospital in Sweden reported 37 cases of unwanted pregnancies among
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:06:00.480]   women using the app. But it is approved. According to natural cycles, 900,000 people use the mobile
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:04.560]   app. Let's see. 900,000 with a 7% rate of pregnancy.
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:13.600]   Ooh, that's a lot of babies. Well, I guess it's approved doesn't mean that
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:20.880]   the FDA is saying this is a method of birth control. It's an app that tells you, if you use it
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:28.640]   normally, you're going to have a 93% chance of not having a baby. And it states this pretty clear.
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:36.080]   They're clear. Yeah. I guess it wouldn't be the place for the FDA to say, no, you can't
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:41.520]   sell this or you can't. Well, they could say, you need to have some disclaimers on here,
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:46.400]   be more clear about how effective it is. The rhythm method is not new. For a long time,
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:51.040]   I don't know if it's silicase. It was the only contraception method approved by the Catholic Church.
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:52.560]   It may still be the case. I bet it is.
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:07:00.000]   See, ISPs say they can't expand broadband unless government gives them more money.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:06.320]   Enough said. Your sigh was sufficient.
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:19.680]   The, you know, the irony/goal of them doing this a few months after the
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:28.320]   net neutrality issue, which in part was implemented because the idea was, well, we need to invest
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:33.600]   more so we can have any kind of government regulation or restriction because then you're
[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:43.120]   going to kill the internet. And it is, you know, I don't want to say bad things about America on a
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:48.640]   panel that has the Americans and you alone, but no, no, we're right there with you.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:52.640]   Patrick, we're right there with you. Speak freely. You're fine.
[02:07:52.640 --> 02:08:00.320]   Martin Marcich. He's an Italian. He was arrested August 8th in San Francisco as he was flying into
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:06.960]   town. He's accused of hacking electronic arts, the video game company. The judge posted bail
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:15.360]   of $750,000 worth of Bitcoin or any other kind of cryptocurrency.
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:21.120]   It's the first time we know of in the United States that Bitcoin has been requested for bail.
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:27.520]   Apparently, cryptocurrency is now accepted in federal court. Just thought you'd like to know.
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:32.720]   Why did they request Bitcoin? Was it because he was, he had Bitcoin and no money or?
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:44.960]   Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I think the IRS stated that Bitcoin is property and not currency.
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:49.040]   So you're allowed in this country to post property is bail. You could say I want to give you.
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:53.600]   Right. So there you go. Okay. So that's that's probably how it worked out. Yeah.
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:09:03.440]   Judges can order many kinds of bail. According to this article in the Daily Post, I don't know
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:11.120]   where the Daily Post is from, but I trust it. And it looks like steam is going to do another
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:20.240]   streaming gaming service like Twitch, like Amazon owns Twitch. What was it? It was caffeine TV.
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:24.880]   And now a steam valves steam. Steam TV was briefly as well.
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:30.320]   Mixer from Microsoft, right? Steam was briefly live showing the Dota 2
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:36.480]   competition, but it was an accident. Valve said that was just a test feed that accidentally went
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:42.320]   public. However, those who saw it said it worked pretty well. So get ready. Steam TV is coming.
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:48.960]   I like it because we are on Twitch. We're on mixer. We're on YouTube. You know, these services
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:54.560]   doesn't just have to be gaming. They allow us to stream free. I like it. I think it's a good thing.
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:59.840]   Ironically, we were on Ustream for many years and now IBM is charging for their streaming.
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:03.600]   It's not free anymore. So it's a good thing. There's others.
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:07.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the logical conclusion of this show.
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:13.840]   I want to thank you for being here. Thanks to Patrick Bejach, Bejach who stayed up late.
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:20.560]   Stayed up always a pleasure. Way, way too late. I appreciate that. The baby's not there.
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:25.280]   What would you do? You'd be playing Call of Duty, if not, right? If not doing Twitter.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.760]   I guess, well, the latest World of Warcraft expansion came out.
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:36.960]   I know you're a wow guy. What is the new expansion? Is this the battle for Azeroth?
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:41.920]   That's it. Yeah, exactly. I've been waiting for the battle for Azeroth.
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:50.320]   I've been spending a little bit of time playing that for work. I do gaming podcasts.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:58.800]   I had to. Obviously. So is this a four consecutive days? This is the world you go into, right?
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:04.000]   And there's other people. It's an MMORPG, right? Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.960]   And so what is battle for Azeroth? Is it new lands or what?
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:14.960]   Just a quick disclaimer. I used to work for Blizzard a long time ago now, but I did.
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:20.480]   So that's an ethical statement. But yeah, it's a new expansion. So usually what they do is that
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:27.200]   they add a new landmass, a new number of levels that you level through, and a new adventure,
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:32.960]   a new narrative thread that you go through. And this one is pretty good. They divide
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:37.920]   between the two factions of the game, the Horde and Alliance, and they give you two entirely
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:43.600]   different continents to explore. So the rivalry is very strong. And it's working narratively.
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:48.080]   It's pretty like it. You're playing. So how many hours do you play World of Warcraft?
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:54.800]   Well, when a new expansion comes out, it's usually all in for a few weeks. And
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:12:02.800]   in the past four days, it's been, I would say, can I say, it's a little more.
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:07.680]   A little more. Yeah, a few hours a day. What's your character? What's your main character?
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:16.000]   I've been playing my mage, human mage, which I'm not super entirely satisfied with. I might go back
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.080]   to the druid. So we'll see. Now, the last time I played World of Warcraft 70 was as high as you
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:32.480]   can go. This lets you go to 110 120. Yeah. But they've been pretty clever. What they do now is
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:38.000]   that basically with every new expansion, they give you a character boost that brings you to the
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.080]   level you need to get the beginning of the expansion mark. You don't need to worry about
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:47.840]   anything else. You just buy the expansion and of course, pay for your subscription,
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:52.880]   which I'm guessing they hope you will forget about just like every other subscription you have in
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:13:05.280]   your life. So my level 12 thief, I can get in there and play. You could boost it up to level 110
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:10.560]   and start adventuring. So now we know why Elon's not getting much sleep.
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:13.200]   It was about for Azeroth.
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:20.160]   Duh. Patrick, tell us about French spin. What should people do if they want to catch your work?
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:26.400]   I do so many things. I guess I'm going to tell you about a couple of them. First, if you enjoy
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:32.640]   gaming since we were talking about this, you can go subscribe to Pixels. It's a gaming news show,
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:37.040]   which I do every couple of weeks with Gamescom coming up. There's going to be a lot of news. You
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:44.000]   can subscribe to the podcast called Pixels. If you speak French or are learning French,
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:51.040]   what better way of practicing than listening to a tech podcast in French? That's Le Chant d'Eun
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:14:00.320]   Tech. You can see it at frenchspin.fr, the French site for my podcasts. I do a weekly show about
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:04.560]   tech in French. That's an easy way of practicing this wonderful language.
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:10.320]   Yeah. And the Philly is club, too, where you talk about the news of the world.
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:15.600]   The news of the world with lots of different people from different places,
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:20.320]   and that's often enlightening and depressing at the same time.
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:25.200]   I didn't ask you, and I should have, what you thought about Fortnite on Android deciding to
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:30.880]   bypass the Google Play Store, which seems to me puts Android users at a little bit of risk
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:34.880]   in order to make a little bit extra money for Epic Games. You agree?
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:43.600]   Yeah. It's a complicated issue because Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic, has always had a strong stance
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:49.680]   against these stores that he feels kind of control the OS a little bit too much.
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:57.440]   And so he has a ground to stand on when he's saying this. At the same time, the 30% obviously
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:02.960]   is something that is difficult to swallow when your game is already the biggest thing in the world,
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:06.160]   and you're probably going to get people to install it no matter what.
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:12.160]   The problem isn't so much that as what happens afterwards. Actually, Google did something
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:20.000]   really smart and really good for security. On the App Store, now they say, if you search for
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:26.800]   Fortnite, they say, we don't have the game on the App Store, so don't bother installing those other
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:32.480]   apps. It's not available because there's a lot of free riders pretending they're Fortnite.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:38.160]   But I guess it's complicated because in OpenOS, obviously, you can let people
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:44.480]   install apps from wherever they want. But what we've learned is that it's safer for people if
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:47.440]   they're a little bit restricted. So I don't know. It's a tough one.
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:50.960]   It is. Yeah. Thank you, Patrick, for staying up so late. I appreciate it.
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:55.760]   Thank you so much. And thanks to Michael Nunez for staying up late. He's got a big work
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:16:00.960]   day tomorrow. Deputy tech editor Mashable. He's at work right now. Thank you. Appreciate it,
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:06.000]   Michael. Yeah, thanks. It's been a lot of fun. Obviously, it's not quite as late as it is in
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:12.000]   France, but yeah, it's the evening and it's been a blast. This is always a good time.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.720]   Anything you want to plug? Any podcasts you're doing or anything?
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:20.960]   Yeah. Well, we're working on a podcast weekly. It's called MashTalk. That's run by my
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:26.160]   boss, Pete Patchel. What else do we have going on? Yeah, just some interesting reporting.
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:34.560]   Definitely check out Mashable Tech. I recently launched a little side project, a t-shirt shop
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:40.480]   that I'm experimenting with for targeted ads. You can check that out. It's called brooklynvibeshop.com,
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:45.280]   if you want. I don't know. I think really just stay tuned to Mashable Tech. I think we have a
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:49.200]   couple of stories that I'm really excited about that we'll hopefully publish this week.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.240]   And so hopefully you'll see those in the Twitter sphere. And if you like them, share them out.
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:17:01.680]   And follow all of our writers. They deserve a lot more attention than they often get. So,
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:08.640]   give us some love. I want the Hetch O'Unbrooklyn shirt. I like it.
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:16.800]   Yeah, you found it. Yeah. So, it's a reason to, it's given me a reason to just experiment with a
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:20.800]   little more with targeted advertising. Do you do Instagram ads with this?
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:25.520]   I do. Yeah, actually, just started. How's that working for you? Is it too early to tell?
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:32.560]   It's too early to tell. I just started this weekend. But what I can tell you is that you can
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:40.800]   reach about 50,000 people for 30 bucks in this band. Wow. Five to seven days. So, the real
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:45.440]   question is how many people need to see a product before they actually click through and buy it.
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:50.480]   That's something that I don't have a firm understanding on. But I at least am getting a good gauge for
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:55.360]   how many people this stuff will reach for just a couple bucks. I'll tell you why I ask.
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:18:01.920]   For some reason, middle of the night on Instagram, I buy so much crap on Instagram.
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:07.120]   Same. Honestly. So, this is a project. I don't know if it's because I'm weak because it's three
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:15.360]   in the morning or what. I know, yeah. It's becoming the, as seen for TV, sort of marketplace.
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:20.080]   It's my home shopping network. But a real key, and I don't know if you do this,
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:23.200]   it's got to be easy to pay. If I have to enter a credit card number, I'm not going to do it.
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:29.040]   But if it's got Apple Pay or Amazon Pay, some quick way of paying, you got me. I'll buy whatever
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:35.680]   crap you got on there. Yes. Oh, that's exactly how I am. So, yeah. So, this shop has Apple Pay.
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:39.440]   I think I'll add Amazon Pay. Apple Pay is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:48.480]   I bought a $2,000 electric bike with my fingerprint the other night. It's terrible.
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:54.000]   Oh, that actually sounds pretty cool. Oh, it is cool. That one. I love thinking.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:59.600]   But, yeah. What I noticed was that I was seeing these shops pop up more and more,
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:05.440]   especially clothing. There's all these clothing brands that grow really quickly.
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:10.960]   That's where I get my bamboo underwear. Yeah, exactly. And for me, it's t-shirts,
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:16.080]   usually. But occasionally, it gets some weird stuff like handmade sandals and all this other
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:23.120]   stuff. I was constantly seeing this in my feed. And I just started as just a fun project.
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:28.560]   And really, it's just an open experiment. It's something for me to really just like,
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:32.960]   it's a fun side project. But I also am learning a little bit more about the AdTech. So, it's been
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:39.360]   fun. Throwboy, do you sell on Instagram? Throwboy is in the chatroom of Roberto Hoyos. He makes
