[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.000]   And I have no social life.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.720]   So this is pretty much it.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.280]   I'm so pleased to welcome Steve Kovac back to our studio.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.720]   Steve's at businessinsider.com.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.000]   We're sitting in a beautiful brick line study.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   It's gorgeous.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Thanks.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Actually, it's my living room.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But yeah, it's nice.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I love this exposure.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.640]   It's like I'm in a comedy club.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.480]   Yeah, we'll call it Kovacs.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.480]   Kovacs chocolate.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.480]   Perfect.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.680]   Thanks for being here, Steve.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.800]   Also with us Jason Heiner from Tech Republic CBS interactive.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   Nice to see you Jason.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.600]   Great to be here.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   As ever.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   We've got a new chapter out in the book.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   We'll talk about that.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   Absolutely.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Love it too.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.400]   Did he go through a few months of nothing or was I just not paying attention?
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.120]   No, chapter seven last month was Chase Jarvis.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.680]   That chapter still up for another 48 hours.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.240]   He's one of my favorite photographers.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.000]   He's amazing and just an awesome human being and great digital leader, innovator too.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.040]   Where do we find that great book?
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.280]   FollowTheGeeksBook.com.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   And chapter seven just for a couple more days.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.760]   New chapter coming.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.280]   Chase Jarvis.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.880]   We interviewed him a couple of times on Twitter photo.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.040]   I just love him.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.080]   Yeah, Fabio's guy.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.200]   Also here, Anthony's wife.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.560]   I'm trying to give back Georgia.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.560]   Georgia Dow is here.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   Oh, Anthony's going to love that.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.840]   She's from i'mward.com.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.720]   Her husband, Anthony.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   I've just learned for the first time.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.720]   Yes.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.200]   Was a caller to the old call for help TV show.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.560]   He took half a day off work.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.320]   He waited by the phone and we never called him.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   You never called.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.760]   He's still waiting.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.000]   I'll let him call him later.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.360]   You can actually ask the question that he's going to ask.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.800]   What was his question?
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   I've got Windows 98 and I'm trying to decide whether I should upgrade to service pack too.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   I don't know.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   He ran IT.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.880]   So it was probably something probably a little bit more technical than it could have been.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.160]   Besides writing for iMore, which has become my go to place.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.800]   I mean, of course, Renee Richie is there.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   Serenity's there.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   George is there.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.960]   But it's become my go to place for like useful how to information on Mac and iOS.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.280]   But George is also a psychotherapist and she's a is this a new enterprise for you?
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   Anxiety-videos.com.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.840]   Yes, we just launched this video.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.200]   So it's myself and it's Sandra Ries.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.880]   She runs Montreal Center for Anxiety Depression and she's one of my closest friends, my mentor.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.080]   She's absolutely a phenomenal therapist.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.560]   And so this is for people that may be dealing with anxiety but are too shy to go in to see
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.720]   a therapist.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.560]   So you can download the video and deal with your anxiety at home.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.760]   And also it's a good adjunct.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.720]   So if you're dealing with therapy and you know, you want to remember something or you
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.080]   want to deal with sleep or some certain set, you can get one of the videos and help yourself
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.160]   that way as well.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.920]   Because that's my specialty.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.120]   This is all we do every day is just really mainly deal with anxiety and depression.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.920]   So you know, it's something that we're pretty good at.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.480]   And so we're hoping to be able to help more people.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.200]   I mean, I think people know about depression, but anxiety is so debilitating and so many
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.360]   people suffer from anxiety disorders.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.640]   And it really, it's not just panic attacks, but all sorts of phobias and just PTSD.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.640]   It's just terrible.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   OCD.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.000]   There's many different aspects to it.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.160]   And it's just it's all people from living lives.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.800]   Anxiety is like a game of risk and it just takes larger and larger territories from you.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.000]   And some people never leave their home or won't even leave their bedroom.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.120]   Most of our viewers actually.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.640]   So we we're talking to you.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.600]   Go to anxiety-adios.com.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.400]   Let's talk about tech news because that's what we're here to talk about next week.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.440]   Many of you will be flying to San Francisco.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.920]   Apple sent out the invitation.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.320]   Oh, you know what I need?
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.280]   Could you get me my iPad?
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.240]   So the invitation reads, hey, and I'll say the S, I'll say Shlomo, okay?
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.160]   But you know what I'm talking about.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   S-I-R-I.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.320]   Hey, Shlomo, give me a hint.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.880]   And they announced that it's going to be September 9th.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.640]   We kind of thought it would be September 9th.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.640]   That's kind of when they always do it.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.200]   First week of September, in this case, not a Tuesday because Monday's Labor Day.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.680]   So they're going to do it on Wednesday.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.480]   The big surprise was Bill Graham Civic Center, which is a 7,000 seat venue.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.200]   But of course, as soon as I saw the invitation, I had to try this.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.960]   I mean, let me ask Shlomo something.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.200]   Give me a hint.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.800]   You're cute when you're desperate for information.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   Give me a hint.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   Why don't you check a rumor's blog?
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   That's what I do.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   Give me a hint.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.640]   I can neither confirm nor deny that I am not authorized either to confirm or deny that I
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.160]   cannot disclose anything that she would then have to confirm.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160]   In any case, I would deny it.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   Got it.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.960]   I kind of like it that Apple's got a little sense of humor, but this is the one.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   Give me a hint.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   What?
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   You can't tell from my colorful wavy words.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   That's not the one.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.040]   Give me a hint.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   The only hint I can give you right now is the hint of lime and that there's a big announcement
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   on September 9th.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   They actually built into Siri that there's a big announcement September 9th.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   Did that go live that day, the day the invitation must have?
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   Well, no one got to try it before, I guess.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   I mean, I'm assuming you were live that day.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   You have to really take.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   Siri's calling the web, right?
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   I guess they could, in real time, they could update Siri at any moment with an update.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.960]   It's not like they have to wait for us software updates.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   It's probable that after September 9th, she'll say something else if you ask her for a
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.960]   hint, right?
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.960]   Probably.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   I think it's really in vain.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   It's good marketing, I got to say.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.960]   Yeah, because people love to be involved in something, and so this pulls people in.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.460]   So it's not something that you're getting to watch, you're getting to interact with it
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.960]   being a little bit of part of the event, and it's something cute on their part.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.960]   So let's speculate.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   We've got three good speculators here, and then me.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   I never get anything about Apple, right?
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.960]   But let's speculate.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   A couple of question marks.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   Why such a big venue?
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.960]   And why is Shlomo so prominent in the invite?
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   Because Apple TV.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960]   Apple TV.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.960]   It's all about Apple TV.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.960]   I think that's going to be one of the headliner bits for the event.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.960]   Is Apple TV in Siri in Apple TV?
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   Steve, you agree?
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.960]   I mean, I think that's going to be the focal point.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.960]   The iPhone 6s, pretty much everything is like that already.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   It's just going to be iterative of over last year's model, which was a big change.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   So I think a lot of the focus is going to be on the TV, and specifically maybe their
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   Siri controls, maybe they taught it something really cool.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   It's kind of weird thinking about talking to your TV.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   It's been kind of done before Roku has it and stuff, but still a little awkward.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   Maybe they could--
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   Sire TV has it.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.960]   Roku has it, and Microsoft-- Xbox One have it.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.960]   They all have.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.960]   Yeah, Xbox, too.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   But it's terrible in Xbox.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   Oh, I use it all the time.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   But I use it for commands.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.960]   I don't use it for like a place.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   I don't tell it, you know, let's watch Duke's a hazard.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.960]   But I say things like pause, play, rewind that kind of stuff.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.960]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.960]   That kind of stuff works.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   I mean, Fire TV though, the search on Fire TV.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.960]   That's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   It works pretty remarkably.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   You know, you just speak into that remote, you hold down the mic, you speak into the remote,
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.960]   and it's remarkably accurate.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   They've done some good work.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   I don't know if they're licensing.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   This is one of the questions I sort of have that I've been trying to figure out is like,
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   are they licensing their voice recognition software, or do they have their own voice recognition
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   division doing a bunch of research?
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.960]   I assume they're licensing it.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   It's probably a combination of the two that are licensed.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   Was it nuanced?
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   It was nuanced.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   It is nuanced.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   Okay.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   Well, it was.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   I don't.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   So that's a good question.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   Remember, Siri was an acquisition.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   Siri was a very cool application.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   Did even more than today's Siri.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:11.080]   You could make dinner reservations with the app.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.480]   And I believe that that was nuanced based, but I do feel like Apple has slowly moved to
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   it.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.720]   This is Apple's way, right?
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   Slowly moved to its in-house stuff.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:26.080]   I mean, the thing that Amazon not only is Amazon Fire TV good, but you know, with the
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.800]   Echo, you know, that's remarkably pretty good as well.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.240]   And some of that may have to do with all the mics.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.000]   There's all those extra mics in that.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.600]   So it could be that it's part, you know, it's somehow it's getting the audio data in better
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.440]   and more clearly and then, you know, interpreting it better.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.920]   But Amazon's doing good work is the bottom line.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.600]   And so there's pressure on Apple to respond because the Fire TV is a good device and Apple
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.760]   TV is, you know, I've actually always liked Apple TV.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.560]   I think there are people who put it, but I found it super useful and the interface a
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.160]   little easier in general than like Roku.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:13.080]   But with Amazon Fire TV and sort of the newer layers of, you know, Netflix, for example,
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.320]   which is a lot of what people are accessing on these devices.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:23.640]   Anyway, you know, Netflix itself, their native UI is a lot better.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:33.280]   And the Fire TV UI seems to have used a lot of those same kind of, you know, models from
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.120]   the Netflix, what Netflix has done.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.720]   And it works really well and it works seamlessly.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:43.400]   So Apple, certainly the pressure's on for them in the TV game to get it right.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.280]   And what they seem to have put most of their eggs in the basket right now is in making better
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.920]   deals with content providers.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   And they've done a good job with that.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.880]   They've added a lot of channels.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.240]   There are a lot of channels on Roku.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.520]   There are a lot of channels on, you know, on Fire TV as well.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.920]   But Apple has a lot of the really big, you know, it's a big hitters.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   I wonder if I'm the only one.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.800]   I'm really hoping that the Siri hint is that Siri is going to be a better digital assistant.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.400]   I, you know, using it for my TV, that sounds nice, but I don't mind looking for the remote
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.080]   in the couch somewhere.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:24.120]   I really want Siri to be able to help me manage my life, not miss my appointments.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.560]   No one traffic is going to be too late or, you know, remind me to call, you know, this
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.880]   person because this meeting has been moved up because I noticed in your calendar, that's
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.160]   what I'm hoping that Siri is going to give me.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.440]   I feel like we're really on the cusp of breakthroughs in voice recognition.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:48.000]   And it's interesting actually, cord cutting, voice recognition, home automation.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.400]   They're all converging on a point, aren't they?
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.800]   And certainly the Apple TV would be well positioned.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.960]   Although in my opinion, one of the reasons I don't like the Apple TV is it's so tied to
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   the Apple ecosystem.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.520]   I mean, it is really an eye.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.440]   It's the only way you can watch iTunes TV and movies connected to your TV.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.160]   It doesn't support Amazon streaming, which is, I think, critical.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.080]   They do have HBO and Showtime.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.040]   I feel like it's been left a little bit behind, a little neglected.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.040]   This is an opportunity.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.040]   I totally agree.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.040]   Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.280]   It's, I mean, when I test the Roku versus the Apple TV, Roku just blows it out of the
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.280]   water.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.280]   It's between the search is so much better.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.440]   You can just search something like a director and actor and you get all the sources from
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.880]   where you can find that director or actor or movie or whatever it is you're looking for,
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.360]   whether it's Netflix or Voodoo or Amazon.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.920]   And again, like you said, Apple is just tied into iTunes.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.720]   And whenever someone asks me like, which one of these little boxes should I buy, I say
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.160]   unless like you have all your stuff already in iTunes and you just want to be able to
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.320]   watch on your TV, go with Roku because you just have more options.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:03.560]   One little thing that Apple TV does better than anybody else is Netflix.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.120]   First of all, everybody does Netflix.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:12.280]   But Apple TV, and I was told this actually by a streaming video guy, Apple's the only
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.560]   company that actually has in-house caches of Netflix content.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.360]   So that you're when you're watching Netflix on an Apple TV, you're getting it from Akamai.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.440]   You're getting it from the Apple CDNs.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.440]   And that I had no idea about that.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.440]   I didn't either until he told me, he said, you want now that may be changing because
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.680]   remember Netflix has its own kind of competing technology where they put servers in the
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.000]   ISP's knock and so forth.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.040]   But Apple did this first and this guy told me if you want the best Netflix, I wish I
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   remember his name, I can't.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.760]   But if you want the best Netflix streaming Apple TV, and I have to say, I agree, Apple
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.920]   TV seems to be the most consistent.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.120]   Also, I still feel like it has better content.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.600]   It doesn't have as good a search.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:58.240]   Like Steve saying, I think the search is better on Roku and now the voice search on Amazon
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.400]   is much better.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.280]   But I do still find that there's more and better and higher quality content on Apple
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   TV.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.000]   Because iTunes has more than, it's a one to one.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.840]   It's iTunes versus Amazon store when you're going.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.000]   And they both do have things that the other doesn't.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.040]   And it could be me and I'm sort of older than the stuff that I like, which is a lot of documentaries
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.200]   and history and things like that, right?
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.160]   Or more on Apple TV than on the Amazon.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.920]   But I find that a lot of that stuff is better content and also channels, the channels they
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:39.440]   have to connect with places like NBC, you still have to have a cable subscription to
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:44.320]   do it to connect with NBC and PBS and other places like that.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:52.680]   I feel like the interfaces and the experience, in some cases, even the content, isn't on
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.840]   Roku or Amazon.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.920]   Like I said, I use all three.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.440]   I typically do the same thing as Steve.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.240]   I recommend Roku to most people just because I think it's super simple and it tends to
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.920]   be cheaper.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:11.920]   So but I do think Apple has an opportunity here and they see it that if they can, they
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.440]   have to catch up, I think, to Amazon with the voice recognition and with some of those
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   other things.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:23.400]   But they have an opportunity to sort of go over the top and skip cable providers.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.160]   Apparently, we're not going to hear that and get that yet at this that all those deals
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.760]   aren't done, that they were supposed to be done by WWDC and some of them are still on
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.320]   the bubble and we're probably not going to see that until 2016.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.920]   And so with that, that leaves us with the Siri becoming the main event.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.200]   But not only I think Siri, but that also has to do with exactly what you said, Leo,
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.200]   is home automation.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:56.320]   I mean, we've heard some indications that a lot of the Apple home stuff is tied with
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.520]   the new version of Apple TV.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.480]   It is reportedly more expensive.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.400]   It's a little bit larger box.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.120]   It's more expensive and that's probably to do with the other piece, which is that you're
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.360]   going to actually finally be able to run apps on this thing, which mostly means probably
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.520]   games, right?
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   So it's probably a faster, more expensive box with more hardware and more RAM so that
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:24.680]   it can run games, so that it can run apps, as well as maybe some of the Siri processing,
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.200]   even though a lot of that's done in the cloud.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.200]   But that makes it all a pretty interesting thing to see which direction they're going
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   to go.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:39.440]   I feel like Apple is at this point giving up on the rest of us and focusing on the Apple
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.600]   ecosystem.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:48.160]   But for instance, HomeKit will not obviously interoperate with anything but HomeKit stuff,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.160]   right?
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.040]   It's going to be an Apple product designed for Apple people.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:59.200]   Apple is, from everything I see in Mark Gurman has a recently pushed article at 9 to 5 Mac
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.680]   about the new features.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.560]   This is playing catch up, as we've said, with everything that already does all this.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:14.360]   But people who live in the Apple ecosystem will say, "Yay, we can now talk to our TV.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.200]   Yay, we can do voice search," because they live in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.640]   It's almost as if they're on an island and they don't know what else is out there.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.600]   They're very, very happy to get these new features, even though most of us will say,
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.680]   "Well, there's nothing new there."
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:38.560]   The cat was, maybe Stevie can answer this, the common response to that is, "Well, yes,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.080]   but Apple waits and then does it better."
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.560]   Is that still true?
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.040]   I don't know if that applies to the Apple TV, because it's just been slagging behind.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.200]   I don't know what they can do.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   That's much better.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.280]   Maybe again, these Siri controls will be a lot better.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   But I do--
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.680]   Gurman says they're going to charge 200 bucks for this.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.720]   That's twice as much, more than twice as much as the Roku.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.160]   And then at the same time, the App Store could be a big deal, so you'll finally get your
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.760]   Amazon on there and maybe some other third-party content stories.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.080]   Will Apple allow that?
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.600]   Well, Amazon allows that.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.040]   I think they'll have to.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040]   Well, I think they'll do it.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.040]   Amazon--
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.040]   I'll give you an example.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:19.160]   Amazon is a very crappy experience on Xbox One, because Microsoft says, "If you buy an
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.520]   Amazon title on the Amazon app, you give us 30 percent."
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.120]   That's exactly what Apple will say.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.800]   If you use the Amazon app on Roku, which doesn't take a cut, it's a much better experience,
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.680]   because you have the full-- you have the store.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   There's no store.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   And there won't be a store.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.720]   I guarantee you, on the Apple version, because Amazon's not going to give Apple 30 percent
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   of everything it sells.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.920]   It'll be like the iOS version with this.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.280]   It's only the stuff I've either bought through Amazon or that's available on Prime.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.280]   It's not a good experience.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.080]   And if I want something new to pop up on here, I have to go to Amazon.com, buy it or rent
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.000]   it or whatever, and then it pops up.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.920]   So that's a terrible experience, because Apple is like Microsoft does.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.480]   And it's confusing to people, because I, of course, I like you guys.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.880]   I have everything.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.400]   And it's a very confusing experience, because not for me.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.240]   I know why this is happening.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:16.080]   But Lisa will try to buy something on, she'll be watching Amazon on the Xbox One, and she'll
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.840]   say, "Well, why can't I buy, I can't, I don't see the store.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.920]   Where's, I only see Prime?"
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.960]   And I have to explain, "Well, that's because on this platform and on that platform, and
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.280]   that's a bad way of doing things."
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   It is bad.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.760]   And whole automation is the same game, too.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.040]   So, you know, this thing's very, very bifurcated, right?
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:43.760]   The content experience between, for this on-demand kind of content, that's why I think everybody
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.920]   uses Netflix, because, you know, it's pretty simple, right?
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.440]   And it's straightforward, even if it doesn't have as much content in some stuff.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.560]   But, you know, it's very bifurcated.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.640]   Smart Home is even worse.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.440]   It's like, for different ecosystems, right?
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:05.040]   And, you know, the Apple Home Kit, and then also, you know, now Google.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.080]   Well, Google's on Hub, presumably.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.520]   I mean, they've got Zigbee, not Zigbee, they've got Z-Wave.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.120]   They've got one of the two built-in, 802.15.4.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.520]   So Google will presumably be a little bit more open.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.920]   Smart things, that's the Samsung solution, is designed to talk to Z-Wave, Zigbee, and
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   many other things.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.640]   And so is Wake.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.640]   Wake is multi-protocol.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:33.880]   And I know at iMore, Georgia, the Serenity has tried some of the HomeKit stuff.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.880]   HomeKit's more open than one would expect from Apple, I think.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.080]   It's more open, and, you know, you have to trade off, right?
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.280]   So you're trading off security for a pain in the butt.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   And that may appeal to people.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.280]   And that may appeal to people.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.280]   That may appeal to people.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   Yeah, it depends.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.040]   Like, you know, we just installed Skybell, which is an amazing service.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.000]   But then I was reading through their privacy policy and all of the videos.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.400]   Like, every time, if Skybell is a home automated, you know, doorbell, and, you know, you ring
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.840]   the doorbell, you get to see it on your, you can talk to the person and see the video on
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   your watch.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.080]   Well, the watch only sends you a message, and then on your phone, you can see the video
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.760]   of who's there, and you can talk to them.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.160]   So if you're lying down bed and, you know, telemarketers come by your door, you can just
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.200]   say, "No, thank you.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.280]   Leave, and you don't have to get out of bed," which is fabulous.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.280]   But they store everything on their own server.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.480]   And I'm like, "Well, what happens to this?
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.800]   What happens to all of these videos when people come into my home?"
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.680]   And you know, I'm more security conscience.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.320]   I think that it's something that we need to discuss.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.240]   So, you know, if Apple's going to make sure that everything's secure, I don't mind waiting
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.240]   for that.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.760]   I think that we often give up our own privacy for the short-term gain, and I don't know
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.000]   if that's always the most intelligent way to go through it.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.280]   I am going to take a stand against privacy.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   Somebody's got to.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.280]   Somebody's got to.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.280]   Alright.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.280]   Someone asked you.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.200]   You look at me and Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.200]   I feel like...
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   And Google.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:07.600]   Everybody's so paranoid that nothing good can happen because everybody says, "Oh, you can't
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.280]   do that, then you'll know what somebody's reading on the Internet."
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.680]   And I just like, "Dudes, don't look.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   Look.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.680]   Look.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.080]   Don't you want hell, 9,000?
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.880]   You want to have a conversation with your house?"
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.960]   Well, guess what?
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.000]   If you do that, it can't do it by itself.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.320]   It's going to have to go out to the Internet where people might hear you.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.800]   Oh my God!
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   So what are we going to do?
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.520]   Not have hell, 9,000 because of you guys being so paranoid?
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.520]   Yes.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.520]   How is that?
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520]   How bad?
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.520]   How about...
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.520]   That's true.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.520]   How did it kill everybody?
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   Maybe not the best example if you're trying to tell them to give up their rights and freedoms.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   Okay.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   Never.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:53.960]   By the way, that was Dan Rayburn of the streaming media blog who's the one who filled me in on
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   the...
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   Oh, he knows his stuff.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960]   He knows his stuff.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.280]   Now, it may not still be the case, but Apple for a long time was paying Akamai.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.080]   So when you got Netflix on an Apple TV, you were getting it not from your ISP, in effect.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.480]   You were getting it from a CDN.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.880]   And it wasn't a better experience.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   It was a really interesting...
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   Hey, let's take a break.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   I'm having fun.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   I hope you are too.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.960]   Georgia Dow is here from iMore.com and anxiety-videos.com.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.320]   She's going to be here when I have that big, nervous breakdown any minute now.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.920]   So you can watch her and medicate me by remote control.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.840]   Also Jason Heiner from techrepublic.com, CBS Interactive.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.000]   We got to find out about the new book.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.320]   Oh, we did find out about the new book.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.320]   Chase Jarvis.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320]   That's exciting.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   The new chapter.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   That was seven.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   And we'll talk about eight.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   Oh, you got...
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.480]   Are you going to tell the world?
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   We did.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.480]   We just announced eight this morning.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.480]   Okay.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   We'll find out.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   Stay tuned.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.480]   Stay tuned.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   Stay tuned.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.360]   I'm Stephen Kovecke is also here from Tech.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.680]   You just changed where you're from.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   There's a new site.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680]   What's techinsider.io?
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.400]   It's the new site from Business Insider.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.560]   I'm one of the deputy editors there now.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.240]   Should we pronounce it techinsider.io or techinsiderio?
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.400]   Just techinsider is good.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.200]   Yeah, they're showing it on the screen now.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.360]   It's pretty.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   That's our new site.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.360]   It's pretty.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.080]   It's BI's first spin-off site and a third one is coming soon.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080]   Interesting.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.160]   What's the focus of this?
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.720]   The broad theme is innovation.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.720]   Let's just say that.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.720]   That's the best way.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.920]   So science, culture, consumer tech.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:30.360]   Well, and absolutely appropriate to start with memories of Oliver Sacks.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.280]   How's there's a...
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.080]   Well, neuroscientist.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.200]   He actually wrote his own bit, obituary, which is kind of interesting in February and the
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:43.880]   New York Times because he discovered that his cancer had metastasized and he knew that
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.880]   he was...
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.440]   That there was no cure and that he would die sometime this year.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.200]   What a brilliant guy.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.760]   I interviewed him once.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.080]   He came in bright red suspenders on his big motorcycle.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.520]   He was quite the character.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.320]   And if you've not read any of his stuff, including the man who mistook his wife for
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:06.760]   a hat, all his PBS stuff and just a really great guy who lived fully right up to his
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.920]   last days.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.960]   Really remarkable fellow.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:19.560]   He did exactly what you'd expect him to do and just a sweet guy, quite a character.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.800]   Let's take a break when we come back more from those fabulous panelists.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   But first a word from FreshBooks.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.800]   If you're a small business or a freelancer, this is really for freelancers.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.880]   This is when I discovered FreshBooks.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.200]   When I had to send at the end of the month, I had to send out invoices.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.000]   The worst part of the whole...
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:44.280]   I loved having many jobs, doing lots of different things I hated, having to open up Microsoft
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.120]   Word and Excel and create and spread sheet and send it out.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.440]   I'll let you stamps, put it on the envelope.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.760]   Hope you get paid.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.520]   When I discovered FreshBooks, and it's been a while now, it was just a revelation.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.600]   FreshBooks lets you do invoicing easy, simple.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.280]   You create these great professional looking invoices.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   You send by email.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.980]   Every invoice has a "Pay Me Now" button that makes it very easy for your client to
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.980]   pay.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.520]   Turns out clients want to pay you.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   They don't...
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.080]   Paying the bills is as awful as making the bills.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.440]   So if you make it easy for them, you're going to get paid faster.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:21.460]   In fact, FreshBooks users get paid on average five days faster.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:26.640]   If you're keeping hours, you're tracking time and hours, the FreshBook app will do that
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.880]   for you and automatically insert it into the invoice.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   Great for expenses too.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.740]   You could take pictures of the receipts, keep track of expenses, get them into the invoices
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.740]   well.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.760]   It is a super simple cloud accounting program that's giving thousands...
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.120]   The program's not the right term site.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.400]   I don't know what you call it.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.680]   Software as a service that's giving thousands of freelancers like you the tools to save time,
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.200]   billing and get paid faster.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.560]   Create and send invoices and minutes.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.920]   Organize your expenses easily.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.520]   Track your time instantly.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.440]   I'm telling you, you're going to wonder why you didn't start sooner.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.680]   And the FreshBooks award winning support rock stars are there waiting for your call.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   They're fabulous.

[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   There they are.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.040]   Love them.

[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.540]   Just say, "I heard it on Twitter."
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.620]   This week in tech or something like that.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.140]   Start your 30 day free trial today.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.460]   We thank them.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:32.620]   FreshBooks, we thank you so much for supporting this week in tech and the Twit Podcasts.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:40.540]   Any more to say about the big, actually, you know, maybe even of more interest, frankly,
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:45.480]   I'll probably get the new iPhone mostly because I sent my old iPhone because he broke this
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.480]   again.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.480]   He's waiting for it.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.720]   Well, he said, "Dad, are you going to get the new iPhone?"
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.280]   I said, "Well, of course."
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.440]   "What are you doing with the old iPhone?"
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.640]   I knew I've heard that sound before.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.780]   I said, "I'll send it to you now," so I sent it to him.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.220]   So I will be, I'm going to think I'm going to get the bigger one.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.020]   "Is this a six or six plus?"
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.020]   Which one you got on?
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.860]   I got the six and I really liked the six and I was, for a while saying, "Don't get the
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:17.940]   six plus because it's just bigger because Apple's, because the apps don't really take
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.940]   much advantage of the bigger screen size."
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.020]   But I think that's changed over time.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.620]   And more and more apps that take advantage of the extra pixels.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.860]   It sounded like a big phone.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.860]   I'm using a Note 5.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.860]   I like big phones.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.860]   I'm not lying.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.280]   Those other brothers can't deny.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.280]   But I'm going to...
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.280]   Yes.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   How did you know?
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   I just, I don't know.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.080]   Everyone was jamming their pen and they're all...
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.320]   No, there's no jamming involved.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.520]   That was the thing that I thought, "Oh, because I read the articles."
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.160]   Film that concerned and Android Central is the first.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.720]   And I read that.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.560]   And if you put the pen in backwards, you can break it, right?
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.220]   And I thought, "Well, I'll just show how easy it is to get it in backwards."
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.220]   I won't put it in...
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.160]   Because at some point I thought, "Well, it's going to fight me."
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.160]   No, it just falls right in.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.160]   And then don't laugh.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.160]   It was so funny.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   It was so funny, Leo, because when I was researching and I was looking at videos so
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:17.600]   I being who I am wanted to see people dropping their phone in when they're doing their box
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.600]   opening.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.600]   And so then I see...
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.600]   I'm like, "Magick Weekly."
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   I'm like, "Oh, okay.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.360]   So I looked through and I got to see you."
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.680]   I'm watching him like, "No, he didn't."
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.400]   And then I'm waiting and I'm waiting and then it's just...
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   Well, no, he didn't.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.400]   Oh, yes, he did.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   He did it.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.960]   So I got to watch you do the unthinkable.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.200]   And I think you can tell I wasn't making this up.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   I didn't expect it to happen.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.600]   I wasn't intentionally breaking my phone.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.720]   But what you don't realize is there is no resistance.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.320]   It resistance is futile.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.400]   As you let it fall in, and then as you're pulling it out, suddenly you can't get it
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   out.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   So I did not yank it.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.400]   I did not pull it.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.840]   I went to the AT&T store where I bought it and said, "Please, sir, I seem to have something
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.480]   stuck in my phone."
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.520]   And they said, "Well, what do you want us to do about it?"
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.040]   I said, "Well, fix it.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   Wait, don't do repairs here.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.080]   You could send it to Samsung.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.080]   See it three months later."
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.640]   "Just go to the Samsung store."
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.160]   Then I said, "Well, okay.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.240]   But don't you have like if you don't like a phone, you'll take it back."
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.640]   They said, "Well, we won't take it back like that.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.320]   But if you were to remove the pen and put it back in, we'd take it back."
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.040]   But then I couldn't have the phone and I liked the Note 5.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:32.720]   So I walked away, hanging my head, and I slowly, gently kind of, and it didn't fight me.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.440]   It just kind of came out.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:41.320]   But in fact, there's a little teeny, meanie plastic hook that gets caught, and I broke
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   it.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.840]   But you know what doesn't really make that much of it.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:49.000]   I saw someone take it out really nicely if anyone else is doing it by cutting a sliver
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.200]   of a piece of paper.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   Right.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.080]   And then they slid it onto and then they fed it in and then they pulled it out.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.720]   Yeah, you can do that because you can push that lever back before you remove the pen and
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.400]   kind of protect it.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.240]   I didn't do that.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.280]   But it's not the end of the world.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:11.680]   The only thing you lose is the sensing that the pen's been removed, which has some slight
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   benefits.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.440]   But the pen still works.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.800]   You can still press the pen button and all the pen applications pop up and all that stuff.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.120]   So it's not the end of the world.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.440]   And by the way, I gained a little battery life because I then turned off pen detection
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.920]   and settings and my battery life went up by like an hour.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.920]   It's a feature.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.040]   So now there's going to be saying it's a feature.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   But what do you think?
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.760]   Is that a...so there's a lot of debate over this.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.200]   A lot of people said, well, you're an idiot.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.200]   You put it in.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   Don't put it in wrong.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.320]   But I feel like this could easily, you know, you're not looking and you just...that was easy
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   to do.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.320]   No, that's...
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   So is it bad engineering?
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.320]   Or is it user error?
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.320]   It's bad design.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   No.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.640]   If it's that easy to make the thing malfunction, it's bad design.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.920]   No question.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.320]   Should they recall these?
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   Should they...I'm sure they'll fix it in future editions.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   No, they should.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   We call them.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.320]   It makes no sense.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.240]   If some of the best people in tech are putting their phones, their pens in backwards and
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:14.520]   having this happen, then what do just the regular people expect to have happened like
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.520]   me?
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.520]   It would happen immediately.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.240]   Well, Samsung's response was read the manual, except that it doesn't come with a manual.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:25.360]   You have to read the manual in a PDF online, which nobody's going to do.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.240]   Nobody reads manuals anymore, right?
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.200]   We've been trained not to.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   You shouldn't be able to do this, I think.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   However...
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   You're in technology.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   No.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   I'm not...
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.800]   Good technology is supposed to protect me from myself.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   That's good technology.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   Well, this did not protect me.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.600]   They should know that people are going to put the pen in backwards upside up and try
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   to put it in sideways.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   They should not allow that.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.520]   What they had to do was just make it a little bit wider in the base.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   That's it.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.600]   It wouldn't take that much or change the manner in which they had the little tiny sensor
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.160]   latch on the inside.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.120]   Compare this to antenna gate, the iPhone 4 problem.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.120]   It worse better.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   Same.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.120]   Same.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   Oh, I'm the same here.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.160]   I think it's worse.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:11.200]   The iPhone 4, you had any phone if you hold it to block the antenna, it's going to get worse.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   This one is...
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   I don't know.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.400]   I also feel like an idiot for having done it.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.800]   I believe the people say, "Leo, you're just an idiot.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.280]   You shouldn't have done that."
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.840]   Yeah, it's a chase pin in the chair.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.120]   It's user error all the way.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.680]   There we have it.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.840]   I like this phone.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.920]   I really like this phone.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   In fact, it still works exactly as before and I still use it.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.360]   If you don't want to have the pen, you can still get the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   Which is awesome.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.160]   It's the same phone with no pen.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   So...
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.480]   I mean, you accidentally hit that edge with that screen a lot of times and then do weird
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480]   things.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.480]   But it looks fabulous.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.720]   I mean, that thing just looks like a beauty.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.720]   I would say...
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   I would say...
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.080]   I would love to get the book.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   Let's talk.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:11.240]   Let's talk fabulous a little bit because we were talking about that if you're going to
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:16.280]   get the S6 or the S6 Plus and you're saying you're going to go for the S6 Plus, which
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.720]   you're going to have to pay like what?
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:24.680]   $850 for something to get one that doesn't have 16 gigs, which apparently these base
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.280]   models are going to come out with, which is ridiculous.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.320]   But the Fablet thing is just so real.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.800]   I've never...
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.760]   I sort of used to laugh at Fablets and I find myself more and more really one-on-one
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   and I...
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.760]   People locked me.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:48.960]   I've had every note since the note one and now this phone is not as big as the note one.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   No, it's bigger, right?
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.360]   It's five points a hundred inches.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.360]   It's bigger.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.960]   And nobody laughs at me anymore if I talk like this.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.960]   But it looked weird at the time, but now it's like...
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.800]   It's everybody's doing it.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.680]   We discovered that we're more productive with a bigger screen.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.120]   It's easier to read.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.640]   It's easier to use.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.280]   And frankly, this is the computer we spend more time on than any other computer in our
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   life.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   We don't have one of my ZDUs.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.040]   Yeah, I mean, I agree that...
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.080]   I was one of the ones that laughed at you for the Fablet, sorry, Leo.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.160]   But it's like, the more I...
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.720]   So I've carried an iPhone and an Android phone since 2010 and then we obviously all
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.040]   of us get lots of testers in and the more time I've spent testing some of these Fablets,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.400]   I'm like, "Boy, it really is nice having that big screen."
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.880]   I find myself reading more on it.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:45.760]   I find myself answering emails on it a little more or longer ones because with that little
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.880]   bit of your screen, you can manage the keyboard a little better.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.920]   And so, yeah, for the first time, I'm sort of thinking for my every day...
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.560]   You're going to get the 6 Plus?
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.000]   I may actually get a Fablet.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.800]   Also, I do think it's an interesting time if we're talking about phones and then I'll
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.240]   shut up and let the other guest hear what their perspective is on these two.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.840]   I think it's an interesting time because with contract, Verizon go in, no contract.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.120]   You know, T-Mobile is essentially the same direction.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.920]   Others are going to follow clearly.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:21.120]   You know, all of a sudden, the price of these phones is going to be a lot more...
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.520]   People are going to be more sensitive to price than they are currently.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.520]   And I think that that actually hurts Apple and Samsung or Wilbur.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.000]   Oh my God, this phone is 850 freakin' box.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Right?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Exactly.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.360]   Where's you looking at something like the Moto X Pure Edition?
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   Another beautiful phone.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   More of it.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.360]   Too much.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.760]   400 bucks.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:47.800]   And that is a super powerful phone, very well received.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   I think if...
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   Or I think it...
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.040]   I expected it's going to be well received.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.960]   And I think that if you're a consumer and you're wanting to upgrade your device and
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:02.960]   you're looking at 400 versus 850 in this device, even if it's 90% as good or...
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.320]   I think the perception of it is going to be that it's, you know, really close.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.920]   You know, I think there's no doubt people will choose something like the Moto X Pure
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:19.000]   Edition or maybe a Huawei phone or whatever over an $850 iPhone 6 or Samsung, you know,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   no 5.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.040]   Well, and as we've mentioned, part of the reason is because they're seeing the actual price.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.640]   Now that subsidies are starting to go away, you actually will be seeing the actual price
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.640]   you're paying.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.240]   And I think once you know what you're paying, it's like you're kidding.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   That costs more than my desktop computer.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.240]   Yes.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.240]   350 dollars.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.240]   Are you kidding me?
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.680]   Leo, that's not the question I want to know though.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.520]   If rumor has it that they're going to go with the rose gold...
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.320]   Are you going to go with rose gold?
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.480]   You know why?
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.720]   First of all, I'll go with whatever I can get because rose gold will definitely be out
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.800]   of stock within five seconds of midnight on Friday the last...
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.200]   Oh, just for the novelty factor and looking unique, right?
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.760]   No, because think about it.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.360]   If you buy a new iPhone, high priority is that people know you have the new iPhone.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.100]   And the only way that we know that is if you have the rose gold one, everything else
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.440]   looks just like the old ones.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   Right.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   Because like the white...
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   Remember when the white came out?
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.480]   Everybody got the white because it was like...
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.960]   It was the niche show.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.640]   Apple's finally learned this because I think in the early days they thought, "Oh, nobody
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.120]   will buy whatever the weird color was."
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.680]   Now they know that's the one.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.880]   That's the one you make the most of.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   And I'm sure that they're doing it like that.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.480]   Well, you get the prestige factor.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.800]   You're buying it and it's nice to have other people say, "Oh my goodness, do you have the
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   new one?"
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   Whatever it might be.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   Did you get it flowing?
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   And it's always painted pink.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.160]   It's a beautiful color.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.640]   The rose gold is not pink.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.600]   It's like a bronzeish.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.600]   It's not an over-colored...
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.800]   You haven't even seen it.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   You haven't even seen it.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.040]   If it is the same as the color is...
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.040]   As they say, which is like the watch, it's a beautiful color.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.880]   It's not the watch because the watch is actually rose gold.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   This will be aluminum.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.120]   It will be rose gold.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.000]   Can it make rose gold fashionable again?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   There's an editor on my staff, Tina Hammond, who used to actually be a fashion editor.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.400]   And she's like, "Rose gold is so out.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.520]   Rose gold is out for like 10 years."
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.520]   They're called.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.520]   And I was like, "Really?"
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   I was like, "I had no idea."
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.520]   What's in?
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   Did you ask her what's in?
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.160]   Because I'd like to know.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   What's in?
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.960]   This is a good question.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.360]   But she said rose gold was the thing.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:29.360]   I guess it was like 10, 20 years ago was really a thing.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.360]   Is that true, Georgia?
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   But in action accessories.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   Your fashion forward, is that true?
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.360]   I don't know if I'm that fashion forward.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   Yeah, I'm not that into rose gold.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.000]   I never was, though I would get the phone in rose gold.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.360]   Well, you know that Christina Warren finally got her pink leather.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.760]   Yes.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   You guys are nuts.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.240]   You Apple phone people are nuts.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.040]   Apple watch people.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.600]   Oh, any worse than any other techy?
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.600]   You guys is nuts.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.600]   Not.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.600]   Yeah, it's worth a bad one.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.200]   How many bands does Renee Richie have now?
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.800]   Okay, well, that's true.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   I think that he has eight bands, perhaps.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.000]   I think he has eight bands.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.320]   What's the DSM-7 diagnostic for somebody who has too many watch bands?
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.160]   I would call him passionate.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.160]   Yeah, passionate.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   That's it.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.160]   It's so difficult.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.080]   It's nice to have fun.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.400]   Technology can be a lot of fun and enjoyable.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.440]   And when you find something that matches me when I found my little watch band from like
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.760]   Etsy, I was so excited.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.840]   And it was fun and affordable.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   So why not?
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.280]   Mention I'm more get 20% off with that.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.280]   True.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   Etsy pioneer in 1956.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   Stop it.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.280]   I'm more excited.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:44.120]   Actually, you should do it because I know people will want it.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.560]   It's actually a pretty nice band.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.720]   I mean, I just have the white one, right?
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.720]   You have the white one?
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.720]   The white one?
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   It's just pretty.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.360]   I have the transparent one.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.600]   It's really, it's so beautiful.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.640]   You don't even, I stopped wearing my Apple watch.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   Did you?
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.640]   This is dopey.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.200]   So here's the problem.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   You know, people expect, I actually tweeted this last week finally because I've had a
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.560]   lot of conversations about the Apple watch, obviously.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.920]   And I was, you know, I was pretty much a skeptic going into it.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.400]   Although I've worn fitness bands since they started, I wonder if it's since they started
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   coming out.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.560]   But the problem with the Apple watch is mostly expectations in Apple.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.560]   Some of this is Apple has to blame for.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.360]   People expect it to be an iPhone on your wrist when it's actually just a smarter version
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   of a Fitbit.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.520]   If you're expecting an iPhone on your wrist, you're going to be disappointed.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:37.480]   And even Apple, I think with some of the things they tried to do in apps, you know, overreach
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   a little.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.720]   It was a little too ambitious and this device does not have enough power and the UI is not
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:48.800]   well thought through enough to work with some of the ways that they'd like to do apps that
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.560]   could get better in the version of software that's about to be released.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.560]   2.0.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   2.0.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   Come out next week.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.560]   Is that going to be part of the night?
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.560]   Yes.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   Well, I'm not throwing my watch away.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.760]   In fact, I've ordered hearing aids because I am, if you hadn't noticed, an older person.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.440]   And the hearing aids that I bought work with an iPhone.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.440]   Wow.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.440]   So not an an...
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.920]   You're bottles that do that.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   They have an Android app, but it's not as good.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.920]   Now, how do they work with the iPhone?
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.280]   A couple of things.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.720]   You can play anything that's on your iPhone.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.280]   You can play back goes through the hearing aids.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.760]   So it's like Bluetooth headsets.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.760]   It's like a Bluetooth headset.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.760]   It's like a Bluetooth headset.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   Nice.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.760]   I don't know how good the sound fidelity is.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   I asked the guy said, "Oh, it's great, but I don't..."
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   You know, we'll see.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.760]   I tried them at CES.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   I actually tried some of those at CES.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   Yeah, how do they sound?
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.760]   I thought they were pretty good.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.880]   I thought they were pretty amazing.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.520]   You know, the cool thing is they also work to...
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.680]   You know, they're trying to integrate these with TVs too.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.920]   You're an elderly person with the hearing aid.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.040]   It used to be everybody was in the room, right?
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   They'd have to turn it up real loud for the person.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   Which matlock on?
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.040]   They wouldn't ask, right?
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   I can't hear it.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   Turn up matlock.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   Turn up matlock.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:58.480]   Well, now they can actually hear it in many ways better and more clearly, you know, at a higher
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.200]   fidelity than even the people in the room because your hearing aid can grow.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.120]   I will hear better than you all.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.120]   Damn you.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.480]   The other thing it does is it has 20 egeolocate.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.880]   So you have 25 different presets for different locations.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:17.560]   So you can change these EQ for background, noise, whatever.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.080]   It does a weird thing, which is it...
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.360]   The ad copy is not politically correct.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:28.760]   It says, "For children and women with high voices, we'll automatically lower the pitch
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:33.200]   into your hearing range so you can understand children and women better."
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.200]   That's horrible.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.200]   I can't hear you.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.200]   What?
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   What?
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.200]   I'll speak to you right now.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.200]   I can't hear you.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.200]   I can't hear you.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.840]   From now on, all women are going to sound like this.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.360]   Daddy, Daddy, my children.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:49.240]   I thought you were going to say that for women and children, it just turns them off.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:53.120]   I think it's probably a feature as well.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.120]   But I may end up...
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.760]   For this reason, it has an Apple Watch interface.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.400]   So you can on your watch say, put in pre-shit number four, a much in matlock.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.160]   And so I think that's going to be kind of cool.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.400]   iPhone and Apple Watch.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.280]   I may end up wearing the thing again.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.640]   To me, that's the Apple Watch.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.520]   It appeals to people who have a specific use that it works for.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.520]   If you have a specific need.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.680]   It's good at two things.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.320]   I've written about this.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.360]   I did a video about it and all of that.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:28.080]   It's good at two things, which are alerts.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.840]   The alerts are good.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.360]   The alerts, and because of the app ecosystem on the iPhone and the watch itself, it gives
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.240]   you a diversity of alerts.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.280]   It helps you keep you from missing calls, to keep you from missing calls.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.280]   Next, I don't like that.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.280]   It's too annoying.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.080]   It's constantly beeping and booping on my wrist.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   I don't want to...
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.760]   You have to tune it a little bit.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.080]   For me, I take out my phone a lot less.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.080]   You know?
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.880]   You all sound so freaking lazy.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.040]   All these people say, "Oh, I don't have to take my phone out of my pocket."
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.680]   How much trouble is it if you wish to look at your phone?
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.680]   Have you seen my first...
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   It's a lot of trouble.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.160]   I keep my phone right here in the next to my heart.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.520]   Find where my phone is in my purse.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.520]   Take it out by then.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.960]   The call's already left.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:11.960]   It's gone to voicemail.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.440]   That means I have to go through all my voicemails to hear what happened.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.880]   I get to check it out on my wrist.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.680]   I can say, "Oh, I can curate.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.120]   Do I want to answer the phone right now?
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.120]   Is this important?
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   Is it not?"
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.800]   Then I can decide if I want to search through my purse because it's important enough and
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.880]   I need to deal with this call or not.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.720]   It saves me time.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:30.960]   I like that.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   More than I thought I would.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.000]   I kind of like to not fit bit when fit bit had started to do some of this too and I liked
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   it on that.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   This is just a little bit more sophisticated version.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.480]   Same thing with the fitness tracker.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.080]   It's just a little bit more sophisticated version of the fitness tracker and the back
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.760]   end, Apple's health kit is better.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:53.640]   It pulls all that health data from your tracker into health kit and then health kit can feed
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.240]   it back to apps like lose it and other things.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:02.040]   Then you can get a larger picture of your health kit.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.560]   If you drunk the cool-aid boy, oh boy.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.560]   Wow.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.120]   How neat is that?
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.600]   By the way, my hearing aids will do that too.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:18.880]   There's only two things though that it's really good for.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.520]   That's what I say in my piece.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.560]   If you want to use it for those two things, you're in business.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.000]   If you wanted to do other stuff, it's just not there yet.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.080]   That's kind of my attitude.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.480]   There are a few specific use cases that make a lot of sense.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.840]   Fitness is one of them, although I don't think it does anything more than.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.200]   In fact, it's not even the best-selling fitness band.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.440]   This is what gets me.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.400]   And Apple's going to say, "Hey, we're number two."
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.400]   Fitbit outsells them.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.600]   According to IDC now, IDC is making these numbers up, understand.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.160]   Nobody's knows what the actual numbers are.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:56.760]   So I don't know how accurate these are, but according to IDC in the second quarter of
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:04.520]   2015, 4.4 million Fitbits, 3.6 million Apple watches, a Xiaomi fitness band, 3.1 million,
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:10.760]   Garmin, 7 Samsung, 6, and others wins all 5.7 million.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:18.200]   So Apple only has, according to this, 3.6 out of the 18.1 million wearables sold.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   It's a small fraction.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.600]   It's a small market.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   I mean, this is a small-
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.200]   Well, it's not just a small market.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.560]   They have a small fraction of the small market.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.520]   This is not some breakaway hit.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:35.600]   And now I don't, by the way, it's not my job to decide whether to watch or a product
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.280]   of any kind of success based on sales.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.080]   I don't do that.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.360]   This is not a business show.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.440]   We're not judging Apple's business acumen.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.800]   I judge it on whether it's a success in terms of being a product that I and others might
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   want to use.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   And I think it's of limited utility.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   It's a little bit of a disappointment.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   That's fair.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   I totally agree.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   Good to see.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.440]   I mean, I wear mine every day.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.680]   And you know, someone on the subway or, you know, at a bar or a restaurant, asking me
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   what I think of it.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   And should I, they get one.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   And my answer is almost always no.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.800]   Do not get one.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   You have to know what it is.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.200]   And I think that, you know, kind of like we were saying earlier, it's best use is just
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   that.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   A watch.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.400]   I use it to check the time and notifications.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.400]   But that's sad.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   And that is it.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.160]   Steve, Steve, that's like the worst.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.200]   That's like what I think that the watch does worse.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   It's a terrible watch.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   It's a terrible watch.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.200]   That's a watch that doesn't even work most of the time.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.880]   It's a bad watch because it doesn't actually tell me the time I have to tap it or flick
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:37.000]   in order to see the time, which is relatively obvious.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.360]   At least Android where stays on.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.360]   Yes.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.360]   That's what I would love.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.800]   That's what I would love is to have it just a low, you know, battery mode where it's on
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.800]   all the time.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   I'm not.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.400]   I'm not really as negative on the watch as I sound.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.840]   I know I sound like I'm very negative on it.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.560]   But I mostly want to give a posing point of view that it isn't all that.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.640]   And I think a lot of people are like, this is, you know, this is Jesus watch.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:08.160]   And it isn't, it's still, wearables I think are very, very difficult.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.960]   Something that's small, it's difficult to come up with a user interface that's actually
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.320]   useful.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:18.480]   And so I think wearables in general, the Fitbit does very well for a lot less money at the
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.280]   kinds of things that people want fitness watches.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.200]   A TimeX would do very well at telling time.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.760]   The notifications is the one thing.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:31.000]   And I just, I feel like I don't really want those notifications coming in all the time.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.640]   I find that a little bit annoying.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.840]   But there are some use cases.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.680]   Walking around London was great to have a smart watch, say, turn left now, turn right
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.600]   now without having to stare at the map the whole time.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.320]   But I just feel like these are limited use cases.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:49.040]   Mostly I'm saying they haven't yet figured out how to make wearables really useful.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.000]   And I don't think that they will either.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.600]   I don't, I don't think that there's a whole lot more that this thing's going to do.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:59.720]   I think ultimately expectations are, were a little too high and Apple didn't necessarily
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.880]   help with that.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.320]   But it is good at those two things.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.800]   And I think it'll only get better, which are the notifications.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.240]   I don't like taking my phone out of my pocket all the time.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:12.320]   So to me, that's super useful to me.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:17.120]   And like I said, I liked notifications on Fitbit as well before this came out and did
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.600]   it a little better.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.160]   I used to Fitbit for a long time for fitness.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   And like I said, Fitbit does it well and still most of the other people in my family
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.640]   and friends still use Fitbit.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.960]   I've passed on my Fitbit to other people.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.920]   And so I think that it does those things a little bit better.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.520]   It is not, it's not a breakthrough product.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.720]   It is still 1.0, but it does do some things better.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.040]   And on that score, it does well.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.120]   It's not going to sell, I mean, I think we talked earlier in the year, people were talking
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:51.240]   about it's going to sell 20 million, 20 to 30 million units this year.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.120]   And I said, that's insane.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.680]   It will not sell more than five to 10.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   And that's about what the trajectory I think that they're on.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.960]   So it does those two things well.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.440]   If you want those, great.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:10.520]   So look for, it does need to do like Georgia was saying, it needs to stay on all the time.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.800]   So you can look at your watch.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.400]   I think the next version will probably have an OLED display, which is low power enough
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.920]   or has a low power enough mode that--
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.880]   Oh, this is an OLED display.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   Apple's using an OLED display.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.800]   I guess it's not OLED enough.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   It's not OLED.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.440]   And to be more OLED, I think Apple did a lot of great things with a watch.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.320]   I mean, they're good at design.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.400]   But I still don't think it's pretty.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.880]   I don't think it's only mildly useful.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.640]   And I guess what I'm saying is the same thing as you say, Steve, when you see people in
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:48.080]   the subway, which is unless you know you have a use for this and you know you want it, you
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.080]   probably shouldn't.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:54.160]   I've never-- I've been recommended any single person to actually go out and buy one, like
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.080]   a real person that's not in tech.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.360]   My hearing aid will tell me what time it is.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.760]   So a blind guy told me that he loves his Apple watch because it talks to him and tells him
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.160]   it's a talking watch, which I didn't know.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.280]   But it has the capability of speaking the time.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.080]   And he said, you know, that for that alone, this thing is great.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.080]   Huh.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.080]   So that's a great use.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.000]   I mean, for accessibility device, it's great.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.200]   It has all the accessibility settings built into it just like the Mac and the iPhone and
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   the iPad.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.680]   It can do anybody can use it.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.360]   It's really interesting that they were able to cram that in there.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.360]   All right.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.280]   So I'll give you a new word.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   Block a Palooza.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.280]   Ooh.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   Mm.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.040]   And it's about to happen next week.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.720]   Block a Palooza will happen September 9th.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:43.080]   I'll explain what this is all about and why it is absolutely a massive sea change in what's
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.440]   happening on the internet.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.400]   Is that a good tease?
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.400]   Wow.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   Wow.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.400]   Wow.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   Block a Palooza.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.400]   After the break.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   After the break.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.040]   But first-- thank you, Georgia Dow.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.480]   Oh, it reminds me.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.920]   Are you part of that incomparable team?
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.640]   I do a couple of shows with Jason.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   But I don't know if I-- I don't know what that means.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.640]   I don't know.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   He's asking me to record--
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.560]   He's asking me to record-- well, I want to be a part of that special handshake.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.920]   Whatever that is, that hat, whatever.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.880]   He's asking me to record a bit for the next incomparable theater.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:19.800]   Oh, wonderful.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.760]   So I'm going to be-- guess what?
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.120]   Guess what, I'll be the announcer.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.720]   You're not typecast at all.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.040]   I could be the creepy uncle.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.560]   Give me a chance.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:36.680]   Our show today-- see, I just get myself into these things, don't I, Georgia?
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.680]   You do.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.680]   Step in it.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.200]   It's my own fault.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:45.720]   Our show today brought to you by Citrix Go-To Meeting, a great way to meet with clients,
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:51.360]   colleagues, coworkers from the convenience of your smartphone, from your tablet, from
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.560]   your-- they don't have it from your watch yet.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.560]   But you know what?
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.640]   Don't put it past them.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.200]   These guys could easily do that.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.640]   Go to meeting.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.640]   It's the best way to meet.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.760]   When we have a meeting, we don't have a conference call.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.760]   We have a Go-To Meeting.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.920]   Now, you get all the conference call features, and you can use that, by the way, which is
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.920]   really cool.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.280]   If you have an iPad, you can use the speakers and the microphone on the iPad as the conference
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.360]   call, or you can use your regular phone.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.480]   The nice thing about doing it with Go-To Meeting is that if you need to share a screen, if
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:20.360]   you want to show your client, your PowerPoint presentation, your keynote presentation, you
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.760]   can do it.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:27.640]   Even better, you got a camera on that device on that iPad or that computer just turning
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   on.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.840]   Now, you're seeing them in HD quality.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.960]   It's practically like a face-to-face meeting.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.800]   You can share screens to present.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:38.320]   You can get feedback in real time, and you see each other.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.600]   I love Go-To Meeting.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.680]   This is truly empowering technology.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:45.320]   And I think it deserves the attention.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.400]   It's kind of taking the backseat.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.000]   We're all kind of used to this now.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.680]   But if you're not using it, do it right now.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.680]   You can sign up.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.680]   This takes a minute.

[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.960]   Go to meeting.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.480]   I'm Citrix.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.760]   You're watching "Twit" this week in tech.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.080]   Georgia Dow is here from iMore.com.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:21.240]   Jason Heiner from CBS Interactive from-- I want to say business insider, but I'm going
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.320]   to have to say the new one from techinsider.io.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.320]   Steve Novak.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.320]   That's exciting.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.280]   What is your job there?
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.000]   I am now a deputy editor.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.560]   So it's going to be crazy, but I oversee the tech section of tech insider.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.040]   There are four sections.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.040]   Nice.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.040]   Yeah, fun.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   Congratulations.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   Yeah, well done.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.040]   Yeah, good stuff.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.440]   Can we say one more thing about smartwatches?
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.440]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:54.120]   Okay, because Google, the next wave of Google Wear is about to happen.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.960]   Sorry, Android Wear devices is about to happen.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   Is it?
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:58.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:05.560]   Huawei is about to release their watch, which looks really sharp, by the way.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.280]   They were just showing it off to tech journalists not last week, but the week before in SF, in
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.640]   San Francisco.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.640]   That one looks sharp.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:20.400]   Also, the next Samsung gear is about to be released as well.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.040]   Is that Android Wear or is that Samsung's Tizen?
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.040]   Tizen.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.880]   Yes, that one is Tizen and not Android Wear.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.440]   Good point.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:32.160]   But they're going in the same direction.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.160]   It's similar.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.160]   It's similar.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:39.520]   Yeah, this Huawei has an Apple watch kind of feel to it, doesn't it?
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.640]   Oh, it looks really sharp.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:46.800]   It's got the Milanese loop.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.440]   The Samsung gear?
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.920]   The gear us too looks incredible from everything.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.480]   I mean, they've been posting pictures of it and Instagrams already.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.640]   It looks really, really good.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.440]   Jayce, you're saying it's going to work on iOS?
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:07.560]   So that's what's been reported is that it will work in iOS.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.480]   I should say rumored.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.840]   They have it on their product page on Amazon.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.840]   It says supports iOS and Android Wear.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.840]   No one knows what the next one is.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:22.280]   No, it's always going to be limited because Apple doesn't really let you be a peer to say
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.120]   the Apple watch.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.960]   Is this the gear that you're talking about?
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.200]   No, this is the old one.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.200]   I had this one.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.200]   This thing was horrible.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.200]   This was a nightmare.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.680]   The fact that I think sucked.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.680]   It's the gear S2.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.200]   That's sucked, then.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   That thing's sucked.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:40.200]   Super sharp.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.200]   There it is.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.200]   There's a story about it.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.200]   Techids are coming soon.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.200]   Berlin Thursday.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.200]   Oh, this is weak.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.200]   Yifa, right?
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.200]   Yup.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:58.600]   Yifa, you know, with Samsung making announcements outside of Yifa, Motorola, Microsoft, it feels
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.960]   like Yifa's less suddenly got less important, not more important.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.960]   I don't know.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.280]   It's not like the CES of, it's sort of like CES light of Europe, you know?
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.760]   So this is the gear two.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.040]   But everybody's moving away from these big trade shows anyway.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.360]   The gear two looks great.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.840]   I mean, what do these look better than?
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.200]   Is that an Apple watch?
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.200]   I just see it.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.200]   We're comparing it.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.200]   Oh, okay.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.800]   That was confusing for a moment because I thought, wow, Samsung's really ripping off Apple.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.680]   You're really copying now.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.680]   So it's round.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.680]   Right.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.760]   That top right image, if you go to the very top of the page, even more there, that's
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.360]   someone actually wearing it.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.360]   The I like round.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.200]   I think I was surprised a little bit that Apple did not go round.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.800]   Yeah, I think the ecosystem is moving toward round.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.760]   It's harder to do it, you know, from a developer perspective, right?
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.880]   Round is harder to a degree than square because so many of these apps and the existing ecosystem
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:56.440]   of all the things that are there are built for square, right?
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.600]   So round is a little harder.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.240]   But round does look nicer.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:05.600]   I mean, when I was testing Apple watch, I was testing the Moto 360 at the same time.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.160]   And I liked the look of the 360.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.160]   I just wish it was about a third smaller.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.000]   It was just kind of huge.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.520]   And you know, but I also got the smaller Apple watch to test as well, the 38 millimeter.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.760]   I find that it's fine.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.600]   But these round ones look really, really sharp.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.720]   I think the Huawei one, same thing, looks fantastic.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.960]   So maybe this category has some life in it.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.080]   And it's just we haven't seen the best yet.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.080]   I think that it's going to be the real world of the future.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.040]   I think that people are going to want to have technology with them that they don't have
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.200]   to actually take out of a pocket or purse.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.040]   It's going to be something that seamless and becomes part.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.720]   Similar to what you were saying with, you know, the hearing aids, it's something that
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.280]   makes it really easy because it's already a part of you.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.840]   So you don't have to find it there to give you information as you need and to help you
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.560]   be like that digital assistant throughout your day.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.880]   I think the trend is toward, to get what George is saying is the trend is toward, you
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.240]   know, technology becoming more invisible, right?
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.960]   Becoming, you know, integrating more seamlessly.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.520]   What do you do that?
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.240]   Each piece has to work with the other piece and U.I. is the problem.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.680]   And this is the problem I see with watches.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.200]   It's so small.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.760]   Look at what Apple's done with the stem and the button and the force touch.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.760]   There's too much U.I.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.920]   There's very hard to navigate.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.320]   Those icons are tiny.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.360]   I feel like if you're going to do that, then what you do is you take the computer and you
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.960]   break it out, but it all has to come back into a central hub, which is what the computer
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.360]   was for a long time in the home.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.800]   And I feel like a smartphone is actually perfect.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.840]   It's the perfect form factor.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.840]   We've solved the problems on this.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.480]   And it's not so far away.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.480]   It's on your body.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.680]   It's on your person.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:59.120]   And this can have a acceptable U.I. whereas a watcher, hearing aid or something stitched
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.600]   into your fabric can't.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.720]   Yeah, but if I'm taking a walk or I'm hiking or I'm at the gym or I'm doing anything active.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.280]   You guys are too active.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   That's part of the problem.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   I don't want to sit down.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.280]   I don't want to pull my phone out all the time.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280]   No, no.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.280]   You guys, relax.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.720]   You're doing too much crap outside of the house.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:22.640]   The problem with the phone is that it uses up either 100% or 50% of the phone.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.880]   You're using your usable limbs.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.360]   And so you're having to hold it.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.880]   So I have one phone that is being, one hand that I cannot use for something else.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.160]   And then if I'm going to interact with it, now I'm using both.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.640]   And so I can't do something else at the same time.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.240]   Don't do something else at the same time.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.240]   Stop it.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.720]   You're doing too much.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.440]   But that is our thing.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.440]   What do you mean?
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.440]   It uses...
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.440]   You want to do more for less.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.600]   50% of my usable limbs.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.400]   So what?
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.800]   What are you doing with the other ones?
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800]   Are you an acrobat?
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.400]   OK, you could be trying to catch one of your children that are running around.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.360]   You might be driving at the same time.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.280]   You don't use any technology while you're driving.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.360]   But you might be wanting to read the newspaper, being able to travel somewhere, or something
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360]   might have fallen down.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.360]   What?
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.840]   Do I choose between, do I drop my phone or do I drop the donuts?
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   Don't pick the donuts.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.840]   I did that once.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840]   I broke my phone.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840]   Really?
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.840]   It's a true story.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.840]   Absolutely true.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.400]   So take the donuts, leave the phone.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400]   My advice to you.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.560]   What about voice?
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.560]   Will that solve this?
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.720]   Because that is a UI that's getting better.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.840]   We just talked about it.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.840]   If I could talk to my stuff, the problem is you then look like a crazy person.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.680]   Yeah, you can only do that in certain contexts, right?
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.160]   You can't do that in every context.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.800]   I bought a second in Lexus.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800]   I'm sorry, echo.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.960]   I shouldn't say the A word.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.160]   I bought a second echo because I like being able to talk to my house.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.160]   And it's interesting.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.160]   It's not my house.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.160]   It's a tube.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.200]   But it feels like you're talking to your house.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:56.120]   And I think that what's cool about that is it's probably Siri and Google now can do more
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.080]   than Amazon.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.600]   But it feels like it's always there and you don't have to take anything out.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.320]   I'm lying in bed and I can say what time is it?
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.520]   I can say, read me my book, put me to bed, get me a hot cocoa.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.840]   No, I can't do that last stuff.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.080]   But that's not too far off.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.400]   Maybe voice is the way.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.880]   I don't know.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.240]   Yeah, no, it's a big part of the future.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.640]   But it has limited context because you can't be walking to downtown San Francisco.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.120]   But remember how crazy we thought people were when they talked into their Bluetooth headsets,
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.320]   walking down the street, animatedly, talking away.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.320]   We thought they were nuts.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.320]   Now we're used to it.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.320]   Still think they're nuts.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   Do you?
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.320]   I don't know.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320]   I still think they're nuts.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.120]   I still think it's not socially completely.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.120]   I just go.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.120]   I just go.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.960]   Push back and move on.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.120]   I'm noticing a tech, what is this?
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.120]   Techinsider.io.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.360]   You're talking about the Tesla.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.400]   Fresh car ever to get 103 points from consumer reports.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.040]   More than a perfect score.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.280]   It broke their system.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.440]   It broke their system.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.440]   It broke the system.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.440]   That was great.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.440]   Wow.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.440]   I watched that.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.440]   That was amazing.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.440]   Wow.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.440]   That is a safe car.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.440]   Safe car.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.440]   Still not getting one.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.840]   I don't want to go out anymore.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:14.840]   I want to stay home with my Amazon and my Echo and just talk and relax and have a good
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.840]   time.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.840]   You're not even on board with Apple watches.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.480]   No way you're getting a Tesla.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.320]   You kids in your electronics.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.080]   If you missed any of the fine programming that we had this week on Twitter, you might
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.760]   have missed something really entertaining.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.760]   Take a look.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.600]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.480]   You can jam this stylus back in and you can.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480]   It goes in.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.480]   This is backwards.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.600]   It sounds like you're doing a statement now which is a way to tell people that they should
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600]   read the manual.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.600]   Oh, I just did it.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.600]   Oh crap.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.000]   What's their official stance is RTFM.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.480]   iOS today.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.600]   Just came back from a long trip.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.440]   I did use the translation apps and they were great.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.880]   I'm wondering where I can find the art museum.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:03.800]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.800]   I do not know.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.800]   This week in Google.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800]   I wonder if we just drop it.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.800]   No, no, no, no.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.800]   You can just drop it.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800]   No, no, no.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.800]   Do it, Ron.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.800]   I'm straight up gravity.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800]   I'm getting stuck.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800]   See?
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.560]   You see how easy that went in?
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.720]   Tech news tonight.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.800]   I feel like all these notifications are making me much more productive.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.800]   What do you think?
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.040]   So notifications are very much the same as multitask.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.120]   If you multitask, you commit about twice as many errors as you would if you were focusing
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:33.560]   on a single task and it takes you 25% longer to complete all of those tasks.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.820]   This is your brain.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.360]   This is your brain on Twitter.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.360]   Any questions?
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.000]   Megan, but I can search the web if you like.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Thank you.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   It's so polite.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   It is helpful.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.440]   And I like it that you have a mail series.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.440]   I do.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.440]   Do you call him Sir?
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.440]   No, he calls me ma'am.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.680]   That's why I have the mail.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.760]   If you-- that's-- we're just beginning.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.760]   What's coming up this week?
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.280]   Mike, y'all gonna have the latest.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.480]   Coming up this week, Tuesday, September 1st is the beginning of the end for Flash on the
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.480]   Internet.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.800]   On that day, Google will disable Flash ads by default and Amazon will stop accepting
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.480]   all Flash ads on its main site, Amazon.com.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:12.800]   And on Thursday, September 3rd, Motorola will ship its MotoX Pure Edition, known as the
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.080]   MotoX Style outside the US.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.720]   The Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet ships Thursday as well.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.600]   And EFA, the giant consumer electronics and home appliance show, officially starts in
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.280]   Berlin on Friday, September 4th.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.120]   But a few companies are jumping the gun.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.960]   For example, both Sony and Asus will hold EFA-related events on Wednesday and will cover the Sony
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.360]   event live at 7 AM Pacific.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.000]   For all this and the rest of the news this week, tune into Tech News today at 10 AM Pacific
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.400]   1700 UTC at twit.tv/live.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.400]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.480]   Thank you, Mike Elgin, our News Director.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.720]   And I imagine Mike will be here next Wednesday.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720]   I'm gonna be out of town.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.680]   We're having a meetup in New York City on Wednesday, September 9th.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.240]   So I'm gonna miss the Apple event first time ever, I think, since 2001.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.840]   I've missed an Apple event.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:04.360]   But if you are in the Big Apple or near the Big Apple, come by Rattle and Hum, Mary Jofoli's
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.800]   favorite bar from three to five.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.000]   Have you been there Rattle and Hum?
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.440]   That's her spot.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.000]   Come by.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   Come by.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   Anybody's in New York.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.160]   Three to five PM Pacific Eastern will be there.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.360]   And so will Dick D. Bartolo, Mary Jofoli will be there and Paul Thorett from our Windows
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.360]   Weekly show.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.360]   I think others as well.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.680]   I'll be there, Lisa, my wife and our CEO will be there and we'll be glad to talk.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:33.640]   It's gonna be a lot of fun, half beer.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:39.920]   And then I think Apple's gonna make us order at midnight Pacific on Friday, right?
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.920]   If we want to get an iPhone.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.240]   Most likely if they follow their pattern.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.560]   So that means 3 AM New York time.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.560]   What do you East Coasters do?
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.240]   Do you just get up at three in the morning?
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.400]   You set your alarm.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.680]   Oh, God.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.920]   And then the alarm goes off and then you order all your Apple products and you go back to
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   bed.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:03.120]   I last time I did that last year and the alarm went off and I went back to sleep for 10 minutes.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120]   It's all.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.120]   And then I got online.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.120]   There was nothing.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.840]   Was that for the watch?
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.840]   No.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   Was it the watch yet?
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.840]   Was the watch?
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.080]   I think we talked about that one of the times I was on the show.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.080]   I fell asleep.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.080]   I fell back asleep.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.880]   Yeah, I didn't get up for three.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.720]   Because I thought you said I watched like isn't I gonna sell out?
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.720]   Oh boy.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.520]   I got up in the morning and I was like, oh, crap.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520]   I did.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   It sold out.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.960]   So I can I need a phone because as you know, I gave it.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.560]   Almost got my tech journal.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.320]   I think I might have got my tech journalist card nearly taken away for that.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.880]   You know, there you go.
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.880]   Pressure.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.080]   People don't understand what pressure we're under.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.080]   It's true.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.080]   Rough job.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.080]   Exactly right.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.880]   It's a rough job getting all of these people tech things and getting to talk about it online.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.880]   Tough job.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   It's rough.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   Hard.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880]   All right.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880]   I'm calling it block a Palooza.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.480]   I don't think this will catch on, but I'm calling it that.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.280]   And you guys know better than anybody because you work for web based publications.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.760]   We talked about this before.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.120]   Ad blocking is going through the roof.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.600]   Ad age said billions of dollars lost.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.920]   I don't know if that's hyperbole or if it's accurate, but I think it's really going to
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.920]   start snowballing.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:17.280]   And September 9 might be D day for online, not just online advertising, but online analytics
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.680]   of all kinds because iOS 9 will ship.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.000]   We presume.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.520]   And Apple is going to allow.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.320]   They've announced content blockers in Safari.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.760]   That means that many of the people who visit your site will not only not see your ads,
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.040]   you won't even see them.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.480]   You won't be able to count them.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.080]   Is that something that worries CBS interactive or business insider?
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.720]   It worries me and I don't even have, I don't even make money that way.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.800]   I feel like, I mean, of course, of course it worries me.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:52.480]   And I mean, obviously my livelihood is tied to people visiting the site and viewing ads.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.520]   And you know, I see it from a product standpoint.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.120]   Yes, they can slow down some sites.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.000]   By the way, business insiders very fast.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.440]   There's a study done comparing us to other sites and we load much faster than a lot of
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.440]   the competition.
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.320]   But anyway, you know, it's almost like stealing.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.000]   You know, I need to eat too.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.360]   I'm providing you a service.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.400]   I'm giving you great content.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   And if a little ad next to the content you're viewing bothers you, then go sort of then
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.400]   pay us.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.080]   There's an ethical, I agree.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   There's an ethical concern.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.080]   But let me ask you.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.760]   Let me ask you this, Steve.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.760]   Do you a Tivo TV shows?
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.760]   No, I'm a court cutter.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.760]   So you're a court cutter.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:31.760]   Okay.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.240]   But I pay for everything that I pay.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.240]   You do.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.240]   I have naps and ethical.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.240]   So you're ethical.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.240]   I'm totally ethical.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.240]   I don't want to.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:44.440]   See, I, okay, there are shows, network television shows that I watch that I go, I skip the commercials.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.560]   That's why I DVR them.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.200]   Is that am I, am I doing the same thing, aren't I?
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.840]   No, because they don't know that you're skipping the commercials.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.840]   Oh, good.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.840]   I'm off.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840]   See you fine.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:01.240]   Basically, morally, it is the same thing, which is, you know, you're consuming free content,
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.960]   ad supported content, but you're not, you're not supporting it.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.640]   You're trying to get your site.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.880]   Is stealing too harsh a word?
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880]   That's what Steve.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   Oh, no.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.880]   It's not.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.880]   What else is it?
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.880]   Part of the social contract.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.440]   It's part of the social contract.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:21.600]   If you walked in a store and took a candy bar and left without paying for it, that would
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.600]   be stealing.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.880]   If you go to a website, read the content without seeing the ads.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.360]   Is that the same?
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.760]   I think that there's a little bit of a difference in between this is that, so, you know, our
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.960]   mind works that things that are stagnant and stay in one place, eventually we start to
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   block out.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.960]   We don't actually see them.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.840]   We don't even, like, it doesn't even register in our mind because it's static and most static
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.560]   things were not anything dangerous.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.000]   So nothing that we actually need to pay attention to.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.400]   Most static things didn't kill us.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.400]   That's right.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.480]   Then after a while that they figured out that people aren't actually reading the advertising
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.560]   in this slide, we actually block them out from our mind as if they don't exist.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.880]   And so then they started changing them by making them really vivid colors.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.840]   So you can think about, like, animals that are vivid colors, they're a little more dangerous,
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.800]   so you should pay attention to them.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.880]   But after a while in time, people noticed, you know what?
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.720]   We're not looking at those ads either or increasing their clicking.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.520]   So then they started making the movement.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.960]   Our eyes are naturally made to take a look at movement because movement was dangerous to
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   us.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.960]   And the ads became more and more obnoxious.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.760]   And so I think that it was that they took advantage of the goodwill of wanting to go
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.200]   to sites, and now they've made these ads that are insensitized.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.720]   They chase you around the screen sometimes.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.720]   They blink.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.040]   They turn on audio without your choice.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.840]   And I think that they kind of broke the social contract, and that's why this is happening.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:48.680]   And I also, my site also needs people to come in, and, you know, there's advertising on
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.680]   that.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.160]   And I understand the other side of it as people saying, you know what?
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.720]   It's gotten to be too much.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.920]   And that increases our levels of stress, right?
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.640]   These ads are actually emotionally damaging to us.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   They cause us stress because things that chase us, things that we don't want to deal with.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:13.520]   It actually, it's like, well, that belly fat ad, that breaks my heart every time I see
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.520]   that ad.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.520]   No, but it increases our stress.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:18.960]   It's not something that we're, you know, going to have tears.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.960]   It's a little bit out of us each time.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.200]   It's death by a thousand cuts.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.200]   It's not all out of time.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.400]   It's inhibitory to us.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.880]   And so sites that run those types of ads, I won't go back to a site.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.800]   And I will even email and let them know because often, you know, some other ad company has
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   placed these ads there.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.080]   So a lot of websites you don't know, which advertising is happening on your site.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.080]   Isn't that though?
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.000]   Isn't that the right way to deal with it, the ethical way to deal with it is just not
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   go there again.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   Like, my God, you've invaded.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   Yes.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.400]   You've torn a little of my soul out.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.400]   I'm never coming back.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:56.760]   But you know, on the other hand, if you're in a quest for news or information, it's hard
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.040]   to remember which sites you're not allowed to visit anymore.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:04.080]   But I think that that's why though this has happened is that people are so annoyed with
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.720]   so many ads that are, you know, everywhere causing load times to be so slow that now
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.800]   people have taken to the other side and said, well, then no more.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.800]   I'm done now.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.000]   And the problem is, is that that's going to make it, we're going to be changing the entire
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.560]   way that we monetize web based forms is because people aren't going to be making money that
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.560]   way anymore.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.560]   Well, that's why I call this block of pop-ups because it's.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.560]   Yes.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.160]   Because no one's going to turn the back on after you've turned off ads.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.160]   Right.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.440]   As soon as you use an ad blocker once, you never go back.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.440]   I hate to tell.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:37.480]   If you're enjoying the content you're reading, if you want that to go away one day, then block
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.480]   all the ads because that will immediately vaporize so much great content out there.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:48.400]   The iMores, the business insiders, the C-Nets, all those sites, the Virgis, the Gizmodos.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.240]   I hear both sides.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.680]   I hear both sides though.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.640]   I also understand why people load times are tripled in some cases, not on business inside
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.240]   but on some sites.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:03.080]   Malware is injected via flash and other means on some sites.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.640]   We've seen this happen and over and over again.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.440]   The ads tear a little bit of your soul away each time.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.960]   So I understand why people block.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.200]   I really do.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:18.280]   I also think it's important for people to understand that that's how sites like Business
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:24.960]   Insider and iMore and Tech Republic, these are free to you.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.240]   They pay for the staff.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.640]   They pay for the servers.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.360]   They pay for the bandwidth with these ads.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:38.120]   I mean, but this is a game that is changing and is changing drastically.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:44.120]   We see the writing on the wall that advertising is a race to the bottom.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:50.960]   There's infinite demand, but infinite supply now.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.960]   There's so many sites writing about tech.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:18:01.720]   There's so many sites writing about business that they will do it and give people ads cheaper
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:06.640]   than what we do because our game is to play a quality game.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:14.080]   And so more and more, we're looking to other ways to monetize and we see that absolutely
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:17.840]   that's the future.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:24.280]   And when there's lots of conversations that we have all the time about how to make our
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:31.160]   pages load faster, how to not annoy people with ads, there's lots of talk when new kinds
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.360]   of ad units get put on the pages.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.640]   Then it's like, OK, then take some off, right?
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:43.920]   Because then that will enable the page to load faster that will not infringe on the users'
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.320]   time and their attention as much.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.760]   And those are the conversations you should be having when you're in the business that
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.880]   we're all in.
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:59.360]   And that's where, because if you don't and you overstep, that's when more people will
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:04.720]   use ad blockers because they'll feel like you sort of broke that unwritten rule of
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.560]   why I come here.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.400]   And I agree that I'm getting free content.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:15.120]   And so I have to see some ads or I have to do whatever.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:21.080]   But if you abuse that, that's kind of what George is getting at, if you abuse that, then
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.960]   the users take it upon themselves and say, you know what, I still want to come here,
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.000]   but I'm not going to keep doing this.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.520]   This is out of hand.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:33.480]   And so that's where as brands, we have to find ways to balance that.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:39.160]   It's like, you limit the number of ads that run on your show to a certain number and you
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.440]   won't take more than that, even if there's greater demand, even if you could make more
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:49.360]   money by running six ads or seven ads on your show, you limit it to three or four.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.280]   And so that's sort of the tenuous balance of this thing.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:58.040]   But I do think that all of us are faced with a future where we're going to have to think
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:03.920]   of other ways to monetize our sites because in a world of infinite supply where more
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:08.440]   and more people are doing tech, now mainstream media is trying to do a tech often very badly,
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:17.240]   but they will catch up and they'll hire more people, then that takes the value of all these
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.240]   ads down.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:22.280]   And so we start putting more on the pages and that's when ad blocking help.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.000]   That's where the vicious cycle comes and that's what we're in.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.280]   What is Apple's responsibility?
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:30.480]   I mean, they're turning this on and they're already three or four companies have announced
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:34.000]   they're going to do ad blockers for iOS.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   Why is Apple doing this?
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.400]   Is this just because, hey, we care about users?
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.760]   No, they're just trying to encourage people to apps.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.560]   It's not, I bet you anything, it's not going to block I ads.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.160]   They're trying to push everybody to apps, right?
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:53.520]   They want all of us to not encourage people to just use our mobile websites because in
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:56.680]   our apps, then we can serve ads, right?
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:02.040]   So they want us to create apps and get them more engaged in the app ecosystem and make
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:07.040]   really good apps on iOS and use those and not just use the mobile web because when it
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:11.200]   comes to the mobile web, who wins Google wins?
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:15.600]   When it comes to apps, who wins Apple wins because they take a cut of any revenue you
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:21.240]   have because they, you know, you're trying to make really good apps for one platform
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:26.240]   or the other, sometimes both, but if most people are developing for Apple first, they
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.760]   win when it's apps.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.400]   They lose when it's the web and so they're pushing.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.320]   That's what this whole thing is about and I don't think they should be doing it and it
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:40.800]   pisses me off that they are doing it, but that's what their game is.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:47.960]   I worry the other side effect of this is that when the less people look at ads, the more
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:53.760]   outrageous obnoxious ads have to be and then ads go underground with native content, ads
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:58.200]   that oppose is editorial but are in fact paid advertisement.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.880]   You're seeing a lot of sites do that.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.840]   Product placement, watch American Idol.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.800]   They have big Coke cups in front of them.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:09.960]   That's because people are skipping the ads in between.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.960]   And some of these...
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.760]   Well, I don't think that's so bad.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:17.640]   In fact, we keep trying to do product placement deals, but nobody will give me free pizza.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.640]   So I don't know why.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.640]   He's a cool wife.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   He's a great...
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:26.240]   Actually, we're talking about selling naming rights for the studio, which I think would
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.480]   be a nice unobtrusive way to do an ad.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:34.480]   But we have to be very careful because we have a sophisticated audience that's very
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.480]   privacy concerned.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.480]   Yes.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   It's very savvy.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.800]   I would assume that most of our users use ad blockers.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:46.480]   So it doesn't cost us much because we only have two banner ads, only one of which we
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.360]   charge for on our website.
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.440]   It does hurt us because we don't get analytics on the website, but yeah, that's not the end
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.440]   of the world.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.800]   That's not your distribution though.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:59.480]   Most of our money, 99.9% comes from ads in the podcasts.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.880]   And those have always been skippable.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.160]   I mean, a podcast just fast forward.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.920]   We teavote for you.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:05.920]   So those are the voice...
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.720]   The nice thing is that they have you saying something and people are already attached to
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.720]   you.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   And so it's something that's not unobtrusive.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.200]   It's something that's not exceptionally long.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.720]   There's not lights blinking out.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:20.240]   And so it's something that's comforting from someone that they've chosen to watch.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.960]   And so I think that that's...
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.440]   People feel comfortable to deal with that as they're contracted.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.440]   Okay, well, this is the advertising.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.080]   And I think that it increases the sellability of a product.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.760]   It's not just some square on a page and something like that.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:38.520]   No, in fact, if I were purely selfish, I would promote ad blocking because the worst ads
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:44.040]   work on tech, Republican, business, and cider and I'm more, the more my ads are valuable.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.040]   But I do...
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.560]   Yeah, but you're filtering it.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.840]   Your audience also trusts you that you're filtering it.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.840]   We do.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.000]   I turn down advertisers almost every day, I say no to somebody.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.760]   And by the way, that hurts people's.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:55.760]   Nobody ever...
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:58.200]   It's so funny because it's culture shock.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.360]   You don't want my money?
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.360]   No.
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.520]   Nobody's ever heard of turning down an ad.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.280]   That never happens.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.280]   And people are hurt.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.160]   Like, are you saying that my product sucks?
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.840]   I'm saying, no, I just don't think our audience is interested or we can't.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.040]   A lot of times is because we can't help you.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.040]   I don't think we're going to sell it.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.840]   That product will sell very well to our audience.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.240]   So I don't want to take your money.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.280]   I try to be ethical.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.560]   Maybe that's fine.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.560]   But I...
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.880]   It's also innovative though, right, Leo?
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.880]   Because that creates...
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:31.240]   That's what creates a trust with your audience is you are filtering essentially people who
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.600]   want to make a pitch to them.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600]   Yes.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:41.640]   And they trust you to do that because the stuff that has pitched, many of them have
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.640]   turned out well, right?
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.800]   I can think of at least three products that I learned about first on Twitch that I've
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.600]   ended up using, like Squarespace.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.760]   You know, it's so funny because Squarespace, I just was reading Lance Ulanoff's piece in
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.640]   Mashable about the quote, Renaissance of podcasting.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:03.320]   And he says Squarespace buys, I think he said, they said 100 or 200 different podcasts.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.160]   But they were the first one they bought.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.800]   How they got into podcasting.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.880]   You can't listen to a podcast without a Squarespace.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:12.880]   There's always a Squarespace.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.120]   I think that hurts us a little bit.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:19.480]   But anyway, whether ad blockers are good or bad, and by the way, we're going to spend
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:25.880]   a whole show on security now talking about a particular ad blocker called UBlock Origin
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.080]   that seems to be the ad blocker of choice these days from a security perspective as
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.000]   well as a privacy perspective as well as just pure convenience.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.640]   I don't want to promote ad blockers because I want...
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.200]   I want your sites to persist.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:43.960]   I don't want content, good free content to disappear.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.280]   I don't want paywalls everywhere I go.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.200]   I really hate it when I'm trying to read a Financial Times article.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.440]   And it says, sorry, you can't because you don't pay for Financial Times.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.520]   No, I wonder if the people in the chat and so forth are complaining about ads.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.800]   I mean, would they just start paying?
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.480]   If they love iMOR, if they love CNET, if they love this.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.480]   What about this Google contributor?
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.480]   Is that viable?
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:11.160]   If you have this contributor thing you pay Google, then they replace Google ads in the
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.520]   sites you visit and that some of that money goes to the website.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.520]   If you guys have been approached by contributing...
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.200]   Oh, I have no idea.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.680]   I mean, that's one way to kind of...
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.000]   Because what you don't want to do, I don't think anybody wants 500 little bills.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.040]   Micro payments, is that the solution?
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.040]   Micro payments will be part of it.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.200]   You know, a freemium essentially is part of it, right?
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:38.000]   There's going to be where there are layers of things you get for free and then to get
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.280]   greater value.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.360]   You know, that's where micro payments come in, right?
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:49.600]   So here's an interesting thing from Becky who's a regular in our chat room and a devoted
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.600]   fan.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.840]   And she says something, I think it's very interesting.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.360]   She's talking to you, Steve.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.840]   She said, it's not free content.
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.040]   I pay for my internet access.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.760]   Oh, yes.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.760]   Internet.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.320]   I hate that argument because that is the internet is...
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.640]   It's a pipe to this content.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   Yeah, that is...
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.520]   It's like saying I pay for a cable subscription, so I shouldn't have to pay for HBO.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.520]   Exactly.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:16.560]   Or like Netflix should be free because that's delivered over the internet or Hulu or anything
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:17.560]   you buy on iTunes.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.040]   All that should be free because you're paying 50 bucks a month.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.840]   But I think that that's explicit.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:26.280]   That's kind of how people are thinking, well, I spend a lot of money on the internet.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.280]   Yes.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:30.600]   That's a perception that's been there for 20 years, right?
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.720]   I've heard that argument.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:40.320]   And so I understand where it's coming from, but that again gets back to this idea of people
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:50.200]   not really understanding the social contract with advertising-based content.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:54.600]   And I don't think that that's going to change.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.920]   There are audiences that are more sophisticated, whatever, that can understand some of this
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:00.920]   stuff.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.280]   But that's not really the point.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:09.160]   The point is that we have to make a better case to our audiences to what we do and how
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:13.920]   we can provide them value and that how we need to get a certain amount of value back
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.760]   from them.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.480]   That's about telling our story, right?
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:22.800]   And that's something that you do, Leo, and that you have kind of innovated and have a
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.040]   way to do that.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.400]   Everybody else has to think that same way.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:31.400]   We're giving you this value and we expect this amount of value back or we get this much value
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:32.400]   out of you.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.440]   And so here's the value we give back.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.360]   Add Blockonado.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.360]   Add Blockapalooza.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:40.440]   Wait, what was the first one you said?
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440]   Blockapalooza.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.840]   Blockapalooza, yeah.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.960]   But that makes us feel like a party and a good thing and it's totally not.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.960]   That's just true.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:51.080]   I think we'll look back at September 9th as a kind of a turning point in this-
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.080]   Blockapalooops.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.080]   Blockapalooops.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:54.080]   Blockapalooops.
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.080]   Blockapalooops.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.080]   Add Blockapalooops.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.080]   Blockapopalooops.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.080]   Blockapalooops.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:01.120]   I don't even know if it's going to be that bad of a thing.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.800]   I think that it's going to cause people to have to change the manner in which we do advertising
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.480]   and I think it's also going to deal with how people don't really understand the manner
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.680]   in which websites really run.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.000]   But I think that it's going to change that.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.040]   I don't know if it has to be, though, bad.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:20.440]   I think that we can find better ways or have better contracts with people so that people
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:25.040]   feel comfortable in the sites that they go to and we can still fund them as well.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.520]   Well, it's going to be interesting to see what the side effects of this are.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.640]   I find it almost a little cynical that Apple's- they're not doing it.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.080]   They're opening up the door to it.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.960]   It almost feels like it's to their advantage that they're doing this.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.600]   Like, well, just look at the ads and the apps and not on so far.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:47.720]   You should just go to the app and then we'll help serve the ads.
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:54.160]   You can sell your ads there or if you can't sell ads there, then we'll sell ads for you.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.440]   I mean, that's the whole pitch.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:06.400]   And so, yeah, it's very hostile to content companies, which is not cool.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.520]   We'll see what happens.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.880]   George Dow is here from iMore.com.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.840]   Don't forget anxiety-videos.com.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:18.960]   If you or someone you know is suffering from anxiety, maybe it's a first step towards therapy.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.480]   Maybe it's an adjunct to the therapy you're already getting.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:25.680]   How do you feel about medication?
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:31.000]   I usually, unless someone is suicidal or they're really not able to live their life, I usually
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.720]   say let's try to do it without medication.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:35.200]   There's a lot of other things that you can do.
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.640]   But I'm completely neutral towards it.
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:41.640]   In the end, just live your life and there's some great medications out there that can
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:43.360]   make a huge difference to people.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:47.160]   And if you can't get out of bed and if you can't do any of the exercise or if you're
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.120]   having three or four panic attacks a day, great.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.360]   There's some fabulous medication.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:56.400]   It's not like your grandfather's medications that were out 20 or 20 years ago.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.320]   And so, I think that it could be a great help.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.480]   But usually I say let's try to do it without.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.480]   And then we'll see.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:06.400]   If things aren't moving along fast enough, then let's talk about some medications and
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.600]   then we'll monitor and see what they're at.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.280]   SSRIs are non-addictive, so you can go off with them.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:14.000]   It doesn't have to be able to stay on for life.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.840]   That's interesting.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:22.000]   Wait a minute, don't tell me, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   Wow, Leo.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000]   That's amazing.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000]   Very, very impressive.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   I don't know why.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   I have a strange memory for acronyms.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   That's brilliant.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.400]   It's not a wit in my career.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.400]   That's a lot of fun.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:37.200]   You might have went into the wrong career.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.640]   But what career is it that acronym?
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.640]   I always wanted to do it.
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:42.640]   It's a bit of a total.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:46.080]   I always thought I had a, I thought we'd always, I always wanted to do a game show on this
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.400]   network called acronym Olympics.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:51.160]   But it's so boring that we'll never do it.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.160]   Jason Hiner is-
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.160]   You're the only one that would-
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.160]   I would win every time.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.160]   Right.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.160]   Every time.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.160]   But you'd be alone.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.320]   You're one listener.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.320]   It's boring.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.960]   Jason Hiner is also here.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.520]   If I could have only converted that to something useful.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.920]   From a tech republic and CBS Interactive, you were just in the Bay Area.
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.080]   You didn't tell me.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.520]   Ah, so sorry.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.960]   I was at an event.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.960]   Intel IDF was that.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.560]   Oh, how was that?
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.560]   It was good.
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.560]   That looks cool.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.440]   The spider, who made that spider robot?
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.600]   The spider, yeah.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:26.520]   They're really, they've lost mobile and they know it.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.520]   And so they're putting all their-
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.400]   Intel has lost mobile.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.880]   Intel has lost mobile.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:32.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.920]   They're not even close, right?
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:40.600]   So they're looking at what's next, which is Internet of Things and Robots.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:44.920]   And they're really putting a lot of emphasis on both of those things and doing some interesting
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:48.560]   things, you know, in that regard.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:54.600]   Internet of Things, I think, is a risk because- or not a risk, but there's a risk that they
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.520]   won't succeed in that either.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:00.440]   Because the reasons they've lost in mobile, because their chips are too expensive and
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:08.000]   they use too much power, are not power efficient enough, are even more of an issue in IoT,
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.640]   in many cases, than they are in mobile.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:15.880]   Except for when you're dealing with sort of bigger things.
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:21.080]   But in robotics, which require massive amount of processing, right?
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:25.880]   They are doing some really interesting things beyond just processing, but in terms of, you
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:32.040]   know, building and sensing to devices, they have this real sense camera, which is essentially
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.280]   like Microsoft Connect.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:39.240]   But you imagine that in like every laptop and eventually in your phone and those kinds
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:46.440]   of things, basically 3D scanner, 3D camera, be able to do 3D gestures, that they're building
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.040]   into lots of different things.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:54.600]   And they're eventually, their idea is they want, you know, to that to be in robots as
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.600]   well.
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.600]   It's already in a few now.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.840]   But anyway, they're doing super cool things.
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.480]   So I really applaud them.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:05.840]   They're also spending a lot of effort on security, both for Internet of Things and in other
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:09.560]   ways, you know, to for PCs and other devices.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:15.280]   And so they say that that's the thing that they're hearing the most from technologists
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:19.920]   and from businesses and organizations, is they're really worried about security right
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.920]   now.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.840]   And so they're trying to build it in.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:26.200]   And they're in this way, they're becoming a bit of a software company, right?
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.400]   They're because they're having to do software for that.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:33.040]   So yeah, they're doing some smart stuff, which is beyond just sort of the chip that's going
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:37.320]   to power your next Windows PC, which is still the way most people think of them, but they're
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.080]   doing a lot more, which is very-
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.280]   They lost mobile than ARM one mobile, right?
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.320]   And the problem is, there's a lot of different companies.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.320]   It's called Comets, Samsung.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.200]   It's hundreds of different companies making ARM devices.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.520]   And then what happened to AMD?
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.520]   Are they around?
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:01.040]   I feel bad because I was rooting for AMD because if it weren't for AMD, I think AMD can
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.280]   tell on us, they could prices down.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.880]   If it weren't for AMD, we probably wouldn't have the core processors.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:07.880]   Intel-
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:10.680]   It's also a great company too.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:11.680]   I know.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.560]   Sorry, it's an easy company to root for.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:15.800]   It's one of the greenest companies in the world.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.920]   Like their headquarters is one of the greenest, the liens in the world.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:26.320]   And they also, some of the nicest people I've ever met in the tech industry were from AMD.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.040]   That's probably why they lost because Intel is kind of cut through.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:37.640]   And so just ruthless in many ways that they just ran over.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.280]   They just completely bulldozed them.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.440]   But yeah, they're still out there.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:42.880]   They're still doing some things.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.440]   But yeah, things are not super bright over there for them.
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.280]   They're trying to find their way in the kind of post-PC world still.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:57.480]   Also here from, I want to get the right website, techinsider.io, part of Business Insider.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.680]   So it wouldn't be wrong to say Business Insider.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.800]   Steve Kovecke, Steve Kovecke on the Twitter.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.280]   You still use the Twitter?
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:05.480]   Oh, constantly.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.480]   Are you read?
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.480]   Are you right?
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.480]   Are you both?
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.400]   I am a prolific tweeter.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.560]   Anyone who follows me will probably get annoyed.
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.760]   I did something very wrong and bad on Twitter.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.760]   What's that?
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.760]   I don't know if I should...
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.760]   I don't know if I should do that.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.760]   What did you do?
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:23.760]   I have to tell.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:24.760]   Now you have to tell us.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.760]   I got this.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:31.120]   I just like the giddy little smile you have.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.120]   It is bad.
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.920]   I got this dongle.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.920]   You never want to be in a sense that way, by the way.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:36.920]   I like what you're saying.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:37.920]   I don't know.
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:38.920]   Thanks.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:39.920]   I did something terribly wrong.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:40.920]   I got this dongle.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:41.920]   I got this dongle that goes on my card.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:43.760]   It's called an OBD, the onboard diagnostic port.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:47.200]   And it ties into software called Dash.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.400]   And Dash records everything.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.680]   And in fact, Dash yells at me if I accelerate too much or I jam on the brakes.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:55.440]   It actually says, "You're...
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.440]   Stop it."
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:01.520]   And then all of this with an eye towards better gas mileage.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.440]   But it also keeps track of all this stuff.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:09.160]   And then I turned out, I found out that if this than that has a Dash connector, so now
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.960]   I tweet when I arrive at the studio.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:16.800]   My car says, Leo turned off the ignition, that if this than that looks to see if I'm
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:20.600]   in the geographic area of the studio, and then it sends a tweet to Twitter saying, "Leo,
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.600]   just arrived at the studio."
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.840]   Well, I saw that.
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.480]   I saw you tweet that the other day.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.480]   Is that so bad?
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.480]   Is that bad?
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.480]   No.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.480]   Why is that bad?
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:34.280]   I feel like that might be useful because then people will know, "Well, Leo's here."
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.280]   I wondered what that was.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.480]   I saw you tweet that.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.160]   I was like, "What is he talking?"
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.440]   It was like a swarm check-in, but kind of not.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.040]   Like, I don't know what was going on.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:46.000]   I've always hated automated things, but I just thought that, "Well, that's kind of
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   useful."
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.040]   Did anyone tweet you back?
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.040]   Yeah, people hate it.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.040]   That's funny.
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:54.040]   I think I'm gonna have to turn it off.
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.520]   The reason I started playing with this is I've been starting to play with a messenger
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:58.520]   app called Telegram.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.520]   Have you tried Telegram?
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:00.520]   No.
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:01.520]   There's so many.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:09.480]   There's WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, Insta- There's millions of them.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.240]   Telegram, I kind of got into it.
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:12.240]   I like it.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.480]   It allows you to create bots.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:20.440]   I've created a bot called the Mechanical Leo.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:23.320]   If you want to, no, it's a Telegram.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.000]   I'm trying to do this on Twitter, but I can't.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000]   I do it on Telegram.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   You have to follow me.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.800]   You have to explicitly follow @chieftwitbot.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:37.640]   Then it will tell you when a new show comes out, when I'm about to begin a show, if I
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:43.160]   post a picture or a blog post it, and so on, if you follow this bot, it just tells you.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:46.080]   The last one looks like Leo is about to go live with this week in tech.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.200]   Now, where does it get this information from?
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.440]   It's from Twitter that it then sends out.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.440]   No.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:52.440]   No, it's all these sensors.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:55.360]   I eventually you'll know what I'm hearing.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:59.200]   If I'm here, Leo is deaf right now because he's turned off his hearing aids.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.480]   In 50 years when you're gone, Leo, this will be doing all this.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:03.480]   Exactly.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.600]   I wanted to continue after my death.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.560]   Anyway, I know it gets the information from a variety of sources, so there's a commercial
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.680]   version of this, if this than that, called Zapier.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.680]   You have to pay for it.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:18.680]   Yes.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:22.680]   So you have to pay for Zapier, but Zapier has all of these.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:23.680]   It's different from this.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.880]   It's similar to this than that.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.720]   You make recipes.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.000]   It works with Slack and stuff.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:36.560]   I have Zapier going out and look at things like if I post on pinboard, if I update, it's
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.280]   scanning through things.
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.480]   I want to do more with that.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.480]   Artificial intelligence.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:44.080]   This is basically like the beginnings of artificial intelligence.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:46.120]   I feel like it's super interesting.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:51.480]   One of the cool things, so if you have automatic, is that the thing that you have in your car?
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.920]   I do have automatic.
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:56.320]   Actually, this thing is Dash is the software.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.600]   It's free software.
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:02.520]   I use just a million of these commoditized OBD ports.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.240]   I'm using one called OBD MX.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.920]   They're 50 bucks or cheaper than automatic.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.160]   Automatic would do something similar.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.000]   But then I also, this is really, this is OCD.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:20.120]   In Evernote, I will post, so here's Leo's vehicle trip completed.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:21.360]   I will post complete.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.680]   This is really automatic.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:27.960]   Tells me how far I drove 2.2, 3.7062 miles.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:31.800]   How many engine light alerts, hard brake alerts, hard acceleration, speed alerts, SMS.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.480]   If you had a teenager, this would be useful.
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:38.600]   How much fuel it consumed, how much it cost is a quarter?
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.560]   What the weather was like?
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.040]   Remarkable.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:43.040]   That's in my Evernote.
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:44.040]   I find it creepy.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:52.680]   I want things to know less about me.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.480]   I'm trying to, I should be in technology.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:56.960]   You shouldn't be in technology.
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:00.920]   It's tracking information to me.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.760]   I don't want to be tweeted out.
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:07.400]   Georgia, I'm going to work with you.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:10.720]   This is called radical transparency.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:12.360]   It's the new thing.
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:14.320]   All the kids are doing it.
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.560]   It's immensely freeing.
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.520]   No, it is.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:24.080]   In fact, if everybody were radically transparent, there would be no television sitcoms.
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.760]   Follow my thinking here, because all sitcoms rely upon a misunderstanding that comes from
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:29.920]   miscommunication.
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:32.360]   All of them, every situation is-
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.880]   Well, he didn't tell you that he was actually outside.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:40.760]   If everybody's radically transparent, then it eliminates all this drama.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:44.680]   Yeah, it changes a little when you're a woman.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:48.120]   You probably don't want to be as radically transparent as to what you're doing, where
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.520]   you're going, how you feel.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.920]   So I think that I have a little bit of a different mindset to that because of that.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:53.920]   That's sad.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920]   That's a shame.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.160]   Information is power.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:01.120]   I think that people may have something that could be very dangerous in another part of
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:02.120]   the world.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:08.200]   You need to be careful that we're very lucky that we live in a free part of the world.
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.200]   Free-ish part.
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:10.200]   No, you're right.
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.200]   This is white male privilege.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.200]   Not everyone is.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.200]   Yeah, this is white male privilege speaking.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.800]   First world white male privilege.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.920]   I can be radically transparent because what's going to happen to me?
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:20.920]   Nothing.
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.840]   But something bad could, I guess, could- it's a shame.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:24.840]   That's too bad.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.280]   Because it is very freeing.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.080]   There are interesting- so there's people already there doing stuff like with automatic, and
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:39.640]   the combination of automatic and Internet of Things and sort of home automation where
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:43.800]   you can have automatic geo-fence just exactly what you're doing, Leo.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.000]   Like it senses when you're close to your house.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.920]   And if you have the Chamberlain garage door opener that's connected to Wi-Fi, you pull
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:57.800]   up and it automatically opens your garage door, for example, without you having to hit
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:58.800]   the button.
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.840]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:06.000]   And then not only that, if you have August, Smart Lock, it can unlock the door right to
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.240]   the inside of your garage automatically because you've geo-fenced and then you use if this
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.400]   is the net to do it.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:17.640]   And then it can also turn your lights on even when you get in automatically if you have
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.240]   smart lights.
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.200]   So there are people doing that right now.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.640]   But again, to Georgia's point, right?
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:34.440]   So if somebody gets your car, can they go and do exactly that?
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:35.440]   Well, yeah.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.440]   So, you know-
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.440]   It's easier.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.440]   Right?
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:39.440]   So many kids still break in.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.600]   Eliz in the chair says, "I can do this because I'm a high functioning sociopath."
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.520]   Let's just throw around diagnoses.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:48.520]   What do you say?
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:49.520]   Let's take a break.
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:51.640]   We're going to come back with more.
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:52.640]   I'm something.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.640]   I know I'm screwed up.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.640]   I am.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.480]   But I love it.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:57.480]   You know what happens?
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:58.920]   You guys are all young.
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:02.520]   As you get older, you start to care less and less, frankly.
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:03.520]   I think that that's healthy.
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:08.040]   I think that we often care too much about what other people think and want and do and
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:09.040]   we're not ourselves.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.040]   What is that?
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.080]   There's that old saying when you're young, you think everybody's looking at you.
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:17.920]   When you get to a certain age, you start to realize nobody's thinking about you.
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.320]   They're thinking about themselves.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.320]   They're all themselves.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.560]   He looks at, when you look at a group photo, who's the first person that you look at,
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:26.120]   that's what everyone's doing.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:31.320]   I showed you they brought to you by backup.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:36.080]   I mean, I would do an ad for backup no matter what because you people need to back up.
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.600]   I don't mean back up, back up your car.
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.800]   I mean, back up, back up your data, especially if you're business.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:45.000]   I can't believe how many businesses do not have a disaster plan.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.200]   The thing is, if you lose, let's say there's a fire at your business and the computers
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.640]   go, but so do the backup drives in the closet, they're gone too.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.680]   Now how long before you get back in business?
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.040]   You just lost your customer list, your accounts receivable, your suppliers, everything is
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.400]   gone.
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.920]   It's almost impossible to reconstruct that unless you have offsite backup and that's
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.280]   why I love carbonite.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:08.600]   Carbonite for business, it's a no-brainer.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.600]   First of all, it's very affordable.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.760]   Flat rate, you pay once a year or in fact you could do two years or three years.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:20.680]   You'll save a ton of money because you don't pay for how much you're storing.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.680]   You store it.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:26.160]   It's stored in the cloud where it's safe.
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:28.360]   The backups have backups.
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:32.200]   More than a million and a half homes and small businesses use carbonite.
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.080]   The thing about carbonite is it's simple.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:37.920]   I know a lot of you geek so well I'm going to rule my own within you'd arrive a Python
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:43.520]   script that writes to a Zamasons Glacier and you could do that or you could just install
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:45.680]   carbonite and forget it.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.040]   This is a great solution.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:50.920]   Carbonite.com, you'll get two free bonus months when you use our offer code TWIT.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.040]   You've got to back it up to get it back.
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.680]   This is not the time to geek out.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:57.520]   This is the time to protect your data.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:03.440]   Carbonite.com, you use your offer code TWIT and you'll get two months free.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:06.880]   Actually, that's one thing my, I don't know how accurate it is, but that's one thing my
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:08.560]   Samsung will do.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:11.040]   It has the S Health.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:17.960]   There's some sort of weird thing on the back that will read your heart rate, but then it
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:25.280]   also says it will read your blood oxygen level and your stress level.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:26.280]   I'm always stressed.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.280]   I'm never stressed.
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.280]   I never try it.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.920]   It says you're stressed.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.720]   I'm never not stressed.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.720]   Wow.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:35.720]   Now you have to place that onto your skin.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.520]   Yeah, you want to, I'll show you.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:39.520]   It's kind of cool.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.000]   Actually, let me take the back off.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000]   There's nothing to do with the watch.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.400]   I think you should just be a heart rate monitor.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.000]   I guess they added more stuff.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.960]   So it keeps tracking your steps.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:54.560]   There's my heart rate, my SP02, I don't know what that is, oxygen.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.560]   And here's stress.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.080]   So let's measure my stress.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.160]   Now you put your finger on the sensor here, right?
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.680]   It starts to shine a bright red light in there.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.080]   Whoa, except if you accidentally close it.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.200]   Okay, measuring.
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.400]   Try to keep still and quiet.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:09.400]   Shh.
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:12.400]   We'll scream at you to raise your stress level.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:15.960]   We'll see how between talk, how much he gets stressed when we speak.
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:20.480]   Oh, stress is going down.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.760]   Takes a long time to measure stress.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:23.000]   What is the definition of stress?
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000]   Well, I don't know.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000]   It doesn't tell you.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000]   It doesn't tell you.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.960]   How fast you're increased of your blood pressure.
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:34.560]   So when we're more stressed, we end up getting more adrenaline and cortisol in our system,
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:40.680]   which pumps out more blood to our main muscle group so we could get out of danger faster.
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:43.080]   So it's reading that.
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.360]   So our heart starts to be a little faster.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.120]   Our breathing goes a little bit quicker, but that's just to get out of danger.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.960]   And then it says, tell me how you're feeling.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:54.720]   I like a little emoji thing.
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.440]   It says a little emoji.
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:57.880]   I'm fearful.
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:02.320]   The green is low and see high as red and I'm really right on the edge of high, but I've
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.960]   never been any lower than that.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.600]   That's like Mike Arrington mode.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.000]   I'm always like a little.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000]   I'm fearful.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000]   You're fearful.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.560]   Is that what it says?
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:17.520]   It's really all right.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.840]   I am scared of women.
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:20.840]   You know that about me, Georgia.
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:21.840]   I am.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.600]   Aren't we all though?
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.600]   Really?
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:25.600]   Let's face it.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:29.360]   Did I say too much?
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.680]   Let's move on.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.560]   That was painful.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:36.600]   Amazon is getting rid of the fire phone, folks.
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:37.600]   You know what?
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.600]   That was a flop.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:39.600]   Oh, God.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:43.040]   That biggest one of the biggest flops ever.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:49.720]   And they say they're tailing development of consumer products like the fire phone, consumer
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:50.720]   devices.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.960]   At the same time, I feel like the Echo is a home run.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:58.000]   Echo's awesome.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.760]   Laios, this is the secretive lab 126.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.640]   It's hardware development center.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:06.400]   First Laios, you know, 11 years.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:11.760]   I think this is mostly, you know, I would think phone and tablet kind of group.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:12.760]   That has said that.
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:17.000]   And this is just pure conjecture, you know, on my part.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.160]   But that's my sense of it.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:23.840]   I think things like the Echo, things like the Fire TV, which are right on target, I think
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.040]   they'll continue to do more.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.280]   Apparently the Fire TV is way outselling the Apple TV.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.360]   It's doing really well.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.720]   Would not surprise me at all.
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:34.600]   I would see them doing more of that.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.160]   You know, tablet is a race to the bottom.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:38.760]   You know, phone is a race to the bottom.
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.240]   You read or they still kind of have a corner on that market.
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:42.240]   You know, it's not great.
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.240]   It's the best.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.240]   It's the best.
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:45.240]   Yep.
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:49.240]   Whatever happened to the COBO or the, I mean, they're all gone, aren't they?
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.240]   A toast.
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:51.240]   Tony, Tony, duck out of it.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.240]   Tony got out of it.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:53.240]   COBO is still around, I think.
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:56.800]   The B&N leader, you know, which wasn't bad.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.840]   But you know, that Squaresch one that they had, which was not a bad device, is a really
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.840]   pretty good device.
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:05.840]   Here's an interesting one.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:06.840]   I have a dash button.
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.200]   Anybody buy a dash button?
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.200]   No.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:10.200]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.200]   No.
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.240]   So this is, this is where Amazon is so brilliant.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:20.600]   I can see Jeff Bezos having a fever dream, waking up and saying, make a button.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:21.600]   You push it.
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.360]   It orders a product done profit.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.680]   So you buy, you don't, when you buy it, you buy it with a brand on it.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:32.960]   So I bought a cotton Nell toilet paper because I figure, well, there's one thing you'd want
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.680]   a button for it be toilet paper.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:39.360]   And when you run out, you press the button and it orders more toilet paper.
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.280]   Now, unfortunately, it's only second day delivery.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.960]   So you're going to be stuck on the job for a while.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:45.680]   But it's kind of cool.
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.680]   It's kind of cool.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:49.720]   But what I realized now is I don't need this button anymore because they've added it.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:55.800]   I can tell Echo, if I've bought something before it, and I can just say buy that again.
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:56.800]   And it will just do it.
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:57.800]   It won't.
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.200]   It just said, okay, fine.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:00.600]   This is where Amazon's brilliant.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:07.000]   This stuff is a, is a, is going to sell more product for Amazon than anything, right?
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.080]   For people with kids, would they, would they, if you press the button multiple times, is
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.080]   it going to send?
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:13.080]   Nope.
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:14.080]   They thought of that.
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:16.080]   Nope.
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.080]   They thought of that.
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.080]   It's debounced.
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.600]   So the first, you press the button and it orders it until the stuff comes.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:20.600]   You can't order it again.
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:21.600]   That's fair.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:26.440]   Remember they announced this on April 1st and everybody thought it was a joke.
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:28.440]   I mean, it really is.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.440]   So did I.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:32.440]   I think it's still a joke, but you know, you said it.
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.440]   No, it works.
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:34.440]   I tried it.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.440]   I installed it.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.440]   I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:39.440]   I didn't, I didn't.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:40.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:41.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:47.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:49.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:52.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:53.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:54.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:55.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:57.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:51:59.440]   I didn't.
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:00.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:01.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:03.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:06.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:07.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:08.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:09.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:10.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:11.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:12.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:13.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:14.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:15.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:16.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:17.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:18.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:19.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:21.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:22.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:23.440]   I didn't.
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:24.440]   I didn't.

[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:13.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:18.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:21.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:22.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:24.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:26.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:27.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:28.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:29.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:31.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:33.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:34.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:35.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:36.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:37.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:38.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:39.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:40.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:41.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:42.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:43.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:44.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:46.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:47.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:49.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:51.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:54.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:55.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:56.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:58.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:59.440]   I didn't.
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:00.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:01.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:02.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:04.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:05.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:06.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:09.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:12.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:14.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:15.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:17.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:18.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:19.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:21.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:22.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:24.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:26.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:29.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:31.440]   I didn't.
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:32.440]   I didn't wake it up.
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.440]   That's like literally right over there.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.440]   Man, you know, just punk like you're a whole audience.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.440]   Okay.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.440]   Moving on.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:45.440]   Speaking of exit eye, is that the plural of exit is?
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.440]   You got someone in the chat room, by the way.
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.440]   I know.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.440]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:50.440]   Oh, I know.
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.440]   You think I'm joking.
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:55.440]   A little worrisome.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:57.440]   Google now folks are leaving.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.440]   Now I think Google now is awesome.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:02.440]   But apparently that was more of a Larry Page thing.
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:05.440]   Send her a child less of a Google now guy.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:11.800]   Turns out that even during Google I/O when they were announcing now on tap, people had
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:12.800]   already left.
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:15.440]   I think only one of the original team is still there.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.440]   Should I worry Steve?
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.440]   Is that the other?
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:20.440]   Is this going to be over or is this?
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:21.440]   No, I don't know if it's real.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.440]   I don't know if it's real.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:23.440]   I don't know if it's real.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:24.440]   I don't know if it's real.
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:25.440]   I don't know if it's real.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.440]   I don't know if it's real.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:33.200]   It's bad because of Facebook just announced their M assistant, which is powered by real
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.440]   people and so forth.
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.680]   But Google now it's baked in Android.
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:40.480]   It's an awesome product.
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:42.680]   It's more searched than anything anyway.
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:43.680]   Right?
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:46.000]   So I don't think it's going to go away.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.520]   Now on tap is awesome.
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.920]   This is maybe Sundar is shuffling things around or something.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:56.200]   But I mean, that thing is such a home run.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.200]   It was light years ahead of Siri when they first announced it.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:01.760]   I still think it's better than Siri.
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.080]   The timing is bad because Facebook is getting into the space and we just talked about Amazon
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.720]   and Alexa and so forth.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:11.960]   But I think we don't have to worry about it if you love Google now.
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:13.800]   Let's talk about this Facebook thing.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.520]   This was rumored it was going to be called MoneyPenny.
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:20.160]   They decided to call it M. It's tied into Messenger, right?
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.160]   So--
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:23.160]   It's neat.
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:25.160]   They have all these contractors who will do anything for you.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:27.160]   It's pretty early testing.
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.160]   So they won't say how many they have.
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.160]   But it's in the Bay Area only for now.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:32.640]   So I guess you can try it if you want to.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:33.640]   No, no, I tried.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:34.640]   It's San Francisco.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:35.640]   I'm too far nor--
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.640]   But actually Justin San Francisco.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:39.920]   And there are other services like this.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:43.720]   I think PATH had something similar to it maybe.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:44.880]   And there are a few others.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.720]   Like these services were you taxed.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:51.520]   And this human being will do everything you want for you for free, which I don't know
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:52.720]   how you make money on that.
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:54.720]   But it doesn't matter.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:55.720]   Who was it?
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:58.840]   I think it was Chris Messina, the father of the hashtag.
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:02.440]   Which by the way, just celebrated the-- I think the 10th-- was it the 10th or the 10th?
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.560]   No, it couldn't be the 10th, the fifth anniversary of the hashtag.
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:10.720]   He tweeted, why don't we use, I don't know, a number sign plus a word to have a Twitter
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:12.000]   search and that became.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.720]   So anyway, Chris is a great guy.
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:17.800]   He had signed up for some maid service.
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:18.800]   Does the same thing.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.520]   You text them and they come.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:21.520]   And he couldn't cancel.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:27.480]   So then he went to a sign up for another personal assistance service and texted them to cancel
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:28.480]   the maid service.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:29.480]   And it worked.
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:30.480]   Wow.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.480]   Wow.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.480]   The world really didn't.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.480]   Wow.
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:37.760]   Buttons, virtual paper and assistance, taking care of other assistance.
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:38.760]   It's yeah.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:39.760]   Man.
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:41.400]   What a world.
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:45.120]   I think this is-- would you use something like this, Georgia?
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.720]   If you could message a personal assistant, sure you would.
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:49.880]   This actually interests me.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:55.080]   I'm not a Facebook user, but I love the idea of trying to find a gift for a friend.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:58.720]   And an actual person is going to personalize it and be able to tell me what would be the
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:01.160]   best thing to do because that would save me time.
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:02.520]   And I don't have a lot of it.
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.520]   Right.
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.520]   So I'm intrigued.
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:08.240]   Or restaurant reservation where you're going to be on the phone forever.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:09.240]   That sounds fabulous.
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.760]   Just could you hold on for me while I go do something else?
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:13.760]   Exactly.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:17.000]   I would love if they would wait in line at the bank as well, but I'll wait for that.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.200]   It is sort of interesting, right?
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:22.760]   It's kind of like the idea of like, can technology be more helpful?
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.920]   Can it create like more meaningful connections between people?
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.000]   Because that's not only what this is trying to do, right?
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.880]   It's to connect you with someone that can help you in a meaningful way.
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:34.840]   There's AI in it, but the AI is only used to the extent that it contacts a human.
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:37.840]   So that's good.
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:38.840]   Like that makes sense.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:42.120]   So I like that Facebook's trying to do something different, right?
[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:48.240]   That they're trying to take advantage of what they have, which is a huge network of people.
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:53.200]   And it is a more sort of people oriented service.
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:55.120]   So I think it is.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:56.120]   It's intriguing.
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:59.840]   And it's interesting to see them doing something different, not trying to do the same kinds
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:07.160]   of things with the stuff that Apple and Amazon and Google are already doing and are already
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:12.240]   pretty good at and are slugging it out right now.
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:13.240]   Let's take a break.
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:16.960]   We'll come back some final words that I'm going to ask you if you know what Netflix
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:18.960]   and chill means.
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:21.000]   Oh, somebody does.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.240]   Oh, I know.
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:24.240]   Oh, I know.
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:25.800]   Do you know Georgia?
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:28.360]   I might know.
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:32.640]   I just found out.
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:37.280]   Our show today brought to you by Prosper a really brilliant way to solve a kind of a
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:38.280]   conundrum.
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:44.560]   If you need some cash to fix up your house or to maybe pay off some high interest credit
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:46.840]   cards, you don't have a whole lot of choices.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:49.240]   If you want, I guess you could go to a family member.
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.400]   That's sticky.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.400]   That's messy.
[01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:53.640]   You could go to a loan shark.
[01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:55.240]   No.
[01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:59.720]   You could put pants on, put on the necktie, nice hat, and go to the bank and say, "Please
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:01.160]   say I may have some money."
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:02.800]   None of these are the best way to do it.
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.280]   Thanks to the internet, there's a better way.
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:06.280]   Prosper.
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:09.360]   Prosper is something that they couldn't exist without the internet.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:12.760]   It's what they call a peer to peer lending marketplace.
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:16.040]   So it's a marketplace for people who have money to lend, brings them together with
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:18.160]   people who are looking to borrow money.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:20.840]   It works great.
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:23.240]   It's amazing.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:28.520]   If you can borrow up to $35,000, take you as little as five days, these are low fixed
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:29.520]   rate interest.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:33.600]   You can go right now to prosper.com/twit and find out what your rate would be.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:40.680]   Without affecting your good credit, prosperprospere.com/twit.
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.840]   Don't rack up more debt on those high rate credit cards.
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:46.880]   If there's one thing you would do right away, do it pay it off with prosper, get a low fixed
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:47.880]   rate payment.
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:50.000]   You'll know exactly what you pay every month.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.840]   You can get out from under.
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:56.320]   There's so many great reasons you might want to borrow as much as $35,000 in just a few
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.320]   days.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:58.320]   This is the way to do it.
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:00:59.320]   Prosper.com.
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:04.600]   For a limited time, Prosper is offering Twit viewers a $50 Visa gift card with your low interest
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.600]   loan.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:11.360]   You can get up to $35,000 in your account in as few as five days plus a $50 Visa gift card
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:17.560]   at prosper.com/twit.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:23.400]   Speaking of layoffs, Angry Birds, folks, Rovio cutting another 260 people.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:27.000]   What did they have 800 employees for?
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000]   They had 800 employees.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:33.920]   I mean, I don't mean to laugh, but this is, you have one hit, Angry Birds.
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:40.120]   Rovio, which was huge, they laid off 110 employees last October and another 260 jobs
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:43.960]   down from 800.
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:44.960]   Kind of sad.
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:45.960]   Yeah.
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:50.120]   Just shows how hard though it is to come up with a second one, isn't it?
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:51.280]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:55.120]   I mean, anything in life is kind of like that.
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:02:00.240]   You have a huge hit and it's tough to replicate, right?
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:02.080]   And anything.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:06.680]   I remember somebody we all know, Ryan Block.
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:07.680]   I remember when he was last.
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:08.680]   I remember him.
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:09.680]   Ryan Block.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:15.280]   I remember when he left because, or not because Moto, Engaged It.
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.960]   And he said something really wise, especially I think he must have been late 20s at the
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:20.960]   time.
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:23.160]   He was like, look, this has been amazing.
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:25.520]   I had a great time doing this.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:31.400]   And I fully realized that I may never do anything that's this successful again, but there's
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:32.960]   a lot of other things I'd like to try.
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:36.120]   And there's a lot of other things I'd like to spend my time doing.
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:38.520]   And I'm going to go and do those.
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:41.200]   And I thought that that was really wise.
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:43.440]   And most people don't think that way.
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.560]   Most people think like, I'm on top of the world.
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:48.000]   I'm doing something that's just on fire.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.800]   And the next thing I do is absolutely going to be just as amazing.
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:56.240]   Isn't that the worst thing you can do is be a great success in your 20s.
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:57.240]   Right?
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:02:58.240]   It's tough, right?
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:00.280]   Because you all know what that's like.
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:02.080]   You ever replicate it?
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.080]   Yeah.
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:08.640]   Georgia, you deal with people who suffer from early success.
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:09.640]   You know, I was reading.
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:10.640]   Did you read?
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:11.640]   I felt so bad.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:12.640]   I'm sorry.
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:13.640]   I mean, you're up to it.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:15.320]   Marcus person, the guy who invented Minecraft.
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:16.320]   Yes.
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.320]   Yes.
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.280]   I mean, this guy sold Minecraft for how much to Microsoft billions.
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:22.440]   He made billions.
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:23.440]   So much.
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.440]   A couple billion.
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:25.440]   Yeah.
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:26.440]   And he kept a lot of it.
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.360]   I mean, he was, he had, I think, close to half the company.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:29.360]   Yeah.
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:33.640]   And this week, like how depressed he is, how lonely he is, how sad he is.
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:34.640]   Yeah.
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:35.720]   It's a horrible thing.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:38.920]   It doesn't even have to be that you're doing this when you're young at life.
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:43.040]   I think that any time that you feel like you're on top of the world, you get a lot of accolades.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:48.160]   You get a lot of outside feelings of self-esteem and self-worth and that releases in your
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:52.480]   brain the natural reward hormone neurotransmitter, which is dopamine.
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.720]   And then when you go back to being, you know, normal and people aren't following you and
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.920]   wanting to hear everything that you do, you cause a decrease in the amount of dopamine,
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:03.320]   which can bring on a depression.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:08.120]   And a lot of people that are actors, actresses, like, you know, dealing with doing great, wonderful
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:11.560]   things and everyone knows who you are, it's a huge drop.
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:16.120]   And so you need to also remember to kind of build that internal modes of self-esteem
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:17.720]   because it's devastating to people.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:18.720]   Yes.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:23.240]   It's quite a situational depression, which is much easier to deal with in that you know
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:27.160]   that it's caused because of something.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:29.840]   But it's still just as emotionally devastating.
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:30.840]   Listen to this.
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:36.640]   This is not, this is not, yes, yesterday, 2.50 in the morning, hanging out in a betha with
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:40.760]   a bunch of friends and partying with famous people, able to do whatever I want.
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:43.600]   And I've never felt more isolated.
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:47.320]   The problem with getting everything is you run out of reasons to keep trying and human
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:50.280]   interaction becomes impossible due to imbalance.
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.800]   People really reached, this is interesting that he tweeted this.
[02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:55.360]   I mean, that's a very public.
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.240]   It's not, is kind of a cry for help.
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:58.240]   I don't know.
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:59.240]   Yes, it is.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:00.240]   It definitely is.
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:03.600]   He says in Sweden, I'll sit around and this is all within a few minutes.
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:07.280]   I will sit around and wait for my friends with jobs and families to have time to do stuff,
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:11.040]   watching my reflection in the monitor.
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:15.000]   Found a great girl, but she's afraid of me and my lifestyle and went with a normal person
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000]   instead.
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.800]   Then the next day though, he tweeted something like, I'm having a great time.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:26.640]   But a lot of people, I think were touched by that, wanted to reach out.
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:34.680]   So many people were influenced by Minecraft and on or notch for his successes, but just
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:36.640]   shows you.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:39.160]   You can be this vast success.
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:40.160]   Yes.
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:45.280]   And people, I don't think that people really know the cost of being successful or how it
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:46.280]   excludes you.
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:50.920]   You become not the same as everyone else and how people treat you as different and then
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:54.320]   you don't know who's really your friend versus people that want to be a friend just
[02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:56.440]   because you were the success.
[02:05:56.440 --> 02:06:02.560]   And so it also causes that disjoint in social interactions, which can be very difficult.
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:04.160]   And attention is a drug, right?
[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:11.280]   Like it's a natural drug like George is saying and you get used to that and you like it and
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:19.840]   you depend on that and when you don't have it, then it becomes painful and isolated and
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:20.840]   lonely.
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:22.400]   It actually becomes normal.
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:23.400]   Like right?
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:27.320]   If you've received tons of accolades all the time, that becomes your normal base level
[02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:28.320]   of normality.
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:29.520]   So it's not even a high.
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:31.640]   That's just normally how you feel good.
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:35.880]   And then that's why you end up with that decrease because your body has adapted to having
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:39.840]   that much dopamine in its system being released because of things.
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:43.360]   And so it can happen in many different, I remember when I first started therapy, I would
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:46.520]   get all these highs from helping people and on the weekends, I felt a little bit down and
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:50.760]   low because I was not helping people like I was before.
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:52.280]   And so I had to think, oh, what's happening?
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:56.320]   And then I'm like, oh, okay, I understand what the process is, which made it a little
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.680]   bit better to you easier to deal with.
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:02.200]   One of the reasons we can identify with this too is because I think we can identify with
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:03.560]   Notch.
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:09.120]   Like he was just, he was a nerd like us or like me anyway.
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:14.480]   And he wrote this great program and it's kind of lightning in a bottle, made a billion
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:15.480]   dollars.
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:19.320]   And he doesn't have any more skills to deal with it than anybody would.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.320]   He's a nerd.
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:21.640]   He probably has fewer because he's an introvert.
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:23.680]   I'm sure he's an introvert.
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:30.360]   And anyway, Notch, I hope you're getting some love and some help and stay safe.
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:31.360]   Yes.
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.560]   I think we should wrap it up.
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:38.000]   I know it's kind of a sad note, but I think we've done a great, we've done our job here.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.000]   We can move on.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:45.360]   It's happy in the knowledge that we've helped so many people in their daily lives.
[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:48.440]   And Steve Kovac is tweeting like a mad man.
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:49.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:50.440]   Always.
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:52.720]   You do tweet a lot.
[02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:53.720]   Holy cow.
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:56.400]   How many tweets during the show?
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:57.400]   Yeah.
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:07:58.400]   In the show?
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:07:59.400]   No, only two.
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:00.400]   Not that many.
[02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:01.400]   Just a couple.
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:02.400]   Yeah.
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:04.240]   I thought we were going to talk about Netflix and chill.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:06.080]   So I tweeted, I teased that a little bit.
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:07.080]   Oh, well, we can.
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:08.080]   What is it?
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:14.640]   So I had never heard that phrase before, although as soon as as I heard it, I got it.
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:15.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:16.640]   Because it's what the kids.
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:17.640]   It's a modern day.
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:18.640]   Yeah.
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:19.640]   What was what?
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:21.200]   We want to watch a movie that we did in college.
[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:23.080]   It's like come to my dorm room and watch a movie.
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:25.640]   It was blockbuster on chill, right?
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:30.840]   No, we're just like, let me put a DVD in and we'll watch Kill Bill or something for five
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:32.640]   minutes and then start making out.
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:33.640]   Yeah.
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:41.720]   In fact, there's a great Buzzfeed series of pictures from Buzzfeed kind of putting this
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:42.720]   in perspective.
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:46.960]   You said Netflix and chill the cat all over the the hamster.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:53.840]   Can you imagine all these like poor clueless teenagers that are saying this by accident
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:55.080]   and not realizing it?
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:56.080]   Yeah.
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.080]   Here's a good one.
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:01.240]   Twenty minutes in the Lord of the Rings and chill and he gives me this look.
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:03.040]   I love it.
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:06.280]   It's like the Tinder of Internet euphemisms now.
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:07.280]   Here it is.
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:14.720]   blockbuster and kick it.
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:24.160]   Anyway now you know when you're on a budget but still trying to get down YouTube and chill.
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:27.120]   You know, I think that actually works.
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:31.280]   When he start kissing the neck before Netflix even load.
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:32.280]   Okay.
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:36.680]   We'll move on.
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:40.360]   Thank you.
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:46.000]   See in my day it was nest quick and chill.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.080]   Georgia you had no idea what that meant.
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:51.400]   I didn't until I read the no.
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:53.360]   I think Anthony knew though.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:57.880]   I think that for women it's just kind of like if a guy's asking you over to his place.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:58.880]   You know.
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:03.080]   You're kind of like, I don't really matter what he says after that.
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:07.760]   You're kind of like, you're like, uh huh.
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:10.200]   It's so different for women.
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.840]   It is completely different men.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:18.720]   Men were we still expect guys to do most of the work to try to get a female and females
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:20.520]   don't have the same amount of work.
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:23.200]   We'll just look at the Ashley Madison stats, right?
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:29.000]   It was like 20 million men and a thousand four hundred girls that were real girls.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000]   That's a really.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000]   That's a really.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000]   What's up with that?
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.920]   It is much easier for women to find a relationship which is really, you know, difficult.
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:41.040]   It's really difficult to get out there.
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:45.160]   And now, you know, we're becoming more introverted with technology, not better at it.
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:47.920]   Unfortunately, it's like Saturday night at the bars.
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:51.000]   Twelve million men and four thousand girls.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000]   Yeah.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000]   Yeah.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.440]   Georgia Dow, you are at i'more.com doing great work.
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:03.440]   Stay away from her guys.
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:04.800]   She can take your ass two time champion in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Canadian champion.
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:05.800]   Okay.
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:09.200]   Is that why you learned that?
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.200]   I just wanted to become a super hero.
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:12.520]   Oh, I couldn't do that.
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:13.880]   She's a wonder woman.
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:15.360]   She doesn't even need bracelets.
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:16.360]   She just does.
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:17.920]   You're awesome.
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:19.160]   You are awesome.
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:24.960]   And again, the website, which I, in all seriousness, I think this is great to promote it.
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:25.960]   Thank you.
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:26.960]   So, you can get help.
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:31.960]   It doesn't have to be these videos, whichever way it might be.
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:32.960]   Good on you.
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:34.960]   Appreciate you're doing that.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:44.480]   Jason Heiner, he's at CBS Interactive.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:48.280]   His book is now up to chapter, what, seven, eight?
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:49.280]   Chapter eight.
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:51.080]   So, chapter seven is Chase Jarvis.
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.080]   Yes.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.880]   Available for 48, about 48 more hours.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:57.400]   You can still read for free online.
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:59.600]   We release every chapter online for free.
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:00.600]   Serial publishing.
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:01.600]   Yeah.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:06.880]   And then the next chapter we just announced today that will be released this week on
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:16.760]   Wednesday is actually Juliana Rotich, who is the co-founder and executive director of
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:22.920]   Usha HeeDee, which is the amazing company that has created.
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:27.080]   They created in 2008 this mapping software, which sounds simple enough, right?
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:31.960]   But it was in following the presidential elections and Kenya disputed presidential elections,
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:38.280]   they cut off communication and people couldn't figure out what was going on.
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:45.120]   The software let people, from their phones, be able to essentially do citizen journalism,
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:49.080]   to report incidents, to report things that were happening on the ground.
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:55.880]   And so it gave the citizens of the country an idea of where places to avoid, where they
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:59.520]   could go to get resources and help, if they need it.
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:02.560]   And from there, it's taken off like wildfire.
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:05.800]   Now Usha HeeDee is used all over the world.
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:10.000]   And it's not just with SMS, it's also now it's web SMS.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.160]   It's used with apps.
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:13.360]   It's used with Twitter.
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:17.240]   Twitter has a special relationship with them.
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:20.160]   In places of crisis, they can use this software.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:21.160]   People can tweet stuff.
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:23.560]   And then that gets triangulated on this tweet map.
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:26.760]   So anyway, Julianne is a really amazing person.
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:30.400]   She also does all kinds of other technology products.
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:32.720]   She started as a computer scientist.
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:40.080]   And now she runs Usha HeeDee and is also globally in demand speaker, one of the most
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:42.360]   in demand speakers in the tech world.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:47.200]   She had a TED talk last year about this other thing that they do, BRIC, which is a little
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:54.200]   modem and power generator for remote areas so that you don't lose your internet connection.
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:59.120]   She did a TED talk about that that got over half a million views and has translated into
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:00.320]   30 languages.
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:03.080]   So she's really amazing.
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:06.480]   She's one of the people that a lot of people maybe don't know a lot about.
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:10.720]   She doesn't necessarily toot her own horn, but she's one of the people that we feel like
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:14.400]   is one of the most important digital innovators in the world.
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:17.600]   And so we can't wait to share her story this week.
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:19.160]   Nice.
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:21.520]   Follow thegeeksbook.com.
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:25.360]   Two more days you can read about Chase Jarvis, which you should do.
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:29.280]   There have been so many great people in all of these chapters.
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.240]   Many people you know if you're a Twitter follower, Baratunde Thurston.
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:36.240]   By the way, Baratunde just got a job with the Daily Show.
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.240]   The Daily Show, yes.
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:40.840]   As their digital strategist, nice going, Baratunde.
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:41.840]   Yes.
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:42.840]   That's really great.
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.920]   That's a pleasure that guy.
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:49.960]   A chapter two Lisa Bettany, chapter three Gina Trappani, chapter four, we're Tom Merritt,
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:55.000]   chapter five, Veronica Belmont, Omala, chapter six, Chase Jarvis.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.680]   This is, can't wait to, when will you be done?
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:58.880]   How many chapters total?
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:00.920]   Yeah, 10 chapters.
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:01.920]   Okay.
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:02.920]   So we're almost done.
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:05.080]   I mean, really most of the book is finished.
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:08.920]   We're still over the next couple of months releasing the last two chapters.
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:12.800]   And if you missed like say the Baratunde chapters are a way that you could read that now.
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:13.800]   Yes.
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:18.720]   So one of the great, one of the reasons we've done this, the way we're doing it, releasing
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:22.720]   one chapter at a time to give people a chance to read it while we're working on it, is so
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:25.000]   that we can get feedback from users.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:30.000]   And one of the, one of our readers suggested they're like, hey, I missed one of these chapters
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.600]   and I pre-ordered the book.
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:32.600]   Yeah.
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:35.120]   And they're like, could I actually just get access to the other ones online?
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:36.600]   And we thought, that's a great idea.
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:41.480]   So now if you pre-order the book, any of the versions, it's available in e-book, audio
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:43.360]   book, paperback and hardback.
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:48.640]   If you pre-order any of the versions of the book, we will send you a confirmation email
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:53.200]   and with that you'll get the way that you can access the full archive of the chapters
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:55.000]   that have already published.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.000]   Follow the geek.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000]   Yes.
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.000]   Follow the geekspluralbook.com.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000]   Yes.
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000]   Absolutely.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.600]   And thanks to your co-author, Lindsey Gilpin, we've got to give her credit as well.
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:07.920]   Lindsey's amazing.
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:14.400]   And we split the work 50/50 and really it wouldn't have happened for her because I've
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:18.440]   been saying I should write this book for years and Lindsey was like, well, you should do
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:19.440]   it now.
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.440]   Yeah.
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:21.440]   And what are you waiting for?
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:23.600]   And so if it weren't for her, this wouldn't have happened.
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:29.280]   And she's also an amazing writer and just a great, great, great person.
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:31.800]   Also Tech Republic, one other piece of news.
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:37.880]   Tech Republic, we just hired somebody that, that Twitter listeners will know very well.
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:40.680]   Dan Patterson is going to, yes.
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:41.680]   Nice.
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:46.640]   One of the best tech reporters in the business.
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:49.840]   And Dan comes to work for us in October.
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:51.760]   So we just announced it this week.
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:56.440]   And Dan will be a writer, senior writer for Tech Republic.
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:00.120]   He'll also be doing some podcasting and some other things as well.
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:04.040]   And so yes, very well known to Twit listeners.
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:05.040]   That's great.
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:07.800]   And finally Dan has found a home.
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.600]   He's been traveling all over the internet and he's great.
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:11.600]   Love Dan.
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:12.760]   All right, good.
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:13.760]   Nice.
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:15.520]   Thank you all so for being here.
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:19.760]   Steve Kovac, congratulations on the new kind of new gig.
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:20.760]   Yeah, thank you.
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:24.160]   We've been live for about a month, actually almost exactly a month now.
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:26.120]   So it's steaming right along.
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:27.120]   It's really beautiful.
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:28.120]   Check it out.
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:30.040]   You know, I like it's very clean, very simple.
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.600]   Oh, wait a minute, I'm running an ad blocker.
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:33.600]   Never mind.
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:37.240]   No, it's actually, it's gorgeous.
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:38.440]   Really nice design.
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:41.440]   And I like the mix because it isn't just kind of geeky stuff.
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:44.200]   It's a particle about all of her sex.
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:45.920]   And then it aren't about the Apple TV.
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:49.400]   We're not just another gizmo gadget blog.
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:53.040]   We're really exploring these themes of innovation and digital culture.
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:58.120]   You know, tech is just one nugget of everything we are our ambitions.
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:02.280]   So you'll see iPhone news, but you'll see a lot of other really cool stuff too.
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:03.280]   It looks really nice.
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:04.280]   Yeah, really looks good.
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:08.560]   We're really proud of the team and what we're doing and more to come.
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:10.520]   We're just going to get grown, grow and grow.
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:12.240]   I can't wait.
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:18.600]   Everybody should run to techinsider.io and follow along with Steve's Twitter feed because
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:20.640]   it's at Steve.
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:23.880]   Say the least.
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:25.720]   Hey, thank you for being here, everybody.
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:27.880]   We appreciate you're watching Twitch each and every week.
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:30.920]   If you want to watch live, it's fun to do that.
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:33.720]   You could do that 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:39.600]   That's 2,200 UTC on Twitch.tv, Twitch.tv/live if you want the specific page.
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:40.600]   You can also be here in studio.
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:42.120]   We had a great studio audience.
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:43.440]   Thank you all for being here today.
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:50.520]   I know it is always a very long, boring show, but you stayed, most of you.
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:53.360]   If you want to be here in the audience, we'll try to get you a comfortable chair.
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:54.360]   Can't promise.
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:55.360]   Email.
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:57.000]   I'm really selling it, aren't I?
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000]   Even on tickets.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.000]   I just feel guilty.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.000]   I'm sorry.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.840]   Tickets at Twitch.tv and we'll try to be nice to you.
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:08.680]   I think soon a can of Dintymore under every chair, I think is the new.
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:11.240]   I think that's the new way we're going to get people.
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:13.680]   I may be wrong.
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:17.240]   If you can't watch live or be in the studio live, there is a third way.
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:22.280]   All of the shows on Twitter available after the fact on demand, either from our website,
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:24.880]   Twitch.tv or where you get your shows.
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:29.880]   There's lots of places, of course, iTunes and the Xbox Store and your podcast app on
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:30.880]   your mobile device.
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:31.880]   There's even Twit apps.
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:36.400]   We don't write them, but some great Twit apps from our third party developers on all the
[02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:42.000]   platforms, iOS, Android, Windows, Phone, even Roku, and that'll make it easy for you to
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.880]   watch wherever you want, whenever you want.
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:44.880]   We just want you to watch.
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:46.680]   Make sure you subscribe that way you want me to this episode.
[02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:47.680]   I'm Leo Leport.
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:48.680]   Thanks for being here.
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:49.680]   Wait a minute.
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:51.800]   Before I go, do we know who's on triangulation tomorrow?
[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:53.280]   Because I always forget to promote that.
[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:55.400]   We always have great people.
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:58.160]   Let me just, I could probably quickly check.
[02:19:58.160 --> 02:19:59.160]   I'll do that.
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:01.960]   I should have done that before the show.
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:04.680]   I'm not very well prepared.
[02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:07.560]   Triangulation is our Monday morning review show.
[02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:10.080]   Oh, Drew Curtis is coming up.
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:11.080]   That'll be fun.
[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:12.080]   That Alan Stern?
[02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:15.960]   Alan Stern, who's the principal investigator for the New Horizons.
[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:20.680]   That's the satellite that just went around Pluto and is now going on to the Kuiper Belt.
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:21.680]   That'll be really great.
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:23.640]   We'll talk space tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:25.720]   That's the next show I do.
[02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:26.720]   Thanks for being here.
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:27.720]   We'll see you next time.
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:28.720]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:29.720]   Bye-bye.
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:29.720]   [applause]
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:31.720]   [music]
[02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:32.720]   [applause]
[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:33.720]   [music]
[02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:34.720]   [applause]
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:35.720]   [music]
[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:36.720]   [applause]
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:37.720]   [music]
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:38.720]   [applause]
