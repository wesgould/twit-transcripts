[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.100]   It's the show where we take the tech news of the week and rummage through it like a man
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.020]   going through an old couch looking for enough change to buy the G4 TV network.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.300]   I'm Father Robert Ballisare, the digital Jesuit in for Leo Laporthe, tech guy who was
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.860]   currently at some super bowl shaped sporting event that I cannot describe without the
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.460]   express written consent of the NFL.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.620]   We've got a great panel starting with our very own Mr. Tom Merritt Ace, the tech Tom
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.380]   coming from a studio in Los Angeles.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.820]   How are things down in Lala World?
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.820]   They are lovely.
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.060]   Thanks for having me on, Father Robert.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.060]   This is awesome.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.500]   I'm excited about this panel.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.740]   I am also quite excited, especially since we have your frame rate cohort, Mr. Brian Brushwood,
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.700]   fresh off of his, what were your duties again?
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.700]   Archduke of awesome, the Sultan of scam.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.580]   It's not being the Archduke of awesome and the Sultan of scam.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.460]   They're opposing titles, so you have to wear a lot of different hats.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.460]   You know how it goes.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.700]   I don't know how to write material.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.780]   You come in, you're doing a stand up comedy routine, right?
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.780]   Go time, man.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.780]   You're going to make me look bad.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.180]   It's how we roll.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.340]   That's how we roll.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.980]   Speaking of how we roll, we've got this whole manajat twit thing going on here.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.340]   We've got people who have been on each other's shows, so we've got the very lovely, the
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.580]   very special, the very geeky, Veronica Belmont.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.380]   Veronica, thank you for coming on.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.380]   Thank you.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.620]   Yeah, I guess I've hosted shows with most of the people on the panel today.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.740]   They're actually just Tom and Brian, actually.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.300]   Yeah, I feel like a fourth wheel.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   Sorry, it's okay.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.300]   Fourth.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.140]   Depends what kind of vehicle you're riding.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.220]   Anyways, let me introduce you to someone who is not a fourth or fifth wheel.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.180]   Mr. Tim Stevens, the emperor of Engagit.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.180]   Is that what we're presenting?
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.180]   Is that what we're coming in?
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.180]   Is that what we're coming in?
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.180]   Yeah, I think that'll do.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.180]   That'll do for today.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.180]   And you actually are in studio.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.180]   You're not Sky being like these other people.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.180]   You're the first time, and it's pretty awesome to be here.
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.180]   I'm a shame.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.180]   This is your first time in the first time?
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.180]   First time Paluma, too.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.180]   Yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.180]   Oh, what do you think?
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.180]   Why do you guys show us up, Tim?
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.680]   Well, you know, I just thought I'd come here and be sociable, and it turns out nobody
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.680]   else is here.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.580]   And I, we're going to have a good show.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.400]   You guys can jump in whenever you want to.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.340]   We're going to have a couple of beers, eat some buffalo.
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.200]   I'm going to eat most of the buffalo wings, but you know, that's just how we do things.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   But let's get right to it.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.360]   You guys are in the same place.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   You're just going to end up sharing diseases.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.760]   You've got to stay in your own cubicle, don't you see?
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.660]   All the experienced hosts know to stay in our little robo boxes here.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.660]   I've got a lot of hands in.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.400]   We've been here for 78 days.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.560]   It's getting a little stuck.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.720]   But I have plenty of supplies, so I should be good for another couple months, at least.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.280]   And we all know that Tom Merritt is in front of a green screen, so he really could be
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   anywhere right now.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.280]   Right.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   There's a best darn green screen.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   He could be right behind you.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   Right.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.440]   Tom is in the back room.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.880]   We're just projecting him into the set.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.080]   That's again, that's how to it rolls.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   Magic.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.080]   Fantastic.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.080]   Let's get to it.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.160]   We've got the first story about the big game about that super bully type thing, but
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   we're not talking about football.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.760]   I remember I promised you wasn't going to be about the Super Bowl, but rather about
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   the Super Bowl tech.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.040]   We've got a story coming out of ours, Technica, talking about how the Super Dome is being
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.720]   wired to be wireless.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.680]   They're hoping to serve up to 30,000 simultaneous connections with 700 access points on the
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.040]   inside of the Super Dome and 250 access points on the outside of the Super Dome.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.240]   Now what strikes me about this is it's a lot like we saw going on with the Olympics where
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.720]   they're going to have sort of the Wi-Fi police roaming the Super Dome, looking for, quote unquote,
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.240]   rogue wireless devices.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.920]   They don't want you turning on your Wi-Fi.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.760]   They don't want you turning on your phone to create a hotspot because it will interrupt
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.080]   the Wi-Fi experience of the people around them.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.000]   I want to throw this to you, Veronica, first, when you're talking about this many people
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.720]   in that small of a space, we've just come to expect Wi-Fi won't work, right?
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.000]   I mean, that's how it goes at big events like this.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   The local towers can only, at least for LTE or 4G coverage, can only handle so many connections
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   at one time.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.840]   But if they're doing Wi-Fi, I mean, how many people, 73,208 fans, that's a very specific
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.440]   number of people, by the way, that they posted in this article.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   So it might be enough, but it always comes down to the day of to really see how well
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.840]   this kind of thing works out.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.640]   But even very tech savvy events like South by Southwest and CES have yet to have a very
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.920]   successful, like totally online internet connection for users.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   Right.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.040]   Yes, CES is usually disaster.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.840]   This year, I think was better than most, but each year they bring in the trucks and
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.760]   the extra antennas and get everything set up so that you can have more connectivity.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.760]   But each year, something goes down.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.680]   And I don't know, this sounds like a big bowl of fail to me.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.160]   I can't imagine this is going to work.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.280]   I don't think there's enough cows in the United States to make this possible.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.080]   Is there any comment on the level of service that they're promising to everyone?
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.040]   Are you going to like a half megabit or just barely dial up speeds out of this?
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.480]   Well, I mean, they're hoping to provide enough connectivity so that you can tweet and send
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.480]   out pictures.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.000]   I mean, that's really what you'd like in a event like this, right?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.080]   You want to generate the buzz.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.680]   You want people to be excited about the event.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.920]   And you could possibly do that, but I mean, you're definitely not going to get enough
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.160]   bandwidth to stream anything for a consistent amount of time.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.600]   Now what you can do, if you're dealing with 700 access points, you turn the power on those
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.160]   access points way, way, way down so that each one only serves a very small area.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.080]   But even so, when you're dealing with that many people in that small of a space, there's
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.120]   really no technology that can get around the laws of physics.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.040]   Why wouldn't they just, why provide this at all?
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.000]   Why not have everyone rely on their own data connections with their cellular providers?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.040]   Is this something that is AT&T working with them on this?
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.040]   What's the upside for them outside of giving a good experience?
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.720]   Like anyone cares about that.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   Right.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.040]   Well, I mean, the upside is they look like a Ford looking organization.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.320]   I mean, you want to provide people Wi-Fi and theoretically, if people are using the five
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:20.000]   gigahertz Wi-Fi range, you can get much, much better service because there's three channels
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   in the 2.4 gigahertz range.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.200]   There's 23 channels in the five gigahertz range that, you know, and because it's unlicensed
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.040]   spectrum, you can do a lot more creative use of micro cells to actually increase the amount
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.640]   of throughput people can get.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.640]   You know what I find really interesting is how this is exactly the opposite of what they
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.120]   wanted to do at the inauguration.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.320]   Because at the inauguration, they were trying to prevent people really from sending a lot
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.000]   of photos and doing a lot of text messaging because they were trying to save bandwidth
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.080]   for actual phone calls and emergencies and things like that.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.040]   So it's interesting that now they're like, we're going to provide Wi-Fi so you guys can
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.160]   share as much media as you possibly want.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.280]   But I'm wondering how that's going to either free up more space for phone call communications
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.160]   or if it's just going to be, if that part of the deal will be bad.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.200]   Yeah, I wonder if that's part of it because I know the Ars Technica article says they
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.320]   were testing a 20-meg down, 20-meg up synchronous.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.960]   They knew that that was going to go down once you get started to get people turning on their
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960]   phones.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.840]   But their guess was if 100% of the people didn't have gadgets going at the same time,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.080]   they were going to be able to handle it.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   They were confident.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.400]   It'll be interesting to see if they are.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.480]   But the other thing here is they're trying to reduce interference, right?
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.960]   So if you allow everybody to just run their own cameras, run their own data points, all
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.560]   of a sudden it doesn't work for anybody because you have no control over the system.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:41.360]   And what they're trying to attempt here is say, let's say no other interference going
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.160]   on except the interference we're providing through Wi-Fi.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.280]   Give everybody who has a ticket free access.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.880]   There's no password.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   You just log on.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   You get Wi-Fi instantaneously.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.480]   And that means that they can at least try to control the experience and make sure they
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.160]   have good bandwidth, not just for the folks in the seats, but for the folks in the press
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.520]   area, for the people who are actually running the game and need to communicate with each
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   other.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   Clear as up that air for emergency signals and all of that.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.320]   And Father Robert, you're saying that you can't get around the laws of physics.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   I'm curious.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.520]   Like, let's say it all goes well and they keep people from turning on their wireless
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.160]   cameras and their Wi-Fi hotspots and their iPhones because they get good Wi-Fi.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.600]   What else could go wrong?
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.120]   Well, unfortunately, when you're dealing with unlicensed spectrum, it only takes one device.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.000]   Well, let's be realistic.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.580]   It takes a half dozen devices to really screw up the air.
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.760]   If you've got a phone that has been hacked to operate in frequencies that it's not supposed
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.040]   to operate and it doesn't have the proper frequency filters, the cut filters, what
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.840]   will happen is it essentially acts like a signal jammer.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.680]   If you remember back to the early days of Wi-Fi when geeks like me were hacking access
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.120]   points and you found software switches where you could suddenly turn up the power of the
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.600]   output to like a hundred milliwatts and it sounded great, but all you were really doing
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.560]   was jamming the airwaves.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.000]   Well, that's the problem of physics that you can't get around, which is it's a shared
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   spectrum.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.520]   It's not like everyone has a direct connection to the outbound router.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.680]   You're using the same wireless space.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.640]   So if you have people who are not playing well, it destroys experience for everyone in
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.800]   the area.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.560]   So here's what I think is interesting is you're talking about the technological achievement,
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.600]   which I think is interesting to see how far it's developed.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.560]   But also you mentioned that one of the biggest problems you're looking at is they hope that
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.400]   not everyone will be using their devices at the same time.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.800]   And in that regard, you almost have a sociological experiment happening.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.520]   And I wonder how far the science has advanced on monitoring the way people tend to use their
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   devices.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.640]   Is there a particular point during every football game that you're like, oh, this happens
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.880]   is when everyone gets on and are they, I wonder if they're making any decisions about the
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.480]   program to mitigate how basically shaping the human traffic in addition to the network
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   traffic.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   I remember I'm sorry.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.840]   I was going to say, I think their best guess is probably that not everybody has a cell
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.920]   phone, not everybody carries a cell phone, even though maybe the majority do.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.240]   So that alone would probably keep you from having a hundred percent usage.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.880]   It's like the bathroom on an airplane, the one time that you don't want to be using the
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.160]   internet in a stadium is when a timeout gets called or when there's a foul on the play.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.360]   Because at that moment, if you think about it, a football game is really only a couple
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.200]   of minutes of activity surrounded by a lot of waiting.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.160]   And in that waiting, people are going to naturally, like they've become prone to do,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.040]   pull out their phones and check their email, check their tweets, see if the last tweet
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.200]   got any traction was retweeted, that it's sort of human nature now, right?
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.280]   So I'm done with Brian.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.160]   I think this is a sociological experiment that they can look at later on.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.360]   They can actually filter through this data to find out where the spikes were in usage.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.440]   And I'm betting it's going to be at halftime when everyone's going to want to send pictures.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   It's like go big or go home.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.920]   If you're going to do 30,000 simultaneous connections, just do 73,208 simultaneous connections.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   Just see how that goes.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   Exactly.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   They just cover your bases.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.560]   Sorry, I know that's a baseball metaphor.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.560]   We're talking about football.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   Well, I like the baseball thing.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   The baseball thing.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.560]   The baseball thing.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.560]   Because we're also this.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.640]   A rear end zone.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.960]   This is going to help us bust up the laws of physics here.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.400]   This is something that I brought in a while back for this week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.720]   This is actually an access point, but it's not a regular one.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:25.800]   It's 24 radios that has a specially designed RF reflector inside of it that divides the
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   area around it into different parts.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.920]   So it's physically separating the beams of RF that, of course, that go into different
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   devices.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.360]   The whole thing about a solution like this is these have been specifically designed for
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.240]   environments like a stadium where you have a lot of people in a very small area.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.960]   So I talked to the people at Xeris and they were saying how they have set up stadiums
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.080]   in the past.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.720]   And whereas the Superdome is using between 700 to 950 access points, this could do the
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.440]   same job with about 50.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.040]   Well they also be vacuuming up the popcorn and the leavings from the tail getting part
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.040]   of it.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040]   Of course, of course, that comes with it.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.040]   It's a very, very exciting game.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   They also start beeping if there's a fire.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   It's really helpful.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.040]   It's really helpful to have amazing, amazing.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.760]   You can also make a pancake inside of it.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.920]   Bacon pancakes.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.920]   You could wear it in a rainstorm.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.920]   It becomes a very nasty pack.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   That's crazy.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920]   That is crazy.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.920]   It's good stuff.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.920]   It's good stuff.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.560]   Now they're using Cisco series switches and wireless controllers.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.720]   Are you familiar with those at all, Father Robert?
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   Yes.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.880]   So basically all of the wireless gear from Cisco and HP, Avaya, the big players, they
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.520]   work the same way in that the AP itself is kind of, it's a dumb device.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.680]   They need to be plugged into a controller, which looks like a big switch.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.840]   And then the switch will actually communicate with the various nodes that are plugged into
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.800]   it to find out how to optimally set itself.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.360]   It's a fascinating part of the process.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.120]   They speak about it very briefly when they say that they're going to be doing real-time
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.240]   spectrum analysis of the superdome, where they're going to have people walking around
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.440]   with these little scopes, looking at what areas are congested, and then the controller
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.760]   can adjust each access point to either increase or decrease the power to sort of optimize
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.960]   the number of people it can serve.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.720]   And then after the game, the game is all getting ripped out.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.040]   I mean, is this just temporary for Sunday?
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.800]   You know, I would not be surprised if this was a huge sponsorship thing.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.160]   And so these access points are probably very visible areas around the superdome, which
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.480]   means that they leave them there.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.480]   They're going to get stolen.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.040]   Verizon apparently paid for the installation a lot of this stuff.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.120]   So I don't know if that means they'll leave it.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   But yeah.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.120]   No.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.480]   But that's pretty much all I want to talk about the Super Bowl.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.560]   Are we done with that big skin thing?
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.440]   I'm actually more excited about the wife.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.520]   How well the Wi-Fi is going to do if this big gargantuan attempt is going to work or
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.520]   not.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.520]   I'm cheering for it.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.520]   I really am.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520]   I'm like, I hope it works really well.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.520]   I can't wait to hear the report.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.520]   We've got Leo's there.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.560]   So you know we're going to find out from him whether it worked or not.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   Right.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.880]   Well, I'm just thinking we're going to be pushing up to the time that Leo would be in the superdome.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.760]   I'm wondering if our incredibly talented producer might be able to contact him and see
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.120]   if we could get a video stream at some point.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   Lovely and talented.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.640]   I'm going to figure they're shutting that down though.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.480]   I mean, they can't be letting people just stream the video.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   Can they from the Super Bowl?
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   They're going to be restricting that.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.280]   Oh, you're assuming they're doing proper security policy.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   I mean, no.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.640]   Well, they did say they were going to be wandering around.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.640]   So who knows?
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.640]   One way to find out.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   We'll try it.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   We'll try it.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.640]   So we'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:29.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:24.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:13.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   We'll try to find out what we're going to do.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.640]   We'll just constantly go a little bit too noisy.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   You can filter, you can go on the left and pick whatever you want,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:51.640]   two text messages or BBM's or whatever you like.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.640]   That's pretty much it.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.640]   I'll give you a little bit more.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.640]   On the background, we've got this plastic key background that comes off.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.640]   Ultimately, it's a nice piece of hardware.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.640]   It's a big, big step up over what we've seen before.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   Bb10 is a huge step forward over Bb7.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.640]   Here you are, sir.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.640]   I'm touching it.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.640]   You feel the power?
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   It's just not exactly a revolution in any way.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.640]   The gestures are nice for sure.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   I think Blackberry Hub would be a great tool for somebody who gets a small number of messages
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.640]   over a lot of different services.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.640]   For someone like me who gets a lot of messages on a lot of services,
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.640]   it was just very quickly impossible to keep up with everything that's going on in there, unfortunately.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.640]   But app selection is a little bit limited, but for NUOS it's pretty good.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.640]   They're lacking Netflix and Hulu and a couple big ones,
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.640]   but they've got Dropbox, they've got Hockey Night in Canada as well.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   Again, for the Canadians, you can be very happy about that.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   It's a bit of a mixed bag for sure.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   It's certainly not the amazing return to form that we might have hoped that RIM now Blackberry
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.640]   would be able to deliver to us, but I think it's a really good step.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.640]   I think it's enough to keep the Blackberry faithful faithful for a little bit longer.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.640]   What about Alicia Keys?
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   We brought Alicia Keys back to the fold, I'm happy to say.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.640]   Despite the fact that she has an iOS exclusive app and despite the fact that she's saying
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.640]   next to Steve Jobs for the iTunes launch, Alicia Keys is now the creative...
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.640]   -Creative director. -Creative director, right.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.640]   -Glorbial creative director. -Glorbial creative director.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   -Glorbial creative director. -Thank you for Blackberry.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.640]   Thank you. You never want to leave off a global and so much title.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   So she and also Neil Gaiman are going to be helping out to kind of raise the street,
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.640]   create a Blackberry a little bit, which I think ultimately, you know, couldn't hurt.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.640]   Neil Gaiman, I didn't hear about that.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   Neil Gaiman has signed on, he sold his soul to RIM now Blackberry.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.640]   People in the chat room want to see the keyboard, the on screen keyboard here.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.640]   Yeah, so I can do a little bit of typing here if you want.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.640]   Basically, let's see if I can create a note for a document.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.640]   Go in this crash log here that I had to create before.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.640]   So edit. Give me a keyboard.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   There we go. So it's got this great predictive text that is a lot like Swiftkey on Android,
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.640]   if you've ever used that, so I can type H.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   -The clicking right. -It does make a clicking noise if you turn it on.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.640]   -Now the flicking of words up into the...
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   -Yes, so I typed H, I meant to type H-E, but I actually hit HR,
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.640]   but you can see it says, "Hello over the L, so I'm going to swipe up"
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.640]   and Bingo puts in "Hello."
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.640]   And now it's suggesting everyone, so I can just swipe up from E and get everyone.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.640]   -Can you just keep on going until the whole letter is written?
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.640]   -Yeah, I see what kind of thing I can write here without actually typing anything.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.640]   Everyone else has to...
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.640]   -I'm exactly going to change the way that people are writing because you can be like,
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.640]   "Oh, that sounds a good word. I'll use that instead."
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   -I predicted that word. Why not?
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.640]   -This is amazing. This is a revolutionary opinion.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   -Fine.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   -Vironic, this isn't the first keyboard.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   -This is how the robots win.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640]   -This is how the robots win.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640]   -Okay, I'm just saying how it starts.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.640]   -Let me just place a general questionnaire.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.640]   Who here has ever changed the word they're trying to type based on the prediction of the phone?
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   I don't want to put the real world...
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640]   -You'll think. -We were just doing this.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   -Ono corrects on there. I'm just like, "Eh, that's pretty good sentence."
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.640]   -This is a pretty good sentence considering I didn't mean to type any of that
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.640]   and it just sort of suggested all of it.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.640]   I don't know where that came from.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   -Viron was writing something on his iPhone today and it corrected it, like, "Hello to Hodor."
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.640]   -That's actually pretty good.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.640]   Even you typed a significant sentence in a short amount of time.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   -Yeah, I did the Red Fox News over the "Lazy Dog" thing.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.640]   It took me about a little over 10 seconds on this type of thing, which isn't too bad.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.640]   I was a little bit quicker than Swivky. I did back to back.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.640]   I think it was just under 10 seconds Swivky, but it's pretty good.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.640]   The thing is, if you use Swivky, you can just kind of hit the space bar
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.640]   and the suggested word that it thinks you're going to use is always right in the middle,
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.640]   which is nice so you can kind of get used to looking there.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.640]   Here you have to actually look down and follow your thumbs,
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   which takes a little bit of a different way of thinking.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.640]   If you're used to touch typing, not looking down,
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.640]   you actually have to look down here a little bit more,
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   which takes a little bit of getting used to.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.640]   I still like Swivky better, but this is by far the best Doc keyboard
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.640]   in any mobile operating system, in my opinion.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.640]   -Let me ask you this.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   There's going to be a lot of buzz about the hardware,
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   because we were talking about this before the show.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   It's not that it leapfrogs all the competition out there,
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.640]   but it does look a lot better than anything Blackberry has ever put out before.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.640]   -Yeah, I certainly can start with them up to date anyway.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.640]   They're current now.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   They didn't go ahead by any means.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   But the one thing lacking, of course, was a QWERTY keyboard.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   I think a lot of people were really hoping that there would be a QWERTY device,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   and RIM was kind of being a little cagey that we would see the new QWERTY device,
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.640]   but they didn't say when we would actually get to buy it.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.640]   So now we know the Q10 is coming, but probably not until April.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   That would be basically this device with a keyboard.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.640]   We still don't know all the details or the internals on that guy,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   but a 3.1-inch display, and sort of a 4.2 on here.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   But that'll have the traditional, you know, clicky keyboard
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   that you've come to experience a lot like the one in the Bold 9900.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   It feels like a really nice device.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.640]   In fact, the metal bars that go across, the display are actually integrated to the chassis,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   so it's got a really good rigidity too for twisting.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   I think it'll be a nice phone, but again, you've got to wait another two months at this point.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   -All right.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.640]   Let me ask an open question to the panel, and that is,
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.640]   does this save Blackberry?
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   I mean, does this hold on to the people who are still using Blackberrys?
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   Might this even get a few people back in the enterprise who want a more secure platform for communications,
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   or does this just get them to the level playing field
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.640]   with say Windows, Phone, Android, and iOS?
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   -You want to watch that one? -We're trying not to talk about what we like.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.640]   -I'll be a good girl, bye girl.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.640]   -I'll go first.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   I think this stems the tide.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   -It doesn't turn the tide.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   -So it may keep Blackberry from just continuing to slide downhill.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   I think it will, actually, because Tim said it already.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   This is going to appeal to current Blackberry fans.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.640]   They're going to be very excited about this.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   It may bring a few more Alicia Keys back into the fold,
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   but I don't think anyone looks at Samsung Galaxy S and then looks at the Blackberry and says,
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   "Oh, I want that more."
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   The iPhone users, the Samsung users, there's not enough here to turn their heads yet, I don't think.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   -I think it speaks volumes.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   Roger Chang, of course, our friend and my producer on Texilla,
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.640]   he was a Blackberry user for years and he recently went over to Android.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.640]   I don't know if this is enough to bring him back.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.640]   He just signed another two-year contract, but I don't think the hopes of something better
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   on Blackberry was enough to keep him there even.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.640]   -I think some people might come back when the Q10 comes up,
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.640]   because I think a lot of people left around the time of the bold,
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   and they went to the iPhone or something like that,
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.640]   which have been swearing at the virtual keyboard for the past few years,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640]   a couple months.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.640]   I think when the Q10 comes out, we'll see some people kind of making the transition back to Blackberry,
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   but yeah, I don't think it's going to be a flood.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   -There is something to be said about a physical keyboard.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   I mean, I still miss it, even though the keyboard is not.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.640]   -No, there's not.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   They're stupid and nobody should use them anymore.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   Thank goodness.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   Set-fire the physical keyboards, unless it's a full-size device that you could do this on.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   -Well, what do you really feel about that, Brian?
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.640]   -I don't understand this nostalgia for physical keys,
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   because it's like you literally -- the great -- the best advancement from the iPhone
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.640]   is the fact that it corrects -- it encourages sloppy writing.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.640]   As long as you pretty much get it right, it does, for the most part,
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   a pretty good job of getting out what you want,
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   and it does it astonishingly fast.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   You don't have to go back and fix it most of the times.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   -You're nuts.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.640]   -And yes, there's the occasional hilarious on the correct stuff.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.640]   -I do not agree with that statement.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   -I'm telling you, ma'am.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   Like, physical keys -- I tried to use them as Blackberry.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   It's like, "You mean I have to hit every single key,
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.640]   and I have to do it right every time? Screw that, man.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.640]   I hate physical keyboards.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   I want autocorrective predictive text for these physical keyboards
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.640]   so that all my desktops, I can just sort of mash the keys
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.640]   and get it pretty much right, and there it is.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.640]   -I have to say, so I understand the enjoyment of a physical keyboard.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   Although, I think my iPhone is getting dumber over time,
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   not smarter with guessing what I want to say.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   I've had much better luck with actually dictating text to it,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   rather than trying to type in very quickly.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   So maybe it's just I'm getting lazy, but it has not been good for me lately.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.640]   And of course, without that, we wouldn't have damn autocorrect,
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   which is hilarious.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.640]   -I understand we have a special visitor on the line right now.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.640]   We're going to -- Oh, my goodness.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   -Wow.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   -Whoa.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.640]   -Wait, is that Mr. LePorte in the super dome?
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   -That's amazing.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   -Just before his arrest.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   -I can't hear a thing.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   -And you're live in three, two, and you're go.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.640]   Go for Leo.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   Leo, we need you to do the average.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.640]   -I can't hear a thing.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.640]   -So he's saying he can't hear a thing that we're saying
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   because it's so loud in the super dome.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.640]   He also doesn't have earphones in it.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640]   -You're pretty sure he's going to be in a arena,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.640]   perhaps at a concert of some sort, maybe --
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.640]   -Greatful dead.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.640]   -Maybe it's the new kid in the block reunion that he's seeing.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.640]   -I can't.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.640]   -He's able to report massive success on the Wi-Fi.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.640]   -I was very say that.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   -Jesse Jackson.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.640]   -Did you say something about Jesse Jackson?
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.640]   -I think he just did.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.640]   -I think he did.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.640]   -I think he did.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.640]   -Okay, chat Rome.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.640]   Animated gift time.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.640]   Actually, Chad, if you could get with Leo and ask him to send us a vine.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.640]   -A vine?
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.640]   -I think he is sending us a vine.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   -It is.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   See, it's only in six-second spurts, you see.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.640]   -And Leo is done.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.640]   -Well, I don't think that could have gone any better, really.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   -No, no, that's pretty much the whole most.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   -You think that the quality looked pretty good?
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   -But that stadium is almost empty at the moment.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   There's nobody there.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.640]   -Now, what time does the game actually start?
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.640]   -It starts when we finish.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   They're waiting.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   -Oh, it's good of them.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   -Yeah.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   -That's really good of them.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   -Yeah, of course.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   -That's theoretically there'd be more usage now
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.640]   than there might be, like, when the actual play is going on.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   -It's very true.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.640]   -The play?
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.640]   -Yeah.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.640]   -The Shakespeare play is different.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   -It's the theater and the round begins.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   -Yes.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   -Does mother know that you wear her drapes?
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   -No, no, no, okay, hold on.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.640]   Wait, I want to get back to the Blackberry X here
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.640]   because I just realized I'm pissed because --
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.640]   No, I do like the physical keyboard.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   -Yeah, physical keyboard.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   -I miss the physical keyboard.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   -Of course, I mean, yeah, it's small,
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   but you know what I can do with the physical keyboard
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.640]   that I can't do with the virtual?
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   I can type without looking at the screen.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.640]   You can do what?
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.640]   I can type without looking at the screen.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.640]   How often do you do that?
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   Okay, I'm not going to say that I have done this,
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.640]   but theoretically, if my eyes had to be somewhere,
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   like maybe on the road, while I was typing on an iPhone,
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   maybe theoretically I had the ability to type out
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   even without looking at the screen.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   And I thought, in fact, like, I actually could see a future
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   where it gets so good at reading your general movements
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.640]   where it's like you don't even see a keyboard anymore.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.640]   Instead, you just visualize the keyboard
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.640]   and start moving your thumbs where you think the key's
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.640]   ought to be, and then it gets so good at tracking
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   your personal quirks that it gets it right.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   -That's what happens a lot in chat room,
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.640]   which would explain many of the comments that we get.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.640]   But no, with a physical keyboard,
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.640]   I would never text while driving,
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.640]   but I have texted while giving a homily before,
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.640]   and it comes in very useful.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.640]   It's underneath my help.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.640]   Just --
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.640]   -You can say you're serving twice the people
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.640]   at the same time.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.640]   Is that what you tell the Jesuits?
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   -I'm multitasking.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.640]   Multitasking with God's grace.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.640]   -Really good.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.640]   -All right, there's our title.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   Okay, good.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.640]   -You know what?
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   -Oh, yeah.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.640]   -Before this gets even more off the rails,
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.640]   why don't we go back to Leo, who has a few things
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   to say about one of our sponsors.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.640]   -Doing this week in tech, I am, of course,
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   in New Orleans at the Super Bowl,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   but I am rooting for my team.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   They're going to take the field a little bit,
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.640]   but I thought I'd come back and talk about something
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.640]   that's kind of near and dear to my heart.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   The loved ones in your life.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   It is Valentine's Day in a couple of weeks,
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.640]   less than a couple of weeks, 11 days.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.640]   Are you ready, guys, to give --
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.640]   Let me tell you something.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   I used to get frozen on these gift-giving occasions.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.640]   Do you have any experiences?
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.640]   Because I knew I was never going to --
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.640]   I was going to get the wrong thing.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.640]   It was hard for me.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.640]   And so then you either get them something stupid
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.640]   at the last minute, or you give her a vacuum cleaner,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.640]   and then you're sleeping on the couch for a year.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   I can cut through this mess with ice.com.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.640]   They come back here every Valentine's Day
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   because they know they have --
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   they can help us, geeks.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.640]   Valentine's Day.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.640]   This is beautiful, and it is very good quality jewelry.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.640]   At a price anyone can afford.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   There's a wide range.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.640]   They have very expensive pieces.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.640]   If it's time for that engagement ring,
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   what is it they say?
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.640]   Three-month salary.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   Or if it's just, you know, you kind of like somebody
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.640]   and you want to give her a little something.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   A little something something.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   They're all there in very good prices, very high quality.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   Now, I am not a jewelry expert, but my honey is.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   And she loves this stuff.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.640]   In fact, this is not my honey.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   This is Shannon.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.640]   She's agreed to model some of the beautiful items.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.640]   They're not paying for mall locations.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.640]   They're not brick and mortar.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.640]   They're online, so you get the savings.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.640]   And we have a special deal for the Twitter audience.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.640]   But let me show you some of the beautiful jewelry available at ice.com.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   Give you an idea.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.640]   Three and a half carat.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.640]   This is a beautiful white sapphire.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.640]   A sterling silver heart-shaped pendant.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.640]   It would be a great gift to say, "Hey, I kind of like you."
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.640]   And I think Valentine, will you be my Valentine?
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.640]   Now, normally it's $115 with our Twit discount, $86.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.640]   Want to spend a little more?
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.640]   How about the One Carrot Morganite and Diamond 10K pink gold earrings?
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   She'll think you spent a packet of money on this one.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.640]   It's normally $225.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.640]   Our Twit Valentine's Day price is $186.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   How about this One Carrot created Emerald and Diamond 10K white gold ring?
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.640]   Gotta be careful with the ring, guys.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.640]   I could say something.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.640]   Maybe you want to say something.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.640]   Normally, $295, just $221.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:51.640]   Have a successful and memorable, if you know what I mean, Valentine's Day.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.640]   She's going to love this.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.640]   She's going to love you.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:34:00.640]   25% off most items plus free guaranteed delivery by Valentine's Day, as long as you order by
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.640]   February 12th at 1 p.m. Eastern, okay?
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.640]   So don't put this off.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.640]   Do it now while you're listening to Twit.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.640]   Go to ice.com/twit.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.640]   And start browsing around.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.640]   Take a look.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.640]   Find something.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.640]   I guarantee you she will love it.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   Easy to return, though, if she doesn't.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   And that's nice, too.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   That's a good piece of mine.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:28.640]   25% off most items plus free guaranteed delivery by Valentine's Day, but you've got to do it now, okay?
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   And this is available, of course, for a limited time.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:31.640]   Some restrictions apply.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.640]   We love ice.com.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.640]   We know you will, too.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:38.640]   Ice.com/twit.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   Let me tell you.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.640]   Guys, just a hint.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   Make your honey happy, okay?
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   All right, we have learned.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   I have learned.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   Now we get right back to this weekend tech, guys.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.640]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.640]   And the sultry tones of the one we were looking for.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   That's right.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.640]   And as we were discussing during the break, no, Leo doesn't trust us with the jewelry.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.640]   Yeah, I would have loved to be a hand model.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.640]   Maybe next time we can arrange that.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.640]   Well, if you come back, we'll let you hold the ice.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.640]   I did want to, before we move on from keyboard, Brian, have you heard of an app called Flexi?
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.640]   No.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   Flexi do.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   Because you were talking about this kind of randomly throwing your thumbs at the display.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   What Flexi does is basically it learns how you type and you can type anywhere on the display
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.640]   and it will figure out what you mean to say.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   Yes!
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   Oh, dude, what environment is this in?
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   Is it in my way?
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   iOS right now is kind of a test app and then I think there's an Android beta as well.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.640]   Doing it right now.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.640]   Okay, that's why I had to look that up while we were watching Leo do his thing.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.640]   Amazing.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.640]   So that's all.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   Problem solvers.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.640]   Problem solvers.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.640]   So, for the remainder of the broadcast, that's right.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   We've lost wood.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.640]   He'll be flexing himself.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   Ooh.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   Show title.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   All right, let's move on.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:57.640]   We've got, well, it's a message that you've heard a few times, but maybe it's happening this
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.640]   time and that is we are in a post PC era.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.360]   Maybe probably not really, but, you know, good tagline.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:11.720]   This comes from Gigalom talking about the IDC and their report that 52.5 million tablets
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:17.640]   shipped in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 89.8 million PCs.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.920]   And that means for the first time that tablet sales are over half of PC sales.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.960]   Tim, how do you break this down?
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.040]   Is this just the holiday burst?
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.640]   Is this going to be a trend?
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.840]   Are we eventually going to see parity here?
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.440]   How quickly are we going to see the "end" of the PC era?
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.840]   Well, it's definitely a trend.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.840]   I don't think that you can deny it any longer.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.440]   Exactly what that trend looks like through the rest of 2013.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.440]   I don't know.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.040]   I mean, definitely we've seen some acceleration of tablet sales and mobile device sales because
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.040]   of the holidays.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.200]   So, I think things will temper out a little bit throughout the rest of the year.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.960]   But ultimately, it is a trend that's going to continue.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   I don't think there's any doubt.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.960]   I mean, we, you know, we look at our traffic patterns and we definitely see the shift from
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   the desktop to the mobile device.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.960]   For us, it's a very real thing.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.760]   You know, we've been dealing with this for over a year now, effectively, in terms of
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:05.360]   the post-PC era quote unquote in terms of content consumption anyway.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.320]   So I definitely think it's a real thing and, you know, has a lot of strong implications
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.320]   for the industry.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.120]   Tablets are a lot cheaper than your average PC and your average laptop and how exactly
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.440]   your company is going to continue to show the growth that they need to.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.480]   Obviously, Apple is doing okay, but others, maybe not so much.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.880]   I just always wonder about these kind of numbers because there's always a question of how much
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.800]   are they playing with the figures here?
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.120]   Because yes, tablet sales are really accelerating.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.720]   They're growing way more than PC sales are growing, but that's just because PC sales
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.000]   are so mature.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.800]   We sell between what 360 to 400 million PCs a year.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.640]   Tablet sales are actually starting to catch up with that, but at the same time, there
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.400]   are many more people without tablets than are without PCs.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.240]   That doesn't necessarily mean that we're in a post-PC era.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:54.000]   It just means that more people who may need a PC already have a PC.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Yeah, the question.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   Go ahead.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.800]   And you're right, the term post-PC implies that we are done with the PC and now we've
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.960]   moved on to tablets was just simply isn't the case.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:08.040]   You think of everyone who has a tablet, they all, and I must say 90%, they all have it
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.440]   in addition to a PC.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.560]   What we're seeing is an opportunity for increased fidelity with your interactions, with your
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.040]   online data, and the way you communicate with the world.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.080]   There are certain some things that the PC will always be superior for.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:25.960]   I mean, right now, for doing this live skyping in with the live switching on here, Photoshop,
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.080]   video editing, video games, I mean, all of these things, we're not going to lose these
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:35.200]   things and the very nature of the term post-PC implies that, which is a bit annoying.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.920]   But if you think about it in terms of we're just seeing more options and people taking
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:44.520]   advantage, people like to interact with their data so much that they're buying a second
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.000]   and a third way to do so at all times.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Right.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.880]   I definitely agree with the idea that the idea of running everything in the cloud is
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.320]   probably what we're moving towards more than anything else.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.240]   And keeping the PC, keeping the keyboard, the mouse, the monitor as an interface method
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.340]   for that, it's still going to be more comfortable for most people than just having a tablet
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.340]   in your hand.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.800]   So I think these two things go hand in hand together.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.480]   I don't think we're at a point where people are just using tablets.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.680]   I think it's a point where people, like you said, are starting to have them as secondary
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.160]   devices that they use to interact with the data that they primarily input via a desktop
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.260]   environment.
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.260]   I really like that.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:27.420]   I like that point of view that we're more than anything about which devices we're using.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:31.260]   This is about where we're actually storing the information that we're manipulating.
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.400]   It used to be that everything was stored on your local device and you had control over
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.400]   it.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.120]   We're getting far more accustomed to being able to put it into a place that is accessible
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.940]   by multiple devices at the same time for multiple locations.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:48.500]   So if anything, it's the post local storage era, which is still disconcerting to me.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.980]   And I've got a rate at home and I've got a lot of stuff on there going all the way back
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:56.340]   to my early days of computing and the idea that at some point that's going to live on
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.700]   someone else's box that I don't get to manage is disconcerting to me.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.700]   Maybe that makes me an old, funny, dirty.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.700]   I don't know.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.700]   I don't think so.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.700]   Which is greater?
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.900]   Your fear of the information living somewhere else or, for example, my fear that if this
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:15.940]   house burns down, there's a lot of data that's just on one or two hard drives in this house.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:19.940]   And it's like, imagine all your photos, all your videos just wiped out.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:28.940]   Like at this point, I mean, I think conservatively I have three or four terabytes of video data
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.660]   spanning over the last four years.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.540]   That's just it's just on one or two drives.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.500]   And it's like, I don't see any way to migrate that to the cloud yet.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.300]   If there was, affordably, I would do it in a heartbeat.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.100]   Well, you can send a drive, I believe, to a lot of the services to actually get that
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.980]   data uploaded from their end.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.060]   I think some of them still do that, which is great.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:52.100]   But I think it's all about having your data in multiple locations, because having three
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:56.300]   or four redundant drives in your house is fine, except for the fact that if your house
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.060]   burns down and suddenly your SOL.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:03.660]   So it's about having a physical drive somewhere outside of your primary location, having a
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:08.620]   cloud backup just in case, and then having this stuff at home that you are accessing
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.620]   most frequently.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:15.780]   And I think we're moving towards a situation where it's all about form factor, right?
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.220]   And data does become ubiquitous.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.780]   And whether you're you're at Tim Stevens up there in New England, who runs his own home
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.620]   cloud server, it doesn't trust the man with his data.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.620]   I think that's fine.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.620]   That's a practical.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.620]   Wait, are we talking about Patrick Norton?
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.140]   There's a lot of internet kids.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.180]   But there's safe ways to do that and reasonable ways to do that.
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.020]   But you still want to be able to access that on devices.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.820]   And I still think back to this article I read back in the late '90s about how the future
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.780]   of computing was form factor over function.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:50.420]   So you have the device that works for the situation you're in, whether it's you need
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.740]   a keyboard and a screen, or whether you need a portable keyboard and a screen, or you just
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.660]   need a screen with a touch interface or a smaller device.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.100]   And we're almost there.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.980]   So I don't think it's a post-PC era.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:03.220]   It's just an entirely different era of computing.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.460]   Now this is not on the docks.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.860]   I'm kind of going off the rails as if the show was on the rails previously, but hold on.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:14.460]   The starting point brought up here, which is a big explosion of mobile devices, was in
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:19.620]   a way, a very big way, enabled by the use of what we're calling cloud storage, be it
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.060]   private cloud or public cloud.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.580]   There are stories right now.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.900]   There are a few issues that are before the Supreme Court debating whether or not data
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:33.100]   put into the cloud can really be private, whether or not law enforcement needs a warrant
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.940]   to actually look at that data after 180 days, whether or not they can look at email that
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:43.620]   you have quote unquote "abandon" on Google's or Yahoo's or Microsoft server.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.060]   If we don't sort that out, if we don't figure out a privacy policy that makes sense, that
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.340]   protects the rights of people who have put their data in the cloud, does that put the
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.980]   kibosh on the explosion of mobile devices?
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:02.020]   I suspect that the science fiction author and friend of mine, Andrew Maine, said a quote
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.300]   that really transformed my thinking.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.540]   And it's kind of changed my life.
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.380]   You said that technology outpaces legislation.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:12.460]   So when you ask a question like this, you think in terms of like, what can we do to protect
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.380]   the rights of people?
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.980]   Whatever it is you could do, whatever law you're thinking about writing, whatever action
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:22.380]   you're thinking your Congress should take, by the time it gets done, there will already
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.460]   be encryption services that take care of it faster.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.300]   And so I mean, I agree that this is an issue.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.820]   I agree that we need to, we have evolving attitudes about what it means to own your data.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:40.340]   But I don't know that it just seems like whatever happens by the time whatever laws
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.300]   passed will already be on to something else.
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.740]   It'll be a new set of problems.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.180]   I think we've also seen that people will, in general, choose convenience over security.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.060]   I mean, if indeed security was a concern, then Sony should have nobody playing a PlayStation
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.260]   3 game online right now.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.140]   But yet, you know, they rebounded very quickly.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.140]   And I don't think anybody's really thought about that over the past couple of weeks,
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.140]   months, years.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.460]   So I think that people are very willing to forget about those sorts of concerns, which
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.460]   is, you know, I think that is a concern in itself.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.340]   Well, it's interesting to see what people are willing and not willing to allow.
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:15.420]   Like for example, if you're going to be gaming online, you just know that your credit card
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.940]   information is now online somewhere.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.900]   And maybe it's taken care of properly.
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.900]   Maybe it's not.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.660]   I mean, we've had a breach in various online gaming vendors and that has exposed consumer
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.700]   information.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.020]   That seems to be okay.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:31.380]   I'm willing to expose my financial information.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:36.380]   However, people get really, really upset if you even suggest that law enforcement has
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:41.620]   the right to go into say a Yahoo account that you haven't opened in a year and just go through
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.260]   all your email, all your email.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.260]   That's actually in law.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.260]   They have that power.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.260]   They have that right.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.020]   But people don't seem to be up in arms about that.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.500]   So I'm always puzzled by what sets people off and what doesn't.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.500]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.740]   It's a it's a it's a poser.
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.540]   Well, and that email thing, it depends on the court, right?
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.220]   I mean, it's not quite as cut and dried as they can go in.
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.220]   You can also challenge it.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.460]   And people are challenging it.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.620]   And different judges are approaching it with different ways.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.380]   So it's far from settled, but it's important how they end up settling it.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.100]   Something that's going to have to go to the spring court.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.380]   I love the spring court.
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.380]   Mm hmm.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.380]   Doesn't.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:23.100]   Let's get back on the rails just just for a while.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:28.700]   A tangent to this is Michael Dell deciding that maybe he wants to take Dell back.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:34.380]   There's a story in Bloomberg about how Michael Dell would combine his 15.7% stake in Dell,
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:40.820]   along with $1 billion of his own personal funds and perhaps investment from, say, Microsoft
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:44.660]   in order to take control of Dell.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.140]   This is a very early on story.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.940]   It's a very speculative story.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.980]   Tim, I know you've been following this a little bit.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.980]   What would he do with it?
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:56.380]   If he were to take Dell back in a post PC world, what exactly would he do with?
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.420]   I mean, obviously that's that's the big question.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.620]   I mean, he, this is a great time to buy Dell.
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:04.100]   If you want to buy Dell, I mean, presumably the board of Dell is thinking, wow, things
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.620]   are not looking too good for this industry.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.420]   Maybe we should have an exit strategy and this could be their exit strategy.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.380]   But the question, yeah, what would Michael do with it?
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.380]   Because at this point, Dell has basically said we're not going to make a smartphone.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.380]   They tried and they didn't do very good there.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:19.700]   We haven't seen them really making a strong push under the Windows RT style tablet front,
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.700]   really?
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.140]   So they don't really have a strong direction when it comes to capitalizing on the shift
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.260]   toward tablets either.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:32.980]   So really they're a desktop, a laptop, enterprise consumer sort of mix of sales at this point.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:37.060]   And yeah, I don't see any strong direction to move into this mobile frontier we've been
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.180]   discussing for the past couple of minutes.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.180]   So that's a good question.
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:43.620]   I mean, presumably he would have to launch an amazing tablet and or some amazing smartphone
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.620]   and try to recapture some of their lost prestige.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.460]   I mean, it sounds like he's trying to buy it back and give the money back to the shareholders,
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:50.620]   ironically.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.900]   But it seems weird to invest a billion dollars of your own, a billion dollars plus because
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.900]   it's a billion dollars plus stock into something that's not a growth industry.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.060]   Doesn't it just make you want to know what backroom arguments are going on?
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:07.220]   What vision for the company is he not able to fulfill right now to where he needs to
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.820]   leverage billions of his own money in order to get it back?
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:15.420]   Didn't the dude get a Dell guy want to also help them rebrand and fix the company?
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.860]   So I guess they're taking all comers at this point.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.660]   But you know, I would much rather see what would happen if John McCaffey decided to take
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.660]   over that.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:27.660]   That would be amazing.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:31.220]   You think that goes to Steve Jobs is just cackling at this right now?
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:35.620]   Because if you remember, Michael Dell was the one who said that Apple should just dissolve
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.420]   and give the shareholders back the money.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.260]   Yeah, that's basically what he's doing.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.740]   I mean, he's not dissolving the company, but he's going to be he's buying it back.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:47.420]   He's essentially taking it semi-private so that he has control over its destiny.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:51.940]   Now, you know, there's a lot of backroom murmurs that are saying the only reason only way this
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.940]   makes sense is if he's he thinks that the fundamentals are still strong, that he still
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:00.380]   thinks that their prize are going to is going to buy PCs for the foreseeable future.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:05.740]   And he's concerned that the current setup of the company and the board is panicking.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:09.380]   But but still, I mean, that seems to be an awful lot of money to hedge against the panic.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.920]   Yeah, he's got to be thinking enterprise because there's really no direction that
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.100]   Dell can quickly move into right now without some major, major infusion of cash, which,
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.420]   you know, what we're talking about.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.260]   But even then it's going to take them years to really move to a point where they can be
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.980]   like Lenovo, releasing phones and tablets and laptops and everything else.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:28.820]   Yeah, it seems like it's an interesting move, but I mean, maybe they become like a white
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.660]   label brand for Microsoft or something like that.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:34.580]   Maybe they make the next surface, you know, who knows because that's an interesting thought
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.580]   because Microsoft is putting some money behind this.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:42.420]   And I think it's significant also that the argument that Dell is Michael Dell is making
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:47.540]   is that he needs the flexibility of not being publicly owned to compete and win in the marketplace.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.260]   True, true.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.780]   And it should be noted that at this point, Apple does have enough cash reserves to buy
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:57.220]   Dell, give the money back to the shareholders and wear it as a hat.
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.780]   It's pretty pretty.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.780]   Pretty pretty.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.020]   Pretty hat dude, you're getting a hat.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:10.980]   All right, but continuing with our post PC theme, we're talking about how 52 point sorry,
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:17.820]   52.5 million tablets were sold in quarter four versus 29.9 million in quarter four 2011.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:22.060]   That's 73 75.3% growth year over year.
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.260]   And it's incredibly healthy growth.
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:32.260]   Again, we won't see that in the years to come because the tablet market is slowly maturing,
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:37.420]   but there are some numbers out of the IDC that came in a next web article that point
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.460]   out that there are some clear trends in the industry.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:47.780]   First iPad share right now is 53.6% with 22.9 million units sold in quarter four 2011.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:54.420]   That was above five, sorry, in 2012 that's 50% above where they were last year.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.780]   Samsung has 15.1% of the market with 7.9 million sold.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.300]   That's a 263% growth year over year.
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:06.100]   Amazon is at 11.5% with 6 million units sold.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:11.260]   That's 15.9% with 4.7 million sold in quarter four, two thousand and four, two thousand and
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.260]   eleven.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:19.660]   That's 6.8% growth and Asus takes the fourth spot with 3.1 million units sold from 1.9%
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.700]   God, that was really hard to get there right now.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.700]   Bravo, Cheryl.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.180]   Bravo to eight numbers.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.740]   Numbers suck.
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:31.260]   But so what we're saying is there is a Apple is not quite as dominant in the tablet market,
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.860]   but I mean, you can't say that what was it?
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.420]   22.9 million units is disappointing, right?
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.660]   Yeah, Samsung kind of stepped up in the fourth quarter to take the lead in that sales quarter,
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.660]   but overall, looking at the year overall, Apple was definitely the dominant player.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.420]   So everybody had a really, really good year for sure.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.580]   And the big question now is what happens in 2013?
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.980]   Can they maintain this level of growth?
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.940]   I think it'll be pretty difficult to do personally.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.580]   You know who doesn't have a level of growth?
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:58.580]   Microsoft?
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:50:59.580]   Microsoft?
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:03.300]   So we've got Surface RT sales.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:07.500]   They're being really, really cagey about how they're phrasing it.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.020]   They're talking about channel sales.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:14.060]   They're saying that they sold 1.2 million units to the channel, which already doesn't sound
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:18.380]   great for a brand new product that was supposed to change the world, that they spent $1.6
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.500]   billion on advertising.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:26.300]   And the word is that only about half of that is actually making it out of the channels,
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.220]   only actually is making it into the hands of consumers.
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.180]   It's got a high return rate.
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.820]   There's no noticeable movement to restock right now.
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:37.340]   So it's not like Microsoft saying, oh, we sold so many of these that we need to get the
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:41.540]   orders out there in order to be able to replenish our supplies.
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.940]   Especially as we get into February, we're heading towards the Lunar New Year.
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.300]   This is where manufacturing in Asia shuts down.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:52.380]   And so typically, if you were going to have a bump, the orders would have been in in January.
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.380]   There are no orders from Microsoft.
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.380]   It's supposed to be fair.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.860]   It's the article notes.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.820]   I mean, the Kindle Fire HD had a similar situation.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:04.700]   They had, you know, un-purchased inventory going into the second quarter as well.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:05.700]   Right.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.700]   Right.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:07.700]   So actually, I don't know.
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:15.420]   The RT has always struck me as a problematic device because it almost promised a true Windows
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.420]   experience in a tablet form.
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:22.420]   But it just, it sounded like a half measure and half measures rarely do well.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:28.820]   When you got outside of the clock radio, virtually no middle mushy middle device has ever survived.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:32.580]   And meanwhile, like I'm actually genuinely excited about the full, what do they call it?
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.780]   The Surface Pro, which is a full PC in a form factor.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.140]   In fact, my mom, who, you know, is not very technical at all, she said, "You know what
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.140]   I want?
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.540]   I just want a really small, full computer that I could take with me.
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.540]   I have an iPad.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.540]   I don't take it with me.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.540]   I don't use it.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.540]   I just want something small like an iPad, but a full computer."
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.820]   I was like, "Well, guess what, mom?
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.980]   Wait a few weeks and you're in luck."
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.980]   I wonder if there's not an opportunity for a big surprise.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:58.100]   You know, I don't know how good it is because of course I haven't seen one.
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:03.740]   But as far as what the market, I suspect there might be a significant amount of untapped
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.060]   demand for a quote-unquote real.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.740]   For as much as we're talking about the post-PC era, I suspect that there are a lot of people
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.580]   who want a real PC in a tablet form.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:18.860]   But I'm guessing your mom means the RT, or at least what the RT can do because it does
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:23.300]   Microsoft Office, it does email, and it also has all the tablet stuff and it's keyboard
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.380]   and it does real multitasking on the desktop.
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:31.260]   So what the Pro is better at is like, "Okay, somebody who wants to download and install
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:36.060]   their own apps and actually run Windows and take full advantage of Windows."
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:40.780]   I think you head on it, Brian, the first part of what you're saying is Microsoft has a messaging
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:46.860]   problem because it would almost be better if it didn't have the desktop office part in
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:53.260]   RT and it was just competing directly with Apple and Android on being a tablet because
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.060]   it has a little bit of the desktop.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.900]   People start to get critical and say, "Well, I want the full desktop experience."
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.820]   You know what, Brian, I think what your mom really wants actually is for you to call her
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:02.820]   more often.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:09.580]   I'm going to go right over there and watch a supremely great game.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.660]   That's what she told me last night, anyway, yeah.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.660]   There we go.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.660]   Somebody has to get something in.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:15.660]   Bravo.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.660]   Bravo.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.500]   It's really weird when I picture my actual mom in that scenario.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:23.460]   Who might in fact be watching right now, Tom Merritt?
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.020]   Just FYI, there's that.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.020]   Hi, mama brushwood.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.020]   All right.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.420]   I just stopped by to say hi.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:31.660]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.820]   Web 981-9 wants to know if the service RT is heading out to the desert to be laid to
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.060]   rest next to the Blackberry Playbook and ET.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.340]   I don't think it's quite that bad.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.340]   Not yet.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:47.500]   I mean, so if you look back, I always like to liken it back to when Microsoft got into
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.500]   console gaming.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:52.740]   The original Xbox, everybody hated it when it came out, didn't sell particularly well,
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:53.740]   wasn't well received.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:56.580]   Everybody picked on it for being too big and too heavy and it wasn't what they wanted
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.300]   from a console gaming system.
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.660]   But then Microsoft learned a lot of lessons from that.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:05.660]   It came back to the 360 and it's now the dominant sales console in the US and in the world right
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:06.660]   now.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:12.060]   So they learned a lot there and presumably they could be on the same path.
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:13.620]   For surface, this was the first step.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:17.380]   I think we can all agree it wasn't exactly very successful for a step.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:20.220]   Certainly these sales figures tend to point in that direction.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.500]   But maybe this was the investment.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.820]   Maybe this is just putting their toe in the water to see what Rev 2 looks like.
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:29.740]   And I'm consuming or putting surface and surface pro together as the first step.
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.220]   Maybe generation two of the hardware will be significantly different and improved and
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.900]   everything that we want it to be.
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.660]   Yeah, is it Xbox or Zoom?
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:36.660]   That's kind of the big question.
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.380]   That's a very good question.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.740]   And remember the Xbox did not start off well?
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.220]   No, not well at all.
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:46.940]   I liked it because I have big hands and that giant football controller was perfect for
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.060]   me but everybody else, that's so much.
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.500]   I liked it because I hacked it and turned it into a media center.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.500]   But that's pretty much.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.780]   Yeah, that was the whole thing.
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:56:00.660]   Now let's actually go to revision 2.0 because we've got the Microsoft Surface Pro heading
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.220]   into users hands in just a while.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:07.020]   Now this is interesting because it really, I think again, you're right.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.700]   Microsoft has a messaging problem here because people think, oh, Surface Pro, it's just like
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.380]   the Surface RT, except a little bit better.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.540]   It's really an entirely different product.
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.540]   It's a laptop.
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:19.620]   It's a laptop without the keyboard built into it.
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:24.900]   And there's a kerfuffle right now because as the Verge reports, the Surface Pro is more
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.820]   like a laptop in that, yeah, when you have a laptop part of the storage is going to be
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:32.500]   used by the operating system and all the bloatware that you load onto it.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:36.540]   And so people are complaining already, even though it hasn't hit stores, that the 64
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:41.100]   gigabyte version will only have 23 gigabytes of usable storage.
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.020]   Half of that's used by the operating system.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:46.980]   A large part of it is used by a recovery partition that you can delete.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:48.180]   But people are saying, wait a minute.
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:52.300]   If I buy a 32 gigabyte iPad, I get 32 gigabytes.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.140]   Why isn't the Surface Pro the same?
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:59.060]   And even if you compare it to the MacBook Air, the 11-inch or the 64 gig MacBook Air, you
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.420]   lose about 20 gigs for system storage there.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.180]   So you still get about 40 gigs of available space here with the 64 gig Pro.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:08.500]   You'll get 23 gigs available space, which is pretty poor.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.740]   Why Microsoft didn't opt to put that recovery partition on a thumb drive or something like
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:15.300]   that to give you the option to, if you need to use it, it's there separately.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.300]   I don't know.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:20.500]   I think it's about 46 gigs for the 128 gig version.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.620]   I think it's 41 gigs, something like that for the 64 gig version.
[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:28.380]   That is a significant chunk of space that you are giving up right out of the box.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.980]   And that's a huge amount.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:34.260]   Even for the average consumer who doesn't really think about things like partitions and the
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:39.580]   amount of space that the apps that come built in are taking up, that's going to be noticeable
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:40.580]   for them.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.420]   I think it's enough of a number that it's going to be noticeable for the average user.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.300]   And that's going to be a major problem for them.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:51.140]   Okay, so this average user though, is this an animal that we encounter as much nowadays
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:52.820]   as we did say 10 years ago?
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:58.340]   It just seems to me that the internet has made possible this dissemination of information
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:01.980]   where I feel like maybe I'm totally wrong in this, but I feel like most consumers are
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.580]   much more educated and they know what they're getting into.
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:09.140]   I mean, maybe in the early 90s, the marketing message held a lot of sway because that was
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.220]   your only point of data.
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:14.140]   But nowadays, we all know, we all check Yelp ratings before we go out.
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:17.420]   We all check reviews before we buy products.
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:23.340]   And I feel like if it's a problem, that there's only 20 gigs or whatever free, then people
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.180]   will know it and word will get out.
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.340]   Well, what about a proportion?
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:29.460]   Yeah, I've got my mom.
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.940]   Always with your mom jokes now.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:34.340]   No, but honestly, I think it will.
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:39.100]   I think it still is an issue because, I mean, it annoys me and I wouldn't exactly call myself
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:42.860]   like a typical consumer, but I think it's enough of a difference if you have to jump
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:47.260]   through hoops to get more storage, the storage that you rightfully deserve, then I think
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.860]   that's going to be an issue.
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:53.820]   And if Microsoft had put the recovery partition on a USB drive, which you can do yourself,
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:58.860]   you can put it on a USB drive and take back some of that space, everyone would have complained
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.740]   like, why is the recovery partition on a separate drive?
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:04.020]   And that drives up the cost of the machine.
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.980]   So they're kind of stuck in a no-win situation here.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:13.820]   It's just a, I don't know, maybe Windows 8 is just too darn big in the way they designed
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:14.820]   it to work on a tablet.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.340]   I think I have a solution.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:18.700]   They should have put an optical drive in the tablet.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.100]   Give it you a DVD with the operating system on there.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.700]   I think that's the way to go.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:29.100]   They could take all those old HD DVD externals that they never sold to the Xbox, make those
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:31.100]   work with a happy backup.
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.260]   What they should have done.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:38.460]   >> Well, and I'm sorry real quick, it does seem like they could have, if they sense this
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.860]   would be a PR problem when they shipped.
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:45.940]   It seems like they could have done something like offer a $20, $50 upgrade where it's like
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:51.740]   and if you'd like, it ships with the backup copy of the OS already removed and on this
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.780]   thumb drive for you to keep or whatever.
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:58.500]   It seems like this problem or this perception is blindsided them, which would not be the
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:03.660]   weirdest thing for Microsoft to encounter that they weren't ready for a public blowback
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.980]   about something.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.260]   What they really need to do is they need to develop an operating system that's lightweight,
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:13.460]   that's sort of Windows 8, but much reduced in functionality and they could call it Windows
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.460]   8 CE.
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.820]   >> Embedded edition.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:19.540]   >> Embedded edition.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.380]   >> You know, that's enough of that.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.700]   I really had enough of the Surface and the Surface Pro because I've got Leo over here
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.820]   and again, he's, I think he's coming in from the Super Bowl.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.820]   He wants to do another ad.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.420]   So Chad, if we could go to the big guy and find out what he wants to share.
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.420]   >> I think I hear him.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.140]   >> Excuse me, pardon me.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.140]   Leo LePorte here.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:43.620]   I know I'm not supposed to be here and this is in no way an indictment of the great job
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.820]   you're doing, Father Robert and Tom, Veronica, so nice to see you.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.020]   How come you never come in when I'm around?
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:57.540]   >> I do have to mention one of our fine sponsors and because I use it every single day, they
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:00.460]   thought it'd be great if I told you about sharefile.com.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:05.900]   This is a Citrix product and it is the simply put the best way to share files in business.
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.580]   You all know the problem.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.700]   You want to share file first instinct, attach it to email, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong,
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.540]   because anything, you know, there's still people with 10 megabyte email inboxes.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.940]   Am I right?
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:23.580]   So you're going to send even one image from my Canon camera is 21 megabytes.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.020]   I can't even -- and it's also bad form to attach files.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.420]   It wastes bandwidth.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.420]   It's frankly not secure.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.580]   It's not a good thing to do.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.660]   So this is what I recommend.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.860]   Sharefile.com, more than recommend, is what I use.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:38.660]   I, for instance, I had to record a bunch of the radio show ahead of time because I wasn't
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:40.740]   going to be there today.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:41.740]   What did I do?
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:45.460]   I put it on in a folder, a designated folder on my hard drive.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.700]   So I'll synced it automatically to a shared folder.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.620]   Now I already gave permission for the radio stations to access it, but if I hadn't, it's
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.580]   very simple to send them an email and says here's the file.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.420]   There's an outlook attachment.
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.420]   You're not giving them a file.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.860]   You're giving a link, right?
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.540]   Sharefile stores that.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.540]   It's encrypted.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.100]   No one can get HTTP/BS.
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.460]   No one can get access to it.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.740]   And you fully control the file.
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.420]   You can say who can download it, how long they can have it, how many times they can download
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.620]   it, when they can download it.
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:17.540]   You get an email if you want notification that they have downloaded it.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.180]   I have tried other file sharing systems.
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:22.460]   And frankly, it didn't work, especially some of the radio stations.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.940]   They were confused by it.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:24.940]   With Sharefile, it's very simple.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.940]   They see my logo.
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.740]   By the way, it's a beautifully designed logo page.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.420]   They have a link to click.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.940]   If it's a folder, they can download the whole file, zip, the whole folder, zipped, or they
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.260]   can go into the folder and look at it.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.340]   It couldn't be simpler.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.340]   Very professional.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.260]   It's worked really well for me.
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.260]   And I want you to try it.
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:45.380]   You are sending drawings, attachments of any kind.
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.700]   If you're sharing files with clients, if you're sharing files with colleagues, Sharefiles
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:49.700]   are a great solution.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.700]   By the way, it's also cloud storage.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.380]   They don't talk about this as much.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.340]   But it's just like any other cloud storage solution with your Sharefile account, those
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.060]   files are synced automatically.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.060]   You can see them anytime.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.660]   You can log onto your Sharefile account on any computer.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:06.620]   You could synchronize onto another computer if you want with their Windows and Mac synchronizing
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.940]   background synchronizers.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.700]   You can even access it from a smartphone.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:10.700]   And there's your stuff.
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.540]   So it's cloud storage plus the best way to share files.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.620]   30 days free.
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:16.460]   You can try it right now.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.300]   I recommend you do.
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.940]   If you go to sharefile.com and use our offer code TWIT.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.420]   Sharefiles-- you at the top, it says radio listeners click here.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.980]   That's the way to do it.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.380]   Because then you can start your three 30-day trial.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.540]   Just make sure you use the offer code TWIT if you would, so they know where you heard
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.660]   about it.
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.300]   And I thank you for your support.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.500]   I thank them for their support.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.500]   And now we continue with this week in tech.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:39.780]   Sorry.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.740]   You couldn't be here, guys.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.580]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.660]   You're here in spirit.
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:49.580]   Speaking of the spirit of things, we've got the spirit of the Grinch going on in Europe
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:50.100]   right now.
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:56.220]   I don't know if you guys have heard this, this article from Macworld where Apple is discontinuing
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.380]   the Mac Pro, at least in Europe.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:03.780]   The reason for this is that there is a new safety legislation that has passed that would
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:08.420]   require Apple to shroud all the fans inside the computer.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:13.580]   Now, I'll picture that, the fans inside the case need to be shrouded from people who might
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.740]   be stupid enough to open it and stick something into the fan.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.580]   So I don't really understand why.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:22.180]   But Apple is basically saying, look, we're not going to make this change to the lineup,
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:25.300]   just to meet up with this Tikki-Taki legislation.
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:29.860]   You've got until February 18 to order a new Mac Pro if you are in one of the affected European
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:30.860]   countries.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.500]   And then it will be delivered by March 1, which is the cutoff date.
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.740]   So a lot of people are saying, look, this is just because of the legislation.
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:44.620]   But there are some other voices that are looking at this as the next step in a gradual removal
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.100]   of the Mac Pro line.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.020]   We haven't seen that much of an update over the last couple of years, basically nothing
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.300]   major since 2010.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:56.460]   And so little of their profit is actually derived from the desktops that it almost makes sense
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.300]   for Apple to say, this is not worth our time.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:03.620]   Now, open question to the panel, is that something Apple can afford to do?
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:09.740]   I mean, again, tying back into the post-PC story, if the desktop is becoming less important,
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:13.980]   can Apple now say, look, if you want a Mac, just get a laptop, it'll be the same thing?
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.060]   We've actually been waiting for them to make some kind of a--
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:18.820]   Oh, no, no.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:22.380]   To make some kind of an-- either to completely redesign the thing or to basically discontinue
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.380]   it.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.220]   And they did, of course, just make the announcement that they're going to be bringing Mac production
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:28.700]   to the US for an unknown brand of Mac.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:32.780]   And we presume it would be this one because the cost would be so much lower for bringing
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:34.020]   any other Mac production here.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:38.380]   But yeah, I mean, that's largely standard componentry in that device versus the iMac
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.820]   and the other things that are much more bespoke and so they can charge more for it and have
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.460]   a higher premium for it.
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.700]   So yeah, if they were going to kill something that's making them less money, that'd be
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.700]   the way to do it.
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.860]   And if they wanted to, you know, probably wouldn't cost them more than a couple of bucks
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:52.300]   to actually update the thing, to put in the shroud to keep little Timmy from getting his
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.100]   fingers cut off when he tries to take the back of the case off.
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.100]   I don't know.
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:02.740]   It seems like a very Apple way to enact legislation to affect the level of the market.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:07.540]   And then the laws overseas, especially, let's say it's one of their less profitable items.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.860]   The problem is what Apple really sells is an ecosystem.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:13.460]   And when you sell an ecosystem, you have to sell the whole ecosystem.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:18.020]   So I don't, I would be shocked if this is part of their plate actually shut down this
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:22.460]   whole division, but it does seem like a very Apple thing for them to stuff it in the face
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.620]   of some BS legislation that they don't approve of.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.620]   I think that makes me sad.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:32.700]   It would make me sad if they did because it's really their last like upgradable device
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:33.700]   at this point.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:37.900]   I mean, it's one of the last ones you can actually really open up and upgrade at your
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.900]   own will.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.420]   So that would, that would make me sad.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:47.300]   Back in June, Connie Guglielmo told nine to five Mac that new designs of the Mac Pro
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.300]   are in the works and will likely be released in 2013.
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:55.140]   David Pogue was told by an executive that new models and new designs were underway.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:07:00.940]   Tim Cook emailed a reader and said, we didn't have a chance to talk about a new Mac Pro today,
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:04.660]   talking about WWDC last year, but don't worry, we're working on something really great for
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.660]   later next year.
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:09.500]   So I don't know what else Apple can do to like rest the fears that they're going to
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.620]   get rid of the Mac Pro except for come out with a new Mac Pro.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.820]   And what it looks to me, what happened in Europe is they're not ready to release the
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.420]   new design yet.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:22.260]   And the current Mac Pros don't conform to European law.
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:25.580]   So they've got to pull them off the shelves until they come out with the new Mac Pro.
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:28.540]   My guess is by the end of 2013, they'll be new Mac Pros.
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:29.540]   They'll have the shroud.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.620]   They'll go on sale in Europe.
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.620]   But what about that?
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:39.180]   I mean, if you look at the Mac rumors reporting on the quarter sales, the Q4 2012, Mac Pro
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.580]   sales are flat.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.460]   And that's just in revenue in profits.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.100]   It's actually infinitesimal.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:50.020]   Someone told me it's something like 1%, maybe even below 1% of the total profits that Apple
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.020]   gets.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:55.420]   They get far more off of the iPhone and even the iPad than anything else.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:08:01.220]   I mean, the iOS devices essentially account for something like 90% of Apple's profits.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:05.180]   Well, it would kind of make sense for them to focus on the things that make them profit,
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.180]   right?
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:11.100]   And I know the ecosystem argument, but you could argue that the ecosystem is the laptop,
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:17.140]   a MacBook Pro, a properly configured MacBook Pro, 17-inch with a retina display, will get
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:21.700]   you within a hair of the performance that most people would expect out of a desktop.
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.940]   I just don't believe it because who are the people that made Apple?
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:29.580]   The people who for 15 years, 20 years now, it's been the artsy types, it's been the graphic
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:33.660]   desktop designers, it's been the video editors, and to turn your back on those people would
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:34.660]   be insane.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:35.660]   I just don't see it.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.460]   I think it would definitely upset that community as well.
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.980]   I totally agree.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:44.180]   And the sales are flat because they haven't significantly updated it and so long.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.860]   So it isn't as compelling as it used to be.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:52.540]   We'll see if they do follow up on these promises from last summer and come out with new Mac
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.740]   Pros by the end of 2013.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.260]   Maybe those profit margins are a little better.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.380]   Maybe they've figured out how to make more money off of them.
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:02.580]   Yeah, maybe it's just, it also could be a very saturated market at this point for people
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.700]   who are using a Mac Pro because you've got a certain number of people who are doing that
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.420]   kind of work that requires that amount of power.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:14.140]   People who are buying laptops, it runs the gamut of all different sorts of people.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.260]   So I don't know, maybe that's why we've seen flat numbers in recent years.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.900]   They're just waiting for the next device to upgrade to.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:24.660]   No, well, and then maybe, you know, maybe, you know, dusting up some stuff in the meantime.
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:29.220]   I mean, I can again, if they're already pausing anyway to take a breath and do the next release,
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:32.460]   why not go ahead and be all like, screw you lawmakers.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.740]   But it's not screw you lawmakers.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.980]   It's the law went into effect and the product doesn't comply to it.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:37.980]   They can't sell it.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:41.420]   Who are these people sticking their fingers into computer fans?
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.420]   I've done that.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.420]   I've done that.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   You've done that.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.420]   You've done that.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   I have done that.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:48.420]   It's like, you know, my career is getting hot.
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.420]   Let me see if the fan is still working.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.420]   That's cool.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.420]   Yes, it's still working.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.420]   I've been there.
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.500]   It's those famous long-fingered Germans.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.700]   I do it just to see if I still feel.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:01.660]   Now we're going to a very different place altogether.
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:02.660]   It's gotten dark.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:03.660]   It just got dark.
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:09.020]   But you know, okay, look, Apple is not known for bending to, you know, suit itself to
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.140]   every little legislative change and every consumer demand.
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:15.780]   But you know what company does bend over backwards to give the consumers exactly what
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:16.780]   they want.
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.780]   What company is that?
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.780]   Facebook.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.780]   It's true.
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:20.780]   Not really.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:24.220]   But we do have an article here about how Facebook beat the estimates.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.220]   Woo!
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.220]   Money exchange.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:32.280]   Revenue was up 40% year over year up to 1.59 billion, whereas we like to call it 1.5
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.660]   Instagrams.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:41.660]   That means that they're also accounting for 1.6, 1.06 billion monthly active users, 618
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:49.780]   million daily active users, and more importantly, 680 million monthly active users on mobile.
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:54.740]   Now the understory here reported on by the Verge is that mobile activity has now passed
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:59.780]   desktop activity on Facebook, which is actually not as big of a blessing as it may sound like
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:05.860]   because anyone who's sold ads knows that, well, mobile makes you a lot less money than
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.380]   a desktop ad.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:12.540]   In fact, in some instances it can make something like 10% of what you would make if that ad
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.940]   had actually displayed on a desktop.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:20.100]   So we're in this weird, weird realm where Facebook is continuing to increase the number
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:24.700]   of users they have, but just to maintain revenue.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:30.740]   In other words, for every mobile desktop user you lose, you have to add 10 mobile users
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:33.020]   just to stay flat on revenue.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.460]   And of course, they don't need to stay flat.
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:35.540]   They need to grow it.
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:40.700]   So my question to the panel is looking at these numbers, looking at Facebook's revenue,
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:45.300]   looking at them, hoping to beat estimates into the next quarter, what do they have to
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:50.340]   do in order to increase the number of mobile users and desktop users?
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:55.060]   Why don't they need to increase the number of desktop users?
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:58.740]   And the reason I say that is not because you're wrong about the current state of ad
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:02.140]   revenue, but the money is going towards mobile.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:05.420]   And that's why everyone is thinking, you know what, Facebook better get onto mobile
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:10.860]   because if they're behind the game, they're going to lose out when people move to mobile.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.700]   Everybody knows usage is going to mobile.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:13.700]   You can't change that.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.100]   You can't stop user behavior.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.460]   What you need to do is lean into it.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:21.500]   And what Facebook's doing to my mind is very smart, which is making sure that they're gussying
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:26.580]   up their actual mobile applications so they're usable, which they weren't for a while.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:30.740]   And now the next step is to come up with compelling device, compelling apps that make people
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.660]   want to use Facebook more, which gives them more of an opportunity to sell ads.
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:39.060]   I think the amount of money you can make off mobile is going to rise, just like the amount
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:44.340]   of money you can make off the internet, off of websites, has risen over time.
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:48.500]   This is kind of a normal pattern for new ways of getting advertising.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:53.340]   It's always a lower money game at the beginning until you get that critical mass moving over
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.340]   there.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.180]   And they also are looking into new ways of making money.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.940]   We've seen them launching the ability to buy actual presents on Facebook now.
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.740]   And we've seen some other developments like that where it's clear that they're trying
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:07.620]   to find new ways of generating revenue beyond simple insertions of ads and highlighted posts
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.340]   and sponsored posts and things like that.
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:10.460]   I think they'll continue to do that.
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:12.940]   And I think that that's something that we'll be seeing a lot of different websites doing
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:16.580]   throughout the course of this year next year, because Facebook isn't the only one suffering
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:17.580]   from this problem.
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.660]   We certainly see the same trend on our end as well.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:24.300]   And if you are a website that's heavily dependent on desktop revenue, if you don't have a plan
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.260]   for this, you're in trouble.
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:28.980]   Actually, Tim, let me ask you that because you might have some unique insight.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:34.780]   And that is, why is it that a mobile eyeball is worth so much less than a desktop eyeball?
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.620]   It's not so much that an eyeball is worth less than one thing.
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.620]   There's less space.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.700]   You know, you can put three or four banner ads on a page on a desktop.
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.220]   You can't necessarily do that on a mobile page without making completely obtrusive and
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.220]   ugly.
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.340]   So, you know, you go from maybe three or four banner spaces to only one banner space.
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:52.260]   And then the engagement is much, much lower on mobile and general as well.
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.860]   You know, you can click and open a tab on a desktop and kind of forget about it.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.180]   So people are more likely to click.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.700]   But if you tap on something, it kind of takes over your mobile experience.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.700]   And so people are much more.
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:05.060]   Think about also, Tim, the fact that where do you make your purchases?
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:09.420]   When you buy stuff from Amazon, think about how often you do it at a desktop versus on
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:10.660]   a mobile device.
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:14.420]   So if you're, if the goal of advertisement is to get people to buy stuff, then structurally,
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.660]   there are deep problems with, with the mobile.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:21.700]   Now they can win if what they're doing is, you know, investing in a lot of R&D to make
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:27.820]   the mobile ads exquisitely targeted for very specific, you know, like granted, you only
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:32.780]   get one banner ad instead of three, but it is precisely exactly what you want.
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:37.140]   You have, you know, the fewest number clicks possible between the claim that they have
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.860]   a solution for you and you actually placing that order.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.380]   I think they can win with that.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.740]   And I think this is, I think you're right.
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:46.060]   This is the time to be investing in the, in the infrastructure to make that possible on
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.060]   mobile.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.540]   It certainly can't get much worse whenever I'm shopping for something and I'll buy that
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:53.980]   at something and then I'll see banner ads for that something for the next month on Facebook.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:54.980]   Oh my God.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:55.980]   I already knew.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.980]   After the fact.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:00.700]   In the worst cases when I donate to the ASPCA, I see sad puppies on Facebook for weeks.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.940]   And it's the worst thing ever.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.140]   It's like, I don't want to give money to the ASPCA because then I see sad puppies on Facebook
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:06.140]   for a month.
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:07.140]   Negative reinforcement.
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:08.140]   I like this.
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:12.300]   There's so much stuff on Amazon for, for textile episodes and then for, for months afterwards,
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.620]   I'm like, I just don't need that many UPS's.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.620]   I just don't.
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:21.300]   A lot of ads for, for, for, on a drug, a little power supplies.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:24.020]   Anyway, can I have too many though?
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:30.540]   No, well, speaking of Facebook guiding us to buying things, have you all heard about Facebook's
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:33.540]   new gift card?
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:36.300]   So let me, let me run down the specs on this.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:41.020]   You buy it on Facebook in the gift store, but you can't use it in the gift store.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:43.220]   It can actually only be used at four retailers.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:49.140]   Sephora, which I just found out is cosmetics, Target, Jamba Juice and Olive Garden.
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.380]   It's a good mix.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.740]   It sounds like a, it sounds like a good time of them all.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.540]   It's a eclectic mix, yes.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.340]   Now, a lot of people are sort of scratching their head at this.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.460]   I think we know where Facebook wants to go.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:03.940]   I mean, they would like a piece of the financial pie that they're, they're pushing people
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:04.940]   to.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:05.940]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.020]   But this seems like a really, really block-handed way to do it.
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.020]   It's a stretch.
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.020]   It's definitely a stretch.
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:12.460]   I, I think the idea of selling someone a birthday present through Facebook is actually
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:13.460]   pretty smart.
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.780]   I mean, when you send somebody, you know, as you say, happy birthday, it says, "Hey, would
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:16.780]   you like to send them an actual gift?"
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.780]   I think that makes sense.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.540]   But yes, a gift card, not so much.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.540]   Right.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.180]   This is, this is the next level, right?
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:26.860]   Because if you're reminding someone that so and so has a birthday, it'll also say, "Oh,
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:30.300]   by the way, these people like this, this, this, and this, maybe you want to send them
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.300]   a gift."
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.180]   They've got the data in there and they might as well use the graph search for something.
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.420]   Oh, and they will.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:36.980]   Oh, they will.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:40.820]   So open question of the panel, are any of you intending to get a Facebook gift card?
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:42.820]   You know it's no.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:43.820]   What is this?
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:44.820]   Troll bait?
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:45.820]   What?
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:48.300]   I'm taking your stinky bait, Father.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.300]   You remember who I am?
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.300]   I am the troll.
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.540]   I do troll to it.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.540]   That's my job.
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:56.940]   Now, but I mean, really, who's going to buy this?
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.780]   You know what?
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.620]   Sometimes businesses do things because you got to find out what works and what doesn't
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.620]   work.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:07.180]   And without even having, I mean, it's shocking how many business decisions get made because
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:10.940]   something sounded good in a brainstorming session once and inertia takes it all the
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:11.940]   way through it.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:15.740]   It could be that the value of this to Facebook is just to figure out, you know what?
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:20.140]   People expect gift cards to have a specific value for a specific thing.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:21.140]   We learn something today.
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.780]   And if that's the case, then good on you Facebook.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:24.780]   Congratulations.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:25.780]   And you know what?
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:26.780]   Learning is half the battle.
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:27.780]   Sure.
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:28.780]   All right.
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.780]   Let's go to a juicier story.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:30.780]   We've got Judge Lucy Ko.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:31.780]   Everyone remember her?
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.420]   She's everyone's favorite Korean judge in San Jose who ruled that Samsung.
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.420]   Wow.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.420]   Did you say that?
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.420]   You did.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.420]   You sure did.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:40.420]   That was an out loud thought, right?
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.420]   Dang.
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.420]   Okay.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.860]   She ruled that Samsung did not willingly infringe Apple patents.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:51.060]   This was on top of Apple going back to her last year and saying that they wanted damages.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:55.300]   They wanted to triple the damages on the award because of course Samsung knew that these
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:59.340]   patents were were there and that they had infringed them.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:05.780]   Essentially her ruling was that Samsung reasonably expected the patents to be overturned, to be
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:06.780]   invalidated.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:13.060]   And so therefore, since they expected them to be invalidated, they could not be held
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.700]   liable of what is it?
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.300]   Willful infringement.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:20.620]   This means that while Samsung is still on the hook for the $1 billion judgments against
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:22.700]   them, those damages cannot be tripled.
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:27.780]   And furthermore, this is on top of several key Apple patents being overturned and invalidated
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:29.220]   by the USPTO.
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:33.260]   The biggest one being the rubber banding patent that was part of the trade dress.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.220]   Everyone calls it patent 381.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:40.820]   That was the single patent that was applied across Samsung's line and that jurors voted
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.540]   on as the largest component of the damage.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:47.540]   So my question is, and again, this is this is a question we've heard a couple of times,
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.620]   what does this do for for the damages?
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:52.500]   Obviously, they're going to get reduced.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:56.300]   If I've patent 381 is no longer invalid, is no longer valid.
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:01.500]   And if Samsung does not have to pay those damages, we're talking about half of the judgment.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:07.020]   And if it goes further and says that Samsung did not willingly infringe in fringe Apple
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:12.620]   patents, it helps Samsung in their appeal of the decision, does it not?
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:17.260]   Yeah, but then Apple can still appeal this ruling as well, I think.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:20.380]   I think I can just go back and forth indefinitely, right?
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.380]   True.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.820]   I don't know how the law works.
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:30.500]   Yeah, I actually spoke to Evan Brown about this and he listened to him about 10 minutes
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.100]   and then my brain exploded.
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:37.340]   But he also mentioned that our USPTO has a very interesting component to it where the
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:41.180]   company applying for the patent or the individual applying for the patent is actually responsible
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:45.380]   for doing the due diligence to make sure that the patent will be valid.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:52.580]   So if that's true, Apple can be held liable for Samsung's court costs to defend themselves
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:55.580]   against the invalid patent 318.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:56.860]   Nothing.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:01.140]   That sounded like law talk if I'm not mistaken.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:04.140]   And I don't hear Texas, we don't cotton to law talkers.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:07.220]   Is that why you call them in Texas?
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:08.220]   Law talkers.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.220]   Law talkers.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.780]   You're on a I'm a simple law talker.
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:16.380]   I'm afraid that I get out of the stand, yo patent laws.
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:20.220]   Look, man, I'll tell you what, my gut tells me and I know nothing.
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:23.460]   Reminder, spoiler alert, I'm an idiot who eats fire for a living.
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:28.660]   But I don't know that it's the craziest defense I've ever heard, the idea that somebody could
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:33.820]   say, yes, it was illegal while we were doing it, but we thought it wouldn't be illegal by
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:35.380]   the time we got it done.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.740]   Like that sounds crazy.
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:42.020]   But I, to be honest, I've accelerated an anticipation of a speed limit increase and sometimes that
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.220]   speed limit increase wasn't there.
[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:48.540]   And then, but in my heart, I wasn't breaking the law on purpose.
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.140]   I thought I was getting ready to obey the new law.
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:52.140]   All right.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.140]   Okay.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:21:00.820]   Speaking of the new law, you know, we often find ourselves in need of entertainment to
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:03.500]   divert ourselves from this apple Samsung thing.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.220]   This was an absolutely horrible transition.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.220]   This one died.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:09.900]   I had something I really did and I never.
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:10.900]   I never.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.620]   I had to say that the reason I didn't have anything to say about the patent cases because
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:15.900]   I was busy listening to a book from audible.com.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.100]   See, I knew it.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.100]   I had that.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:21.020]   That was so that was in the corner of my brain and it just would not come out.
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.020]   It's been brought.
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:26.540]   I'll talk to Tom on the phone and I'll bring something up and he won't answer and he'll
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:27.660]   say, oh, I'm sorry, Brian.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:31.100]   I was just enjoying some of the thousands of awesome titles on audible.com.
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.100]   I'm able to listen to it.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:37.860]   100,000 down the walk in tight now across all types of devices, including fiction, nonfiction
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:38.860]   periodicals.
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:39.860]   We are missing out.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:41.860]   We are so missing out.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.580]   You know, you're not missing out because if you're in that this we can tech audience,
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:51.380]   which which Tim, you actually are, you can get two audio books to give audible a try.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:57.020]   We're giving Twit listeners the platinum plan on trial, two free audio books to try it
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:59.140]   out, two book credits a month.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:02.340]   That means some of those, some of those really big books that are two credits, you can get
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.340]   those for free.
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:08.780]   You don't want to talk about the name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss, who I believe
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:11.340]   was on your podcast, Sordin Laser recently.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.340]   Yes.
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.340]   You know what?
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.540]   Yeah, you could get, you could get the name of the wind.
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:17.740]   What would be another good one to go along with the name of the wind, Veronica?
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:23.180]   I think a great pick would be Old Man's War by John Scalzi, also a recent Sordin Laser
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:24.180]   pick.
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:26.140]   An excellent pick I might add.
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:28.140]   And Red by Will Wheaton.
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.140]   Is it not?
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:30.140]   It is not.
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:31.140]   No, it's not.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:32.140]   I was thinking about Red Church.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:33.140]   You're doing so good job.
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:34.140]   You're doing really good.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.140]   There you go.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:42.540]   And Not Red by Will Wheaton, which I don't know, maybe that's a positive for somebody.
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:45.180]   It's a great deal for people who enjoy listening to audio programming.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.220]   I get a lot done.
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:50.660]   I'm listening to Red Country by Joe Abercrombie right now and it's helping me get things
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:56.060]   organized around the house for more details to get those two free audiobooks and the platinum
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:59.780]   offer, which includes a free subscription to the audio versions of the Wall Street Journal
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:00.780]   and New York Times.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:03.380]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:10.980]   That's TWIT and the number two audible.com/twit2 available in the US and Canada.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:17.540]   And we definitely thank audible for their support of all kinds of things we do, especially
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:19.540]   this weekend tech.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.980]   Oh, oh wait, for a second, I was sure that you said tech used because you do that on
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:24.980]   frame rate all the time.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:27.700]   You accidentally checked on state tech yesterday.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.620]   Oh, the truth comes out.
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:34.420]   Oh my goodness.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.420]   It's funny.
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:36.420]   It is.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:37.420]   Okay.
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:40.020]   You know what's not funny?
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.020]   It's not funny.
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.580]   Netflix getting creative.
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:45.820]   Now I know that you've covered this on frame rate, so I'm going to lean on the two of you
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.820]   heavily.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:51.540]   Netflix $100 million bet on House of Cards.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.900]   Now this is an interesting story for many reasons.
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:57.020]   So first of all, because it seems to be a very interesting show.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:58.340]   You've got Kevin Spacey.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.420]   You've got a well-funded production, high production values.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:08.100]   It's a show on the internet, yes, but at the same time, there's a lot of rustling about
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:14.020]   this being the future of content that this model could redefine how we look at shows in
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.020]   the future.
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:20.180]   We've got Netflix CTO, the chief content officer, looking at a $300 million budget for
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.180]   original programming.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.740]   He wants five shows a year.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:30.420]   And his quote is, "The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO for Netflix to become HBO
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:32.940]   faster than HBO can become Netflix."
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.140]   Now, I 100% believe this.
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:36.140]   This will happen.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:37.140]   I guarantee it.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:38.140]   It's not like you had something else.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.140]   What was that?
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.420]   Well, what I like about this is it's a new way of dealing with content.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:46.060]   So in the typical development cycle that you would get on a network, you would create
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:47.060]   a pilot.
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:49.060]   The pilot would go out, they'd see how well it does.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:50.220]   How many people watched it?
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.980]   What was the audience response?
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.580]   Are advertisers willing to buy it?
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:59.580]   And that is why sometimes you'll have a pilot that does really well that dies because it
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:03.580]   may be popular with the audience, but if no one's willing to pay for advertising, it
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.940]   dies in the crib.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:08.340]   Netflix's new scheme works like this.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:13.540]   You make a show, a single first episode to determine if the concept is valid.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:14.780]   Will people watch it?
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:16.220]   Is it watchable?
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:20.540]   If that is, that's the only question you have to go with, you make the whole season because
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.140]   Netflix realizes their delivery system is not the same as the networks.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:27.100]   They are not bound by the time schedule.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.420]   In other words, to run one program, it does not mean you have to remove another.
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.100]   With the internet, all they need is content.
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.380]   They put the content there.
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:37.660]   People will watch it and they get paid in subscriptions.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:41.100]   It's a totally different way of thinking about what we watch.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:45.500]   We are all really bingers at the end of the day when it comes to this kind of stuff.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:49.460]   If I find a show that I like to watch on Netflix or on Hulu or something like that, as long
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:52.500]   as I will just watch the entire thing in one go.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.340]   I think this really speaks to that model being successful going forward because I feel
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:00.460]   like that's a lot of the reason that people are so into watching internet content and into
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:05.180]   watching stuff that's on Netflix because you have that accessibility to the entire catalog
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:06.180]   right away.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:09.820]   Now, I got to be honest, Father Robert, that I had not even considered.
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:14.940]   I mean, I think what you just came across as an extremely important and significant idea,
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:19.420]   the idea that the types of stories that can be told now are fundamentally different because
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:22.500]   for the first time, they are not catering to advertisers.
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.660]   They're catering to the people who buy it.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:29.060]   Imagine if all your favorite books were not written just for what they thought the reader
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.860]   would like to hear.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:36.420]   But instead, we're written what do advertisers think would be a good book that they want
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:37.620]   to put their money behind.
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:42.220]   And taking that out of the equation makes possible a totally different form of storytelling.
[01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:48.540]   And that's why my co-host on NSFW, Justin Robert Young and I have argued on screen for
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:54.060]   hours at a time, he's under the impression that Netflix should be releasing these episodes
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:59.140]   weekly so that they can maximize their relevance culturally, like every week, every Monday,
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.900]   you talk about the latest episode of such and such.
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:07.660]   But now that House of Cards is out, dude, that model is dead and stupid and buried and
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.620]   I want it gone forever.
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:13.780]   What they're doing is brilliant because even if they were releasing a week over week, I
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:18.220]   would just wait three more weeks until they'd run their course so then I could watch them
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.100]   all straight through at once.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:25.460]   Being a story with a deep, fascinating narrative like House of Cards watching it straight through
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:28.980]   and I'm only like six episodes in is phenomenal.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:35.060]   And there's so many, it's as good as any narrative I've seen on HBO.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:40.100]   I think the last time I felt this way about a series was the, maybe not the wire, but
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:42.100]   the shield.
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.580]   I love what they're doing with this thing directed by David Fincher.
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:51.140]   It's amazing and the fact that they're releasing it all at once is they're taking narratives,
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:57.780]   long form episodic narratives and releasing them and treating them more like 13 to 18 hour
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:01.140]   long single narrative arcs is amazing.
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:03.300]   I think it was a brilliant, brilliant move on their part.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:06.300]   There's a lot of interesting things about what's going on here and you can make arguments
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:10.700]   about whether HBO was doing what Netflix was doing for a long time and that they would
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:16.260]   make quality programming without having to be beholden to advertisers, but they still
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:17.420]   followed the clock.
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:22.620]   They still required their shows to fit in that 60 minute time slot or 30 minute time slot
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:24.780]   because they had a schedule to keep.
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:25.860]   Netflix doesn't have a schedule.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:29.820]   So one of the more interesting things about House of Cards I feel like is that each episode
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:33.980]   is a different length because they were allowed to just make the episode as long as they felt
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:36.220]   it needed to be to tell the story.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:40.680]   But I think the most important question to me about this is are people going to be walking
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.700]   around talking about House of Cards to each other to the point where people feel like,
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:49.380]   oh, I have to go check that out or I want to put that on my list of things to see the
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:55.900]   way that Sex in the City, the wire, lost, et cetera, a game of Thrones have been in the
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:56.900]   past.
[01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:01.060]   Whether you've seen them or not, they're definitely, you know someone at least who's
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:05.780]   told you you've got to watch this and House of Cards needs to build up that momentum.
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:09.820]   If it does, if it has that kind of conversation out there, huge win for Netflix and that's
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:10.820]   what they want to keep doing.
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:13.280]   Well, here you guys have been camping a big time.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.400]   Well, I mean, I'm excited about it.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.280]   Tom's only watched the first episode because he's not stepping up to the plate.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:22.280]   Apparently he doesn't value the frame rate experience of cord cutting the way I do.
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.680]   But but the important thing that's exactly right because I hate cord cutting.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.280]   I limited myself to only watching one episode.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.760]   But here's the important thing is that people don't talk about those other shows because
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:34.760]   they're released weekly.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:38.240]   They talk about them because they're exceptional and they're really good and House of Cards
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.240]   is like that.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:45.700]   And then if the success of television is not based on weekly episodic content, it's based
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:46.940]   on good stories.
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:50.820]   And again, all you have to do is look to novels.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:54.740]   What we are doing is we're taking television shows and we're enjoying them the way we enjoy
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:55.740]   novels.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.900]   Novel comes out on a Friday.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.100]   You meet with them on Monday.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.100]   You say, how far in are you?
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.780]   I'm up to page 150.
[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:02.780]   How you like?
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:03.780]   Oh, it's great.
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.580]   And you know where you are because you don't want to spoil something that comes and you
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:07.580]   still have these conversations.
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:10.760]   And it still lasts a long time.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:14.760]   Nothing is being ruined by releasing everything at once.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.960]   Instead, all you're doing is allowing the end user to regulate his own consumption experience.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.480]   And that's nothing but pure rad.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.140]   Let me ask you this.
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.360]   What changes when we move away from the network format?
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:34.180]   What I mean by this is imagine all the things that happen within a typical network TV show
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:37.340]   or even cable TV show that you don't have to do on the Internet.
[01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:40.740]   So episode length, 30 minutes or 60 minutes long.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:44.620]   You have to craft the stories so that there are regular periods at which you can take a
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.700]   break to do advertising.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:51.700]   There are certain things that you have to do in order to lend itself to an episodic
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:56.260]   development of characters that you won't have to do if your episode length can be anything
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:58.020]   it needs to be.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:03.100]   What changes about the storytelling if we free ourselves from the constraints that we've
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:08.020]   put on ourselves in the past 30 years of television?
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:10.420]   Well, I think it's go ahead, Tom.
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:15.060]   I was just going to drag out my dusty old book analogy.
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:17.100]   Novels used to be written in cereal.
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:21.140]   Charles Dickens wrote a bunch of his novels in cereal first and then they were put out
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.980]   his books later.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:29.900]   And I think it's sort of the same same evolution, which is the yes, the form changes, but the
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:30.900]   form changes anyway.
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:34.580]   So it's hard to distinguish what changed because we stopped putting out cereals and
[01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:39.980]   started putting out books fully formed and what changed just because the culture changed.
[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:45.980]   But I think we will see some stories get told that wouldn't get told otherwise.
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:50.260]   And I think of things like Lost where they had to struggle hard to get the network to
[01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:54.500]   let them end the show when they wanted to end it because they had a definite end.
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:59.060]   You can argue whether you like that end or not, but they had it in mind.
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:03.620]   And that is unusual in network television, in broadcast television, cable television,
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:04.620]   even.
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:08.380]   So now Netflix can say, yeah, you just have two seasons of story.
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:09.380]   That's great.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:10.380]   We'll take it.
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:15.980]   And also, you know, maybe it'll make it so that good shows that don't have a huge strong
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:20.380]   audience right out of the gate don't have to get canceled, that they can actually kind
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:25.020]   of live up to their potential without having to force force that, you know, that massive
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:28.660]   initial audience that will keep them on the air.
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:31.980]   Is this the direct video moment for television?
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:35.980]   Just as Hollywood found out that there was a significant amount of money to be made in
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:41.700]   pushing certain content direct to DVD, could now television studios realize that we can
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:45.460]   make series that aren't immediately popular because we know we're going to make it on
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.460]   the back end when we put it up on a service like Amazon or Netflix.
[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:50.860]   I don't know.
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:53.700]   I'm like comfortable with that parallel altogether.
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:59.860]   I mean, direct to DVD is the home of crap cash grabs to squeeze a little more money out
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.620]   of existing franchises.
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:04.340]   So it's hard for me to get excited about that.
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:09.900]   You know, I'm much more intrigued by the ability for independent filmmakers, for documentarians
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:15.820]   to tell stories that have no business being in movie theaters just because nobody would
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:20.700]   go see them, but they're so esoteric that they, by finding their voice in digital, they
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:26.220]   can create these, as we talk about on frame rate, these micro networks, these three four
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:31.300]   man operations that are able to hit profitability because of the economy of scale.
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:36.420]   I think the direct to DVD thing is very interesting because I was talking to a guy who worked
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:41.540]   in Hollywood for years recently, and he said that all the money is gone because they lost
[01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:43.220]   direct to DVD sales.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:49.580]   And in my mind, I feel like we're seeing this big fight against so-called piracy because
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:53.660]   of the direct to DVD sales going away, people stopping buying those.
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:57.900]   This may provide an avenue and an outlet not only for television shows, but for movies
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:01.820]   to be made specifically for Amazon for Hulu for Netflix.
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:05.660]   And I'm interested to see what exploration started happening in that arena.
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:06.660]   All right.
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:07.900]   So I do want to ask this.
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:14.060]   And that is I love the concept of independent filmmakers and independent content makers
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:20.220]   coming into Netflix or to Hulu or to Amazon and actually getting a forum to voice their
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:21.780]   stories.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:24.700]   But how many of us are actually going there for that content?
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:27.140]   I am a Netflix subscriber.
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:28.940]   I watch seasons of Archer.
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.460]   I watch seasons of Stargate Universe.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.820]   I watch television shows.
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:34.900]   I have never watched Lilah Hammer or Harff's House of Cards.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:37.020]   Oh, well, you're an idiot and you're dumb.
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:39.060]   Plus you have a silly face.
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.060]   Absolutely.
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:41.060]   You got to watch those.
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:45.340]   And importantly, the independent content, what I love about the all you can eat, you
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:50.420]   know, welcome to our arcade, have whatever you want attitude that Netflix has is I am
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:55.580]   somebody who is very gun shy about committing to going to a movie, spending my $10 to get
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:58.420]   in and sit down and spend two hours looking at something.
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:34:59.620]   The stakes are too high.
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:04.180]   If it sucks and I feel 30 minutes in and I'm watching something I hate, then that all
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:06.500]   of a sudden I instantly regret the decision.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.700]   But what Netflix has done is they've taken away that I can leave it anytime.
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.820]   I've not paid any entrance fee.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.820]   I can stop anytime I want.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:18.020]   And as a result, there's a number of crazy independent documentaries.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:19.420]   Some of them have been exquisite.
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:22.620]   Some of them I would have rolled my eyes at when I saw them, you know, who killed the
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:25.700]   electric car or the business of being born.
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:31.780]   And I found points that I really would never have heard otherwise because I knew I could
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:33.500]   quit at any time.
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:37.140]   And I did not, I actually couldn't finish the business of being born.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:40.860]   But I'm really glad I watched that first half up until I saw Ricky Lake naked giving
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:41.860]   birth in a tub.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:44.460]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:48.140]   In these eyes, written on this brain, no vaccines on that.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.140]   Sorry.
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.140]   Yeah.
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:52.300]   See, that's not making me want to watch that, really.
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:55.340]   Well, that's the, I watched it so you don't have to.
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:56.340]   Thank you, Netflix.
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:59.300]   Some memories may be tied to a single neuron, Brian.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.820]   We can look into that.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:02.140]   We can get rid of that for you.
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:03.140]   All right.
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:06.740]   So I do want to move on, but I want to stay with that theme because we are talking about
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:09.900]   the new form of content distribution.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:14.420]   This story comes from Wired and it's all about Amazon taken one from Netflix.
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:20.220]   They have scored down to Abby or as I like to call it downtown Arby's from Netflix.
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:21.660]   I know, I know.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:23.220]   Don't do that.
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:26.500]   This is another show which I will admit upfront that I have never watched.
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:27.500]   I want to watch it.
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.300]   I want to wait until I have enough of the series where I could sit down and have a big
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:31.500]   cry fest.
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:36.380]   But starting in mid-June, Amazon prime members will be able to see it and they'll be the
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:42.460]   only ones able to see the legal streams of season three of downtown Abby.
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:48.740]   Now an unspecified while later, seasons one and two will also be only available on Amazon.
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:52.940]   And when season four premieres, it will be available again only on Amazon.
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:55.900]   So they've really put a big bet.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:37:00.460]   We don't know exactly how much money, but a big bet into drawing people into prime because
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:03.380]   of the content that you can get for stream.
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:09.820]   My question to you is, is this the future of content where we're going to have these distributors,
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:14.860]   Amazon, Netflix, maybe you could even throw Hulu in there who are going to be vying for
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:20.540]   these hot spots of content hoping that that's going to be the franchise that they can build
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:21.540]   on?
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:23.540]   Yeah, you know, it's great.
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:27.620]   I think it's great that these networks are picking up these IPs.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:30.460]   But the fact of the matter is it's making it more difficult.
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:34.420]   I mean, we've got all these set top boxes that have like certain services on them.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:38.020]   They either got Amazon streaming, they've got Netflix, they've got, you know, whatever
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.380]   is out there.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:43.300]   And it's frustrating for the consumer because you feel like you have to make a choice.
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.700]   And maybe we've had to make these kinds of choices all along.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:49.140]   But at the end of the day, it's getting harder and harder to decide what you're going to
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:50.540]   be paying money for.
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.620]   Right now I'm a prime member, I'm a Hulu Plus member.
[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:58.580]   You know, I never buy stuff on iTunes, but you know, it's getting harder to choose.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:02.100]   And I think it does, it feels like it does the consumer disservice.
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:05.420]   But maybe that's always how it's going to be.
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:08.540]   Well we again, spoiler, we talked about this on frame rate.
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:10.580]   And if you're not watching frame rate, you really should.
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:14.700]   It's a fine show on the Twit Network live every Monday night with me and Tom Merritt.
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:19.540]   One of the things as much as we don't like to see, and I empathize with where you're
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:22.780]   coming from, where it's like, you know, subscribing to all these different services, the bulk
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:26.580]   organization of the content and new media.
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:31.940]   But on the flip side, there's another part of me where I would rather, I don't care at
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.100]   this point, this is going to sound crazy coming from someone like me.
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:40.340]   I don't care if they divvy up all the content and make it available on like an oligarchy
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:45.220]   of four networks that I have to pay subscription to all four of those, as long as they get
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:48.380]   all the content and I no longer have to pay for cable.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:51.620]   I would much, much rather pay an HBO ghost subscription.
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:56.140]   Amazon Prime subscription, Netflix subscription and Hulu subscription, pay all four of these
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:59.580]   guys and not give one more cent to time, more in a cable.
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:00.580]   That would be amazing.
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:01.580]   But that would be amazing.
[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:03.100]   I would go for that.
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:04.100]   So I don't know.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:09.180]   So when I see stuff like this, it makes me happy to see more players in the environment.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:14.020]   And Father Robert, you're like a Hulu's kind of the red headed stepchild.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:18.220]   I mean, Amazon Prime has been the laggard of the big three.
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:20.500]   It's been Netflix, Hulu and then Amazon Prime.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:24.540]   And the fact that we're seeing these move, this is great news that they're securing.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:29.940]   The fact that they're securing these exclusives means this is a robust market and people recognize
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:31.780]   that there's a lot of opportunity there.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:36.340]   So this is something, while it's not exciting, we shouldn't be happy that there's only one
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:37.660]   place for you to get it now.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:43.260]   We should be happy that people perceive this as a important enough space that they want
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:46.180]   to be the only person that you could get X, Y, and Z.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:51.180]   Now, I remember something that I heard from Dr. Brushwood on an episode of Frame Rate,
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:56.340]   not too long ago, that people really don't give a crap where they're getting it from,
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:58.540]   Netflix, Hulu, Amazon.
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:03.260]   But the problem is that with exclusives, we're making it more complicated.
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:07.020]   We're essentially putting another barrier in the way for people to cut the cords.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:10.900]   Do you no longer subscribe to that theory?
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:14.140]   I don't know who that person is that you're talking about, but he sounds like an idiot.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:20.740]   This guy, however, thinks that as long as there certainly should be as few barriers as
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.860]   possible, and exclusives and windowing makes things complicated for us.
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:29.740]   But there's no reason that we can't see other services provide a concierge service that
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:34.620]   make it to where you don't even know who it is you're paying to get your content.
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:37.580]   You just know you want down NABY and now it's on your screen.
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:38.580]   That's what I'm in favor of.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:41.620]   >> That's kind of what my Tivo does now.
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:46.620]   My Tivo does that.
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.220]   I don't remember.
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:53.180]   Whenever Tivo I have it, I can search for shows and then it'll give me the options about
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:56.580]   where online I can view those shows on my TV.
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:00.940]   So I can either choose from Amazon Prime or Hulu Plus or Netflix.
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:04.980]   So that's good, but then at the same time I have to pay for all of those services.
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:06.820]   I don't know why I pay for Hulu Plus.
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:07.820]   It's terrible.
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:08.820]   >> Put it on pause.
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:09.820]   Just put it on hold.
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:11.260]   That's what I do with my Hulu Plus subscription.
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:13.620]   >> I've had it on hold forever.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.620]   >> Really?
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:17.620]   >> I just wait until there's a reason for me to take it off hold.
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:19.780]   And then I take it off hold to watch whatever I need it for.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.020]   And then I put it back on hold.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.020]   >> Really?
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:24.820]   >> We have cool TV and Wii U both do the same thing you're talking about that the Tivo
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:25.820]   does.
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:26.820]   >> Oh.
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:32.140]   >> But the Tivo does one big thing that the Wii U can't do.
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.380]   It makes that record television?
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:35.140]   >> No, it makes that cool song.
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:37.420]   >> Oh, well, yeah, there's that too.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:38.420]   >> Yes.
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:39.420]   >> Miss that.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:44.060]   >> It's funny that we sit here and we're complaining that exclusives are given just to Amazon
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:45.140]   with Downton Abbey.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:47.660]   But Netflix is going to have an exclusive on Disney movies.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:51.340]   When the complaint up till now has been you can't get everything online.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:54.700]   So we have immediately switched over from complaining like we can't even get this stuff
[01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:58.100]   online to we can only get this stuff one place online.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:00.580]   >> But Tom, it's her job to complain about everything.
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:01.580]   >> Believe me.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:02.580]   >> Publicly.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:03.580]   >> Get out of it, Tom.
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:08.380]   >> But if people stop complaining, I'd have to go back to my real job.
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:11.300]   >> It's not that different from getting a cable subscription.
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:14.900]   Let's say the cable subscription is like your internet subscription and then having to choose
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:15.900]   your tier.
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.020]   What channels do you want to get?
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:20.700]   There's basic channels, there's advanced basic channels, then there's your premium channels
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:25.140]   and you got to know what shows you want from those tiers and then that's how you pick what
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.300]   tier you pay for.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:32.300]   >> I think it would be at this point I could probably with a few exceptions, I could cut
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:37.940]   the cord and just maintain my online video subscription services and be in pretty good
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:38.940]   shape.
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:43.220]   So you're right, that is a very good thing and I'm glad that more of this content that
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:47.820]   down to now be is, I mean, what season is that on now?
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:49.780]   >> We're going into season four.
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:51.300]   >> We're going into season four.
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:56.140]   I know that showing, seeing it on TV here in the US, it's like a season behind, right?
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:57.140]   >> Right.
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:59.100]   We're in the middle of season three here in the US.
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.060]   >> Okay, so I think it would be great.
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:04.980]   It would be great if it was actually timely with what they're showing over there.
[01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:09.140]   You know, when the show comes on, if you're willing to pay for it via Amazon Prime, which
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:14.580]   by the way, Amazon Prime just in general is life changing, so I highly recommend it.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:18.620]   That would make it even more worth it to me if it was timely in that regard.
[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:20.620]   >> All right.
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:21.620]   >> Dead silence.
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:22.620]   >> Dead silence.
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:23.620]   >> Yeah.
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.460]   Actually, I have a question for Tom.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:29.900]   Tom, could you, something that I've wanted to do since I got onto the Twit Network, I've
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:33.220]   wanted to learn how to do proper segues.
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:35.340]   How would you do a segway?
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:39.820]   >> You know, I've been thinking for a long time, Father Robert, of starting a website
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:43.900]   that just gives some of the things I've learned about doing segues, and maybe pointing to
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:46.220]   some of the people that I've learned from out there.
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:50.380]   And one of the easy ways for me to do that would be with our sponsor, Squarespace.com,
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:54.100]   the fast and easy way to create a high quality website or blog.
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.300]   We use it for sort of laser, Veronica and I.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:01.780]   It's a super simple way to get not only a great looking website, but a website where
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:06.140]   you can concentrate just on the content that you're putting in there.
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:10.260]   So you can go and just write your headlines, write your posts, put up your photos, make
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:15.820]   a gallery, couple clicks, what you see is what you get in the new Squarespace 6, and
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:19.540]   it takes care of the reliability, making sure everything's served, making sure that your
[01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:25.260]   site has a mobile responsive design that looks right on a phone, looks right on a tablet
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:28.020]   that auto plays music sometimes if you wanted to.
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:30.100]   All of that taken care of.
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:31.700]   You don't have to think about it.
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:35.300]   Brian, you had a great story about putting together that website about pandas.
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:39.540]   Oh my gosh, here's how crazy easy Squarespace is.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:43.500]   My daughter learned, apparently she learned in school that pandas are in trouble.
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:46.020]   So she comes home and be like, Dad, I want to make a website.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:50.020]   And I was like, I don't want to, I don't even know where my copy of Dreamweaver is.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:52.500]   I don't even remember half of this crap.
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:56.380]   And so I just went and I hooked her up with a trial account at Squarespace.
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:59.900]   And then she, before I knew I'd turned around and she had already registered, she'd set
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:07.240]   it all up, panda-save.org is now my eight year old daughter, so easy and eight year old
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:08.240]   could do it.
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:13.300]   And it probably looks better than your website in your face person I'm talking to.
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.940]   That's how easy Squarespace is.
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:15.940]   Is.
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.940]   Wait, can that dash save?
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:18.940]   Panda dash save.
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:19.940]   Thanks.com.
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:20.940]   Actually, not.org.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:21.940]   Not com.
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:22.940]   Yes, it's not com.
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:23.940]   Com.
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:24.940]   Com.
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:25.940]   Com.
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:26.940]   Com.
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:31.940]   It's adorable.
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:32.940]   Look at it.
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:33.940]   Look at it, man.
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:34.940]   They have to use the same layout as my wedding website.
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:35.940]   Take a look at this.
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:39.220]   Like, if you click on the blog or whatever, she says, or action or blog or about one of
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:42.140]   those, like she explains that, uh, there we go.
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:45.740]   What's it say there says there at school, we read a passage on pandas.
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:48.540]   It may be really sad to find out that there are so few left.
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:50.940]   So I made this website to encourage people to donate.
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.460]   Now look at the adorable picture.
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:53.460]   She's got it right.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:54.460]   She got the priority, right?
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.940]   Panda's our aliens.
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:56.940]   So cute.
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:57.940]   26 amazing.
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:58.940]   Wow.
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:45:59.940]   That's a lot of time.
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:04.300]   That's how easy it is to set up a Squarespace.com site and make it even easier.

[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:32.180]   We thanks Squarespace for their support of all the shows on Twit.
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:34.540]   This is my favorite part here.
[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:36.580]   It says here, pandas are endangered.
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:39.420]   How you can help go to a site like this one and donate.
[01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:41.060]   We do not accept donations.
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:43.980]   Well, Tom, I want to thank you.
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:46.540]   That was an awesome tutorial on how to do segues.
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:47.860]   I appreciate that.
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.420]   I will study that and try to incorporate that into all of our Twit.
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:52.420]   You're careful not to make you so much.
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:53.420]   I hope you found it helpful.
[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:54.420]   I hope you found it helpful.
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:55.420]   That's right.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:57.420]   Oh, oh, that was too soon.
[01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:58.420]   That was too soon.
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:03.780]   All right, let's get into the home stretch where we're going to get super, super geeky.
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:05.780]   Thankfully, we've got the right panel for this.
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:11.780]   I'm calling it Hacker Alley starting with the crazy, nasty, scary vulnerability in UPNP.
[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:13.620]   That's universal plug and play.
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:17.980]   This is a feature that has been incorporated into network devices, usually consumer slash
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:21.340]   small business network devices for the last 12 years.
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:25.820]   What it allows you to do is it allows you to have a router and have devices behind it
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:30.380]   that are pinged by a discovery packet, which the router will then say, "Hey, what do you
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:31.380]   need?"
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:34.740]   For example, you can have an Xbox Live that says, "I need these ports open so that I could
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:35.940]   play games."
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.100]   You've got a Skype phone that says, "I need these ports open so that I can establish
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:42.220]   a direct communication line to another Skype device."
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:45.420]   You've got toasters and refrigerators that say, "I need these ports open so that someone
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:48.060]   can ping me to find out whether or not I need service."
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:50.820]   That's the kind of thing that UPNP does.
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:58.380]   Well, the problem that has been discovered by HDMore, the man of Metasploit fame, and
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:05.700]   reported on by our very own Steve Gibson is that this UPNP service is insecure.
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:10.420]   In fact, Pro has been turning it off for years because it requires no authentication.
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:14.980]   Basically, any device in the network can configure a router.
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:16.660]   That's not necessarily the best thing to do.
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:23.140]   Now imagine that I give that power to reconfigure my router to everything outside of my router.
[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:24.940]   That's the vulnerability that we're talking about.
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:29.620]   This UPNP feature, which should only be accessible from inside the LAN, has been found to be
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:36.740]   available on the WAN port, the outside, the internet-facing port, on over 81 million devices.
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:40.980]   HDMore did a scan of the internet, a complete scan, using enough servers so that he could
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:46.660]   scan every address in the IPv4 space once a week, and he did this for five and a half
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.660]   months.
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:52.700]   What he found was that there are 81 million devices that have UPNP turned on on the WAN
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:53.700]   port.
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:58.580]   Now, let me stress, there's absolutely no good reason to have it on in the WAN port.
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:02.220]   That should never be turned on to the outside world.
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:08.020]   What this allows people to do, who are, say, like me, is they can send a discovery packet,
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:12.620]   UDP packet, to your router, find out exactly what operating system it's running, and then
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:17.620]   reconfigure it so that it can start looking at all the devices on the other side of your
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:18.620]   firewall.
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:21.220]   It's a horrible, horrible exploit.
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:26.020]   Well, it's something that we've seen coming because we knew that UPNP was insecure.
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:31.180]   We knew that it should be turned off, and yet it turns out that these manufacturers have
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:35.660]   not just left it on, but they've improperly used it.
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:42.820]   My question to the panel is this, we're seeing more and more situations in which dumb consumer
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:47.340]   level devices, things that we thought, "Oh, I just buy it and it works," are no longer
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:48.340]   that way.
[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:53.260]   When I go to Fry's or Best Buy, I expect that if I buy a name-brand router and I plug it
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:55.500]   in, it's just going to work out of the box.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:00.380]   It looks like we're actually expecting more understanding and more knowledge out of end
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:04.260]   users than we used to.
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:08.620]   What kind of trends do you guys see here?
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:09.620]   You know what?
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:14.900]   It's tough to say because, look, I ain't in the business of telling other people what
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:20.220]   they think or what they're good at or what they'll be smart about doing.
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:26.460]   But it does seem like, look, if there's a sin, it's making too many options here.
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:28.220]   It seems like a lot of this stuff self-corrects.
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:31.740]   For example, I'm looking at the story right now in the chat room.
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:34.860]   He says, "Well, my router just passed the test."
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.740]   I said, "What test?"
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:42.980]   Instantly forward me a link over to Gibson Research Corporation, of course, to check for
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:44.940]   the vulnerability on this exact thing.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:47.540]   Here, let me see if I can actually show it to you right here.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:48.540]   Shield's up.
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:50.140]   I've got it on my screen chat.
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.380]   Just so you know, Steve Gibson shields up.
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:54.300]   I'll get you to the right place.
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:55.300]   Right there.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:56.980]   So it's like, there it is.
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:50:58.740]   And it tells me that I'm fine.
[01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:01.620]   And it's like, I have permission to remain dumb.
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:03.940]   I don't have to know why I'm safe.
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:06.100]   I just have to know that I'm safe.
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:07.300]   And I do now.
[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:08.300]   So it's like, I don't know.
[01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:11.380]   It's like, this is one of those things where it's because we have people like Steve Gibson
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:17.100]   out there who are so passionate about finding these exploits and security holes and exposing
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.100]   them.
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:23.740]   And as a result, I can remain completely dumb and I'm thrilled to remain as ignorant and
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.540]   as stupid as I possibly can.
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.420]   But you have to be informed enough to actually know that you have to run the test, which
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:29.420]   is the thing.
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:31.500]   You get people to know that they need to run this test.
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:32.500]   Right.
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:34.140]   I mean, obviously we're doing it right now, public service, everybody.
[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:35.140]   You're welcome.
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:39.060]   But those people who are unfortunate enough to not be watching right now, who might be,
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:43.260]   I don't know, tuned into a certain football game taking place in a large container of
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:47.020]   some sort, you know, how do we educate them?
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:51.020]   Well, that's always been the question because we want to make these devices dead simple.
[01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:52.420]   And so everything is always plug and play.
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:54.260]   I mean, that's the catchphrase.
[01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:58.500]   Even though pros kind of wince every time we hear plug and play because plug and play normally
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:02.740]   means incredibly insecure, that's how you sell a device.
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:05.620]   You don't want to tell someone, oh, we're going to sell you this gaming console.
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:10.300]   And all you have to do is open up port 21 20 in order to get an outbound connection to
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.500]   work properly with another.
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:13.060]   No, you can't do that.
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:17.660]   It's got to be as long as you have this router and this device and you turn it on, it will
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:18.660]   work.
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:20.940]   Well, but that doesn't lend itself to security.
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:23.380]   So yeah, these are always going to be at odds.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:28.220]   So the question here really isn't, well, should everyone just start learning about network
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:29.580]   security because that's not going to happen.
[01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:34.060]   The question becomes what do manufacturers have to do to include the same level of drop
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:42.620]   dead, easy to use along with at least the motor come of network security.
[01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:44.420]   Anyone want to argue against network security here?
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:46.540]   No, I mean, they should be there.
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:50.260]   Veronica, I really like to hear your devil's advocate view of network security.
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:54.740]   I mean, it is hard to decide who's whose responsibility it is at the end of the day.
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:58.380]   I tend to think that it should be the consumer's responsibility.
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:01.700]   I understand why people would think it should be the manufacturer's responsibility.
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:06.620]   But like I said, at the end of the day, it's our responsibility to understand what we're
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:10.460]   purchasing and how we're using it and the consequences of using it incorrectly.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:12.340]   I'll strike the middle.
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:14.660]   And I'll say it is, you're right.
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:17.780]   It is your responsibility to secure your machines.
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:24.500]   But there is also responsibility on the device makers to not knowingly provide insecure
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:25.500]   products.
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:29.700]   And when they do know about something, as in this case, to work to secure them and inform
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:32.860]   their consumers, hey, you know, we're the experts on building this stuff and we just
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:33.860]   found this out.
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:35.180]   So, you know, here's the solution.
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:36.180]   Here's the fix.
[01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:38.620]   Is there any kind of formal, like a recall process?
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:41.980]   I mean, if you buy a children's stroller and it's not safe for your children, obviously
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:43.500]   there's a process for getting their recall.
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.460]   Is there anything like that for the tech community?
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:46.660]   Absolutely not for this problem.
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:48.660]   I think this is an opportunity.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:49.660]   Right.
[01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:54.260]   Raulters are a weird device because people tend to buy them and then they're never supported
[01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:58.500]   because they are a dumb device, because typically you plug it in and you'll never see it again.
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.060]   They don't get a lot of support.
[01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:03.740]   And most of the ones that you buy, unless it's really expensive, they don't do automatic
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:04.580]   updates.
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:08.780]   So most people are running a router with 10 year old code.
[01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:09.780]   Not cool.
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:10.780]   You're not supposed to.
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:15.060]   You would not hook up a Windows computer that has not been patched for 10 years.
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:16.580]   Why would you do that with your router?
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:17.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:18.580]   Don't do that.
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:19.580]   I don't know.
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:20.580]   Makes me skin.
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:25.140]   I am universally on the side of whenever whatever the question is, I'm always in favor of more
[01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:28.900]   options and more power to the person buying it, which means even if you want to do something
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:33.420]   stupid, something idiotic, like it's the Linux defense, right?
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:38.260]   If you know, you can type a single command in Linux that will utterly destroy everything
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:41.540]   and it won't even bother to ask you, are you sure you want to do this?
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:43.460]   And it's like, I'm okay with that.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:48.060]   That's that's it's there should exist operating systems where you can do that.
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:49.740]   Now, is that the operating system for everyone?
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:50.740]   No.
[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:53.060]   Do I strongly want that to be available to everyone?
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:54.060]   Yes.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:58.620]   And so as a result, if what you want to do is run an insecure network on your router and
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:01.460]   not bothered to update it, well, you buy go nuts, man.
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:02.460]   It's enjoy.
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:03.460]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:07.740]   I will say this that here at Twit, we are dedicated to the health, not just the physical
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:10.420]   health, but the cyber health of everyone who watches.
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:14.860]   And that's why we have two shows security now with Leo the Port and Steve Gibson.
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:19.540]   And this we can enterprise tech with some geeky priest in which we discuss issues just
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:23.100]   like this, issues that might just save your digital life.
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:25.900]   So tune into those things.
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:26.900]   That was a segue, right?
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:27.900]   That was a really, yeah, that was an excellent.
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:28.900]   That was just a question.
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:29.900]   That was an excellent question.
[01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:32.260]   And I highly recommend this weekend enterprise tech.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:34.340]   So I highly recommend security now as well.
[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:37.540]   More people are probably familiar with security now, which is an education.
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:39.340]   You should come out of that thing with a degree.
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:43.260]   But this weekend enterprise tech father, you guys do a great job of explaining what's
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:47.420]   going on in the enterprise IT world in a way that even if you're not in the enterprise
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:50.140]   IT world, it's interesting and you learn something from it.
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:53.660]   And we have bacon pancakes.
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:54.660]   Let's move on.
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:55.660]   All right.
[01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:57.540]   So back into hackers, Ali, we're in the home stretch.
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:02.300]   Let's talk a little bit about China because China hackers are all in the news this last
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:06.420]   week with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, both admitting that they have
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:07.660]   been hacked.
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:10.660]   The New York Times has been attacked for the last four months, whereas the Wall Street
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:14.340]   Journal has said that they've been getting attacked for the last couple of years.
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:19.460]   Now it's interesting to note that it looks as if the hackers were not trying to get
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:21.220]   access to any customer data.
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:22.380]   They weren't looking for credit cards.
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:24.660]   They weren't looking for personalized information.
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:29.540]   They were looking for sources of stories that were running in each news source, which
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:32.660]   again, that's that's one of the reasons why people think it was China.
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:38.700]   It was a state sponsored as effort to find out who was behind various stories.
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:44.380]   In the New York Times case, it was the story behind the minister of I cannot remember his
[01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:49.220]   name or his position, but that makes it so much more fun.
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:53.140]   And they were trying to find out exactly who leaked the information about the investigation.
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:59.020]   In the case of the Wall Street Journal, the the tax originated from IPs within Russia,
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:03.020]   but were traced back to methods used by Chinese cybersecurity.
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:09.260]   And again, it seemed to be focused on finding sources of leaks about hiring processes that
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:11.260]   were going on in factories.
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:16.580]   Now what's interesting about this is they're they're using zero day exploits along with
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:21.140]   botnets of computers that have been compromised within the United States.
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:26.300]   In the case of the New York Times stories, they took over campus networks at various
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:31.700]   universities across the country and used it to brute force their way into various computers
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:34.140]   connected to the New York Times network.
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:40.900]   Now I bring all this up because there is a great story about Google's Eric Schmidt blasting
[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:42.740]   China as the internet menace.
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:47.300]   He has a new book coming out called the digital age and he calls China the world's most active
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:52.700]   and enthusiastic filter of information as well as saying that the reason why they have such
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:57.860]   an advanced cyber warfare effort is because there is a very close relationship between
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:58:00.140]   the tech industry and the government.
[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:04.860]   He calls for us to do the same thing in order to a head off the time type of attacks that
[01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:09.020]   hit the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, but also to build up our own capability
[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:10.420]   to do the same.
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:16.700]   My question to all of you is the cyber Pearl harbors is gone and passed, right?
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:20.020]   I mean, we're already in the middle of it.
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:24.020]   When you say question to you.
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:25.860]   That's a specific person you're talking about.
[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:28.780]   I was specifically speaking to you, Dr. Brushwood.
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:29.780]   No.
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:30.780]   You weren't.
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:34.100]   You were talking to someone else, someone who knows something, someone who could talk
[01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:39.460]   about something besides online video and movies, somebody who doesn't even fire for a living.
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:45.180]   I don't think we're even close to the cyber Pearl Harbor yet.
[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:49.380]   That's a bit of a stretch in terms of analogy, I would say.
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.380]   Tim, what do you think?
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:56.740]   It's a little bit of a over-hype, the whole cyber Pearl Harbor, but it's also kind of necessary
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:01.060]   to scare us straight, I guess.
[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:05.820]   It's less like Pearl Harbor and it's more like some war that I can't think of right
[01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:10.260]   now that started very slowly and creepingly began to become a huge thing later on.
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:13.860]   Is that like a cold war?
[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:14.860]   Maybe.
[01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:15.860]   Or maybe.
[01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:18.740]   Like of the Cold War escalated past.
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:20.220]   Now like the Hundred Years War.
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:21.220]   A Hundred Years War?
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:26.700]   I compared to when the Filipino military revolted and tried to take over the government by
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:29.700]   occupying the megamall in downtown Manila.
[01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:33.900]   I have no idea why I just brought that up.
[01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:37.900]   Obviously there's a lot of emotion going back and forth because it seems to be a bit
[01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:40.220]   of a nationalistic geekery here.
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:44.020]   But there is something to be said about the fact that China has used some of the best
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:48.460]   and brightest engineers that can find in order to pull off these attacks allegedly.
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:53.100]   Whereas here in the United States we tend to take those same people and put them in jail.
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:54.100]   Yeah.
[01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:56.700]   Okay, crickets crickets.
[01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:58.700]   Alright, you know what?
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:01.100]   This whole hacker alley thing was it's kind of a bust.
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:05.620]   I think it's the wrong time for this because we're all dreaming of sporting events.
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:10.100]   I will add one little hack that was given to us by a very OMG Chad.
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:14.820]   And that is if you own a Mac right now I want you to open up any program in which you can
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:15.820]   type something.
[02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:16.820]   Don't do this.
[02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:18.780]   Any program in which you can type something.
[02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:19.780]   I don't trust it.
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:23.100]   And I want you to type in capital F.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:30.060]   So F.I.L.E. semi colon slash slash slash.
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:33.340]   I thought it was colon colon sorry colon.
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:34.660]   Yeah, just colon colon.
[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:35.660]   Colin.
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:38.700]   This is the first app that I found that it doesn't do it.
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:41.100]   It doesn't do in text Wrangler.
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.020]   Didn't do it in colloquy.
[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:45.420]   OMG did you say what did you find me?
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:46.420]   Did you find it?
[02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:47.420]   Oh, look.
[02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:48.420]   Look it did.
[02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:49.420]   It did work actually.
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:53.660]   It will crash anything in a Mac.
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:56.500]   Still didn't crash it on me.
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:57.700]   Did I write it wrong?
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:58.700]   It's amazing.
[02:00:58.700 --> 02:01:03.340]   It has to be the capital F is very important.
[02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:09.020]   Capital F colon slash slash slash not backslash but slash slash slash.
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:11.300]   File slash slash slash.
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:14.660]   How does something like this I'll tell you what's amazing about bugs like this.
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:19.100]   My brother worked on the snap.
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:20.900]   It just crashed notational velocity.
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:21.900]   Yeah.
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:22.900]   Yeah.
[02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:24.240]   And here's notes.
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:25.240]   It's not working.
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:26.240]   Wait, yeah.
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:27.240]   It's like me.
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:29.420]   I typed it right in colloquy and it still didn't crash it.
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:30.420]   I'll try again.
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:31.420]   Yeah, ADM has crashed.
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:32.740]   Do you not even entering it as a command?
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:33.740]   Oh, no.
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:35.460]   It's just typing it and it craps the bed.
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:38.860]   And Chad, do you want to explain a little bit about putting that into a chat program?
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:39.860]   So yes.
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:44.620]   So if you really want to troll someone on a Mac, you can send that via iMessage.
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:50.220]   And it will always crash their iMessage because it is saved in history.
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:54.060]   So you have to go back into application support to delete the history.
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:55.060]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:56.060]   Yeah.
[02:01:56.060 --> 02:02:04.100]   And the theory running around the internet is that this is a bug in the spell checker.
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:11.580]   And so any time that Apple runs its spell check service on file, a capital F file slash
[02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:13.380]   slash slash it crashes the app.
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:16.540]   And so here's another dead app.
[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:21.060]   I'm just amazing to be Chad because like, like I was saying, my brother worked on the
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:24.700]   team that did the multiplayer for return to Castle Wolfenstein.
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:28.820]   And I almost six months after it had come out, I was at my brother's office.
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:29.980]   He's like, yeah, we got a problem.
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:30.980]   I was like, what?
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:31.980]   He's like, watch this.
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:32.980]   And he's in a multiplayer map.
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:37.100]   And he's like, he's staying here and put on the binoculars.
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:39.900]   Now hit this so you tilt to the side.
[02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:46.660]   And then he just starts hitting G and unlimited grenades start coming out like to do this
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:47.660]   exact thing.
[02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:48.660]   I was like, dude, do people though?
[02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:50.500]   He's like, apparently it's everywhere now.
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:53.780]   So it's like, it's amazing to me that you can discover these things years and years and
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:56.100]   years after the vulnerability occurs.
[02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:59.260]   So everyone listening to this episode right now, what I'd like you to do is I'd like
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:04.900]   to add that exact stream of text into the bottom of your SIG that goes off on every email
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:05.900]   you ever send out.
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:10.860]   It's only works in Mountain Lion according to the next web.
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:13.180]   And it even crashes the error reporter.
[02:03:13.180 --> 02:03:14.180]   That's amazing.
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:17.780]   That poses a bit of a problem, doesn't it?
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:21.900]   If there's anybody who deserves to receive this message, like where should it be?
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:24.100]   Should everyone make it their Facebook status?
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:26.220]   Should it be your your choice?
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:27.220]   Should you send a tweet with it?
[02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:31.660]   That's the thing is it was hard to I wrote a tweet about it and it was hard to get it
[02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:37.100]   out to people because you have to type, you know, capital F file, the call is I was
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:38.500]   slash hit space.
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:42.140]   And so what I found that I could do is I could copy it from another article and the
[02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:44.580]   spell checker in Mountain Lion.
[02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:48.340]   If you copy and paste something, it won't spell check your paste.
[02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:52.860]   So you can copy and paste as long as you don't go back and actually like leave your
[02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:54.740]   cursor on the thing.
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:56.860]   But yeah, that was the only way that I could get it.
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:03.020]   According to Nick Kublovic, it's in the check data detector.
[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:09.260]   Data detector pulls any kind of complete file URL and validates it.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:14.580]   And when it validates it, it makes sure that it starts with lowercase f i l e colon slash
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:16.180]   slash.
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:21.500]   And so when you put the capital F there and just have the slash slash slash for some reason,
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:27.620]   that causes an internal inconsistency exception and that's what crashes the application.
[02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:31.060]   There's actually the exact same problem that you can do in Windows, but the key string
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:34.660]   is out and F four.
[02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:35.660]   Try it now, everyone.
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:37.140]   It's shift five times.
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:40.220]   Linux is our own dish or if that's right.
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:41.220]   That's right.
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:42.220]   That's right.
[02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:45.740]   Now we are running really close to the start of a certain sporting event.
[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:49.820]   So what I'm going to ask Tom, Tom, you know, I really appreciate the lesson that you gave
[02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:51.260]   me on segues.
[02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:55.980]   But what can you tell me about advertising stuff that's going to come up on the Twit
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:58.580]   network?
[02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:03.220]   Well, Chad, do you have the tape ready?
[02:05:03.220 --> 02:05:04.220]   I do.
[02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:05.220]   Oh, okay.
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:06.220]   You should have played it right then.
[02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:07.220]   Okay.
[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:08.220]   Here we go.
[02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:09.220]   Nicely done, gentlemen.
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:22.940]   Your router is promiscuously responding to unsolicited incoming nonsense from the public's
[02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:25.100]   sniff by ports, Windows weekly.
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:26.100]   Take it with you.
[02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:30.100]   Put it in your purse or a purse if you're Paul.
[02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:36.660]   So yeah, some sort of strange, effeminacy, Paul, that is undeserved.
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:40.100]   Because you're more manly than most men.
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:41.100]   Certainly.
[02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:43.540]   You certainly make me just a shrivel up.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:44.540]   Wow.
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:47.060]   What a slug in the sun.
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:48.060]   Triagulation.
[02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:50.060]   It's called Randy Dandio.
[02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:53.260]   Now you're ready to head for the horn.
[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:56.060]   Way, hey, roll and go.
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:58.660]   Our boots and our eyes can system apart.
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:01.660]   And we're really getting Randy Bandio.
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:06.500]   If you miss the evil, the evil, this week on Swit, yeah, you must have loved those.
[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:13.980]   By the way, that was actually the voice of the actor who does Porky Pig.
[02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:17.580]   He was here for the tech guy last week and we were quoted a few ditties.
[02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:18.580]   Yeah.
[02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:21.020]   So we're hoping to spread that across the Twitter network.
[02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:22.020]   Awesome.
[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:23.620]   We're pretty much done, right?
[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:25.700]   Stick a fork in this one.
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:27.540]   I think so.
[02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:28.540]   I think probably.
[02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:30.060]   You're going to do the week ahead?
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:33.420]   Because I did the whole record the whole week ahead and I have a little joke in it.
[02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:34.420]   Yeah.
[02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:35.420]   Well, I thought that's not it's not very good.
[02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:37.660]   That's that's actually what we were going to run.
[02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:39.460]   But that's what Chad was going to run.
[02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:42.340]   Father Robert, good to see filling in for Leo.
[02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:44.660]   Who's that weird guy that looks like me on the panel though?
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:45.660]   That's kind of odd.
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:49.260]   Anyway, here's some things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on tech news today.
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:54.060]   Monday, February 4th, rim will begin trading on the stock market as Blackberry, although
[02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:57.220]   the legal change of the company's name will come later this year.
[02:06:57.220 --> 02:06:58.980]   Also it's Facebook's birthday.
[02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:00.300]   So wish him a happy birthday.
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:04.940]   Tuesday, February 5th, new 128 gigabyte iPads will be available.
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.660]   Also, Zinga has their earnings call.
[02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:09.460]   Wednesday, February 6th, Yelp has their earnings.
[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:14.220]   It's also the first of two days of 500 startups demo day in Mountain View.
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:18.020]   Thursday, February 7th, LinkedIn has their earnings call.
[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:23.100]   Friday, February 8th, Microsoft will launch the Surface Pro at Best Buy in New York and
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:24.580]   Saturday, February 9th.
[02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:29.620]   The Surface Pro sales begin in the United States and Canada starting at $899.
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:30.620]   So look at the week ahead.
[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:32.420]   Back to you, Father Robert.
[02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:36.140]   Thank you, Tom and Tom and Chad.
[02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:40.940]   So here we are at the end of an episode of Twitch, slightly derailed by the Super Bowl,
[02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:43.980]   definitely derailed by Hackers Alley.
[02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:48.700]   I do want to thank all the panelists here for sacrificing a Sunday for coming on to
[02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:51.540]   talk to me about pretty much everything.
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:55.180]   Brian Brushwood, I've always been a big fan of yours.
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:58.700]   I love the program that you do on the Twitch network and off the Twitch network.
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:03.260]   Tell me, what are the things that you're working on right now that people need to know about?
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:05.340]   First of all, you should watch Frame Rate with me and Tom Merritt.
[02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:06.340]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:09.820]   Also, we're doing a, I'm trying something that we've never done on scam school before.
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:13.980]   A bunch of people are asking me to teach more advanced magic tricks, stuff that would be
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:16.820]   too complicated for us to do on scam school.
[02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:21.660]   So tomorrow, this will probably be like today, if you're listening to it on Monday, we should
[02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.460]   have it available at scamstuff.com.
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:30.540]   Our first extra credit episode, it's like a 23 minute episode where I teach one of the
[02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:33.460]   most versatile magic tricks you could do.
[02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:35.220]   There's no special skill required.
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:36.860]   It's just a little bit of process.
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:39.340]   It's something a little more in depth than a scam school episode.
[02:08:39.340 --> 02:08:42.100]   I want to start teaching better magic to folks.
[02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:46.020]   And also, we're doing a bunch more stuff from this studio thanks to our friends over at
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:50.100]   Dog House Systems who hooked me up with the Max Trollbox.
[02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:51.100]   There he is right there.
[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:54.060]   That's a webcam pointed at the side of my computer.
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.820]   They even set up like a promo code.
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:59.540]   I don't know if you remember, but Dog House, they were one of the big promoters of Game
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:00.540]   On.
[02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:04.740]   They did the double your memory promotion and helped keep that show going as long as it
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:05.740]   did.
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:11.060]   They're setting up another code, Schwood, and you can get the Max Trollbox art on the side
[02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:12.900]   of your game rig.
[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:14.700]   And I got a bunch of loot for you as well.
[02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:15.700]   Details are online.
[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:20.300]   And of course, you can find Brian here on the Twit Network every Tuesday on the Not Safe
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:22.300]   for Work show.
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:24.980]   What's the time of that show live?
[02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:30.420]   Usually 9 p.m. central, 7 p.m. Pacific at, you know, here at live.twit.tv.
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:31.420]   All right.
[02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:35.780]   Veronica Belmont, it's an absolute pleasure to finally have you on the show.
[02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:39.740]   I've been trying to get you for a while because, well, you're just so perfect.
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:40.820]   What's going on in your world?
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:42.060]   What do you want to promote?
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:43.540]   I'm not perfect.
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:45.300]   I'm doing three shows right now.
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:49.020]   I'm doing Tekzilla with Patrick Norton every week over on revision three.com.
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:53.820]   I've got Factor Fictional every Friday on youtube.com/techfeed also a revision three
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:54.820]   show.
[02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:59.420]   And of course, Sorden Laser with Tom at Sorden Laser.com or youtube.com/geekinsundry.
[02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:01.900]   We also have the audio podcast over at Sorden Laser.com.
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:03.500]   And again, thank you for coming on.
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:07.180]   I know you're busy, but you know, it just makes things a little bit better when we've
[02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:09.300]   got a dose of Belmont.
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:15.900]   Tom Merritt over in Los Angeles, of course, host of TNT and frame rate on the Twit Network.
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:18.540]   What other things are afoot for you?
[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:20.500]   I don't know what's left.
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.660]   You booked all my co-hosts practically.
[02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:26.820]   But Tom Merritt.com is the place to keep up with what I do.
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:30.900]   You know, one of the things I do at Tom Merritt.com is this day today in tech history.
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:36.660]   I post every day three items, sometimes four of what happened in tech history.
[02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:40.140]   So if you're interested in what happened on this day in tech, go check it out.
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:41.140]   All right.
[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:44.500]   And Tim Stevens, you flew in all the way from the east coast to be with us and to share
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:48.180]   that preview of the Blackberry 10.
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:49.180]   What's going on in a gadget?
[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:53.180]   Yeah, I'm here kind of putting some final things in place for actually an event we have
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:56.740]   coming up in March here in San Francisco called Expand, which I hope you guys will come and
[02:10:56.740 --> 02:10:57.740]   join us for.
[02:10:57.740 --> 02:11:01.340]   We're going to have a lot of tech companies showing off gadgets, some things I can't
[02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:04.220]   talk about, unfortunately, but there'll be some products launched at the show.
[02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:06.020]   We're going to have a lot of really interesting speakers.
[02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:08.940]   Chris Anderson is going to be there, a former editor in Superwire, talking about his new
[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:09.940]   UAV startup.
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:13.220]   We're going to have Julie Erman from Uya talking about her console.
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:18.500]   We're going to have Nancy Strickler from, I hear, did you hear something?
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:21.340]   Nancy Strickler is going to be there talking about crowdfunding.
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:24.900]   We're going to actually have a contest where people can effectively get funded to launch
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:25.900]   their product.
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:30.820]   And we're going to have a very, very, very special guest talking about tech and novels
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:31.820]   and stuff.
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:34.660]   Ms. Veronica Belmont will be there as well, speaking.
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:35.660]   Wow.
[02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:36.660]   Wow.
[02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:38.820]   So that'll be March 16th, the 17th here in San Francisco.
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:41.260]   And you get tickets on our website in gadget.com/expand.
[02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:42.700]   Well, thank you.
[02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:43.700]   Thank you for being on.
[02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:44.700]   Thank you very much.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:47.300]   Of course, you can find me at Twitter, Padre S.J.
[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:48.300]   Follow me there.
[02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:50.900]   You'll be able to find out what's going on in the life of the digital Jesuit.
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:54.300]   Or if you want to find out what I'm doing here on Twitch, well, you got to stop by this
[02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:55.540]   week in Enterprise Tech.
[02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:57.580]   That's at twit.tv/twiet.
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:04.740]   Also, I want to let you know that what we record this show usually live every Sunday
[02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:12.340]   at three o'clock Pacific, but you can find all of our episodes at twit.tv/twit.
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:14.220]   So we've got a brand new YouTube channel.
[02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:18.340]   We're doing YouTube the way it was supposed to be done by giving each show its own channel.
[02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:24.260]   So if you go to youtube.com/thisweekintech, you can find all the new episodes of twit.
[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:26.260]   And maybe a couple of surprises.
[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:28.500]   It's a grand experiment in community.
[02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:29.940]   Who knows where it's going to go.
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:33.180]   Finally, I want to thank everyone who makes this show possible.
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:34.700]   Chad, our fantastic TD.
[02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:39.020]   Chad, do you want to say a few things about the projects you're working on?
[02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:43.580]   Sure, I do a little show about Minecraft called OMGCraft.
[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:45.540]   You can check out at OMGCraft.com.
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:50.540]   And then I work here at the Twit Network on MacPrick Weekly Twig.
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:53.540]   This show this week in tech and stuff like that.
[02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:54.540]   Thanks.
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:58.900]   Leo will be back next week after a rousing 49ers win.
[02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:03.180]   But for now, another twit is in the can.
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:05.180]   He's amazing.
[02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:12.180]   You want a twit?
