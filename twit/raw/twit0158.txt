[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And we're going to talk about today's tech news, including
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Hurricane Gustav, which is as we speak, rolling towards
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Louisiana and some of our most devoted listeners.

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   >> Good to have you on.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Dwight Silverman from the Chronicle, the Houston Chronicle,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   who will be no doubt --
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   >> It's great to be here.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   >> -- on Gustav Duty soon.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   In fact, when I asked you to join us yesterday, you said,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   "Okay, but I might be called away."
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   >> Yeah, it just depended on which direction Gustav took.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Unfortunately, Houston does not appear to be in its sights.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I feel for the folks in Louisiana, but we're fairly
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   grateful here to be missing this one.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   >> Is it bearing down right on New Orleans again?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   >> It's a little bit to the west.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I think the last thing I saw was a grand-dial Louisiana,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   which is a little bit west.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   But of course, the east side of a hurricane is the dirty side.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   >> Right.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> And that's a big concern for them.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   The storm surge supposedly could be larger than Katrina,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   which of course is the thing you really want to worry about
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   for a city like New Orleans.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   >> Oh, boy.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I'll tell you what I'd worry about.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   George Bush is actually there now.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   >> He's --
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> And Cheney.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   >> Where's Brownie?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Where's Brownie?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   >> Where's Brownie?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Where's my buddy Brownie?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   >> Oh, boy.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   It's scary.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's really scary.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   >> He's doing a good job somewhere else.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> He's doing a good job.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> Heck of a job.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> Heck of a job.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Let's see.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Who else is here?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   John Dwight Tom Jim.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> Jim Lauterback of Revision 3.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Hey, Jim.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> Hey, Leo.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   How are you?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   >> It's good because your son Sam is in a submarine so we could
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   have some time with Jim today.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   >> Yeah, actually he's on his way to sleep in the submarine in the
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   bay, which is great.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Go sleep in the submarine for the night.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   >> You said your son to sleep with the fishes?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   There's an old World War II submarine, but it's a Cub Scout
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   outing and they're on their way to go sleep there.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And I have no desire to sleep in the submarine.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> I've been in that sub.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's actually quite cool.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I think it is World War II vintage.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   >> Sounds stuffy.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   >> It is stuffy.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   >> Why does it sound leaky?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> I didn't know they let you sleep on it.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It doesn't submerge, right?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> Well, I think it's partly in the water, but I don't think it
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   goes all the way in.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   >> It's the Pompano or the Pompanito.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   >> Yeah, they've got all these rules.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   The kids aren't supposed to touch any dials or knobs or --
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   >> Right.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   >> Dive!
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   >> And then I'm supposed to eat beans.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   >> Actually, they're no nuts allowed.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   No seeds, no sunflower seeds.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I'm not sure why.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   >> That's probably for allergies, not for --
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   not because sharks like them.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It's kind of interesting because this sub has been maintained
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   just as the Jeremiah O'Brien, which is the liberty ship
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   that's also docked next to it, has been maintained by enthusiasts,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   so it actually can sail.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   >> Yeah, well, maybe they'll need to go out and, I don't know,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   rescue somebody.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   >> It's like the -- you know, the --
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   the enthusiasts -- you know, I think they -- you know, they've
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   saved a lot of locomotives.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   >> That same thing.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   >> I think, yeah, it's exactly the same thing, except I think
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   one of these things must be caused a real fortune to maintain it,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   so, you know, this is like -- it's like a giant yacht.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   >> What?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I doubt they submerge anymore.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   >> No, I don't think it goes anywhere.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I think it just kind of stays there, but you still have to scrape
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   the bottom of it and oil up the engine.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   >> Well, I think the engines work.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I think they keep the engines working, so.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   >> A lot of labor involved.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   >> Oh, man.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   >> Well, it's a labor of love.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I mean, these guys --
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   >> Yeah, they really dig in.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   >> Yeah, it could come in handy when Oregon attacks.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   >> We're ready.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Bring it on, Oregon.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> Here's why I don't -- you remember Gordon Ubanks?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   >> Gordon Ubanks ran some ad tech, and he was a sub-mariner,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   and I'm afraid that if I go on there, I'm going to have nightmares
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   of Gordon.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   >> Gordon Ubanks, what happened to him?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   >> He lives in Monterey.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   >> Yeah, he's down.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   He was running another company called Oblix for a while,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   and I actually talked to him over the last couple years.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   He's doing great.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   >> He's a great guy.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   His first company was -- they did that --
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   >> Sea Basic.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   >> That's right.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And then they did a word processor that was really great.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And then he joined Symantec as CEO, and then they sold out.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Was it Symantec?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   >> Yeah, well, he went to Symantec, and then they sold out.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Well, they bought Peter Norton.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   >> Right.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   >> He was the CEO who bought Peter Norton.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   >> Something to be proud of.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I bought Peter Norton.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   There's a story.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Peter Norton, the guy with a wide tie, who's still on the --
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I think he's still on the boxes, isn't he?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   >> No.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   >> They took him off the box.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   >> They understand that they actually brought in a Peter Norton
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   look alike for the box.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> Tell me.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   >> I remember one of the first to appear.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   >> You don't want to be super.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   >> When I first started reading columns back in the early '80s,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   there were two people that I really liked.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Peter Norton wrote for PC Week, and then there was John de Vorek.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   >> Those are kind of the ones.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Those are the guys you read every week or every other week.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   >> And Norton's book to programming the PC was the book.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I mean, if you wanted to learn how to get into BIOS, and, you know,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   into '13 and all that stuff is actually a great book,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   which I probably still have somewhere.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I'd love to find that.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   But then he sold it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   >> You'd love to find it.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   >> Yeah, because it's memory.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Memory lane, baby.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   >> I'd love to, like, to love to get rid of this stuff.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   >> You probably have a copy.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   You have a copy.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   >> Nobody go up on eBay and get Leo a copy.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   >> Here's the copy of the book that I have that I've been trying.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I want somebody to buy it from me.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   The Macintosh Basic Handbook from Cybex.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   >> That's a piece of history because that program was never
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   released.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Microsoft said to Apple, you released that, were history,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   because Microsoft's basic was the basic, the only basic,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and Mac basic was so much better.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Microsoft was afraid, you know, it was better than it was VB when
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   back when VB was, you know, not, did not exist.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   It was amazing.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And I had a copy of it.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Somebody at Apple had snuck into my hands and I offered it.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   >> Now that's something you should dig up.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   >> I offered it on my BBS for years as a download.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   You know, kind of under the radar, it was great.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   It was a beautiful programming opera environment.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Very much like visual basic.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But yeah, that's a, that's Cybex book.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Did you write that, John?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   >> No.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   >> You just happened to have it.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   >> According to Wikipedia, the Peter Norton Programmer's Guide
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   to the IBM PC was called the Pink Shirt Book because he was
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   wearing a pink shirt on the cover.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   In the third one, pink shirt, second one, white shirt.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But, you know, I remember him with his arms folded and the
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   wide tie on the, on the boxes.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   But he's retired now and just is like, he's a,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   art collector, right?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   >> Yeah, he's basically an art collector and a patron.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   He's a patron of the arts.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Let's move that up a notch.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   >> That should make so much money.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   >> Yeah, you don't, we need to ditch copyright law and just go
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   back to patronage of the arts.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   >> That same Wikipedia entry notes that Peter Norton's
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   crossed arm pose is a registered trademark.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   So nobody crossed their arms because you'd be violating trademark.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   How can they register that?
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That's crazy.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   >> What a crock.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Hey, has the show started yet?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   >> Yes, it has, John C. Devorak.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   You want to talk about some news?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   >> Well, I think maybe that's what people out there want to hear.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   >> I think they'd prefer to hear us reminisce about the battle days
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   of stuff.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   We only have vague memories of that.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   The information is full, full, flawed.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   >> Well, what's different about the modern stuff?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   All right, this is the big story from the Houston Chronicles tech blog,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Comcast's bandwidth caps out of the closet.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   You know, the truth is they've always had bandwidth caps.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Dave Weiner, most famously getting that letter from Comcast some
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   months ago saying you're a hog, we're going to cut you off.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   In fact, they cut you off for a year if they cut you off.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   >> Was that for his Comcast usage?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   >> Oh.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   >> He tweeted about it was a fascinating story.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I think he blogs out.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   >> Is it Joe's getting there?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Some guys out there, some of my fans will get that one.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   >> Oh, that's, oh, I can't.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   >> Nevermind, go on.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   >> I see.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   That was a little dig.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   >> No, just kidding.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   >> I love him.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I'm a kid.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So they say October 1st, you get 250 gigabytes a month.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   They point out that that only 1% of all their users use that much.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   In fact, the vast majority use 1/100 of that.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   It's much more typical.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   The average usage is 2 to 3 gigabytes a month.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   >> What?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   >> Can I bring up a point to the listeners out there and that probably
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   might be good on Twitter?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   >> Yes.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   >> Somebody out there develop a small utility that essentially counts the
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   bits that we use when we go online.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Because you can do that as you can just do a little interrupt in the middle
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   between the connection and the computer.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And let's see what people really do use.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   >> Well, there are a lot of them.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   >> Netmeeter.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   >> Netmeeter.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   >> Is there a counter out there?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   >> Yeah, there's tons of them.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   >> There are.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   >> What's interesting is that Comcast, when asked whether they were
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   going to provide one, because if they're going to tell you you can only have so much,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   they ought to tell you how much you're using.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   They said no go out and do a search for them.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   There are others out there.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And to me, they have a moral imperative to say if we're going to cap you,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   we need to tell you what you're doing.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   You need to be able to go to their account page on their site and it should
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   say right next to your bill, how much you view it.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   >> Yeah, thanks.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   >> It's just like the self-contourness.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   >> Yeah, but here's the problem with all of this.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I've got five computers at home that are online right now, but I also have
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   three other devices that I can't load anything onto.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   >> Like your sling box, for instance.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   >> Like my sling box, my Sonos, and I don't know, Lord knows there's four or five.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   >> The router can do the counting.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   >> Yeah, especially if your router doesn't do the counting, you can flash it
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   with like the tomato firmware or DDWRT and then it can do the counting for you.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   >> But still think Comcast knows they're the only ones who really can easily know all of this.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   >> You shouldn't have to go flash the firmware on your router to see who you are.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   >> They're going to get sued by somebody if they don't provide this information because the fact of the
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   matter is you can't charge for somebody and Ted just take their word for it.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   This is like going to the gas station and putting the pump in and not having any
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   gallonage and they just say, "Yeah, you owe me 50 bucks."
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   >> Well, the same day that this broke, there also was a settlement in Florida, which Comcast
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   actually lost this civil suit, I mean a suit from the Florida Attorney General in which they
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   basically charged that Comcast was not playing fair by having the spanned with cap but not
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   talking about it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   That was announced the same day as this and so I suspect that that may have had something to do with it
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and they have actually had to rush this out.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   >> They clearly, I mean they clearly had kind of unwritten caps.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   The question is, is this artificially low and here's my contention, the real point of doing this
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and doing it now, right now, nobody, it's not a very small number of people who get bit by this.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I did some calculating, if you for instance wanted to watch my video stream, which is a very high
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   quality, 564 kilobits stream, if you watch it 24/7, you'd only use 176 gigabytes a month.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   >> But Leo, you've got to look at some other things out there as well.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   I also did some calculations based on one of our program's dig nation, which takes about,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   it's almost a gigabit, a gigabyte per hour.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   So if you think about it, if you're watching eight hours of television a day, which is what the
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   normal American household apparently does, something like that, across 30 days, you're going to
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   pretty much bump up against that just by watching eight hours of internet television a day at that
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   level and that's not even HD level.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   >> So here's my problem with that, let me tack it on real quickly, Leo, is if you go over
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   your limit, all you get is a warning and then once you've been warned, if you go over again,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   they suspend you for a year.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   You can't even buy extra capacity.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   >> It's just, no, you have to stay under 250, change your life because you don't have much.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   >> Well, hey, does this happen to anybody that we know of?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   >> It doesn't start till October 1st.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   >> Well, as I said, it happens to people.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   >> It has happened to people.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   >> There's no way they're going to do that.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   That's not going to happen.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   >> They've done it.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   >> They've run it to people.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   >> They've done it to people who have run afoul of the cap before they formally said what it
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   was.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   This cap has been in place for several years and every now and then if you look on broadband
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   or port, you'll see stories about people who, yes, had their service cut off because they
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   continually went over it.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Now, I don't know that it was just two times in your out.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   It may have been more than that, but now they're making some formal rules starting October 1st.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.840]   So here's my conspiracy theory.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.560]   I think they're doing this now for a very clear reason.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.000]   Right now, we're going to bitch in Moam, but most customers aren't even close to that.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.640]   It's a safe thing to do, but I say they're saying, let's draw the line in the sand now.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.880]   Nobody's downloading eight hours of high quality video today, but in a couple of years, three
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.640]   years, four years, they are.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.600]   And what is Comcast's primary business?
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.800]   It's a cable company.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.720]   I think what this really is is anti-competitive.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.800]   I think they're saying, we don't want people to start watching TV.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.240]   We don't want them to start watching revision three, eight hours a day because that puts
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.240]   us out of business.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.280]   We don't want them downloading high diff movies.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.200]   It's the same thing as saying we don't want voice over internet because we've got our
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   own call system.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   Can I defend?
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.600]   Or transition play where they're saying, we'll wait until people start to hit the 250 gig
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.680]   max and then we'll start making a more expensive tier they can go to.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.280]   So we make up that money and we might be losing from cable.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.280]   Right.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.720]   Look at the company with another argument.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.200]   Okay.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.160]   First of all, there's a lot of evidence that IPTV initiatives are being looked at closely
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:35.440]   by Comcast and at some point they may bail on the cable business and do IPTV with a package
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.520]   kind of deal, which essentially is like cable, but it would probably save them a ton of money.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.000]   So I'm not convinced that they're doing this to kill IPTV, although it's a really good argument.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.560]   The other thing is they keep raising their speeds and at some point they're going to
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:55.600]   run into kind of an end point where they're not going to be able to do any practical speed
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.640]   raising without changing their whole infrastructure.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.040]   And I think what they're doing here is setting up some sort of essentially a marketing gimmick
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:11.400]   where they put this fairly high cap up and then at some point down the road when they
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:17.000]   have no other leverage to say we have a better deal than AT&T or whoever they say, now we
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.640]   will give you 500 gigabytes.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:25.320]   And then now we'll give you a terabyte a month and then pretty much maintain the same price
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   structure.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.040]   I don't think they're going to go into price gouging because there's no evidence that they
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.400]   can maintain that because there's just enough of a modicum of competition to prevent that
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   from happening.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   Well, that's the issue.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.120]   Is there, if there were competition, nothing to worry about, right?
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.680]   Then you just say, well, Comcast has a 250 gig limit.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:48.080]   I'll just go to my local independent internet service provider except that for most people
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   there isn't one.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.960]   Or even if it is one, it's at a much lower level.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.360]   I mean, I just left DSL.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.920]   I loved my DSL ISP to death, but they couldn't provide me more than 150k.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.400]   They just couldn't wear it.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.200]   Why don't you live in Berkeley or something like that?
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.600]   I live in downtown Oakland.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   Oh, I say, thank you.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.400]   Oh, that's not the same.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.240]   Are you kidding me?
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.120]   In a lot of cases, there are two providers.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.000]   There are, usually AT&T or some telco and there's the cable company.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.120]   AT&T has also said that they are looking at bandwidth caps.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:30.280]   Time Warner just down the road in Beaumont is trialing a metered usage based on bandwidth
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.280]   caps.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.840]   So this is something that's coming everywhere and my suspicion is you're not going to be
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.840]   able to escape.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.920]   Oh, wait, time Warner, first of all, is more scared than anybody else.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.080]   They're like, they're the, they're the ostrich of the cable company.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   So ignore them.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.320]   It would be more interesting to see what happens with Verizon and Comcast where they compete
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.960]   in the same place and Fios is going in because there, I think, is where Comcast is going
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.680]   to get their shirt handed to them.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.460]   If Verizon doesn't put gas on, but, but, but, they, they will, they will, they will,
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.080]   is primarily in new suburbs.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.200]   They're not putting it into a very expensive.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.400]   It's putting it in Manhattan.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.200]   Yeah, but it's very, well, the T in Manhattan, when there's dense populations, it's relatively
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   cheap.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.400]   So $5,000 per subscriber in, in places in suburbs and places where houses are independent of
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   individual houses.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.000]   Well, actually the best bet for that is to do a new, new developments.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.480]   Jim, you're never going to get fiber to your house.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.760]   He's in, he lives on like on the ocean.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.800]   There's not fiber in my house.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   Does that count?
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   You do.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   No.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   I read fiber when we put it in an edition.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   What?
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   What are you nuts?
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.600]   You know, I got that banana peel cable that had two strands of UTP, two strands of cable
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.600]   and a five.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.600]   Just so I could say I did it on twin.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.000]   It's a good thing to have.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And now it's paid off.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.480]   Now, we're actually running, you know, at Port Angeles house, we're running fiber to
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.480]   that.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.480]   But we paid for the trench.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.760]   Yeah, and it's expensive, isn't it?
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.520]   Well, actually they were strung it overhead and it wasn't that expensive.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   All right.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.720]   We, like, we looked at a trenching out to our house and it was kind of was a hundred dollars
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   of foot or something.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.280]   It was somehow a rages amount.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   Huge.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:09.280]   Really fiber cable DSL where they do have a high speed and Y max or LTE or something,
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.800]   you know, in the future all competing against each other.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.000]   I think it's possible, but it's going to take forever.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.440]   That's the essential problem is that even if you have an independent internet service
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.440]   provider in your neighborhood, they're getting it from the telco.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.880]   So essentially, no, no, that's not true necessarily.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.040]   We're not getting our fiber from the telco.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.280]   Well, who are you getting it from?
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.640]   We're getting it from the public utilities district.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.640]   Really?
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.640]   That's interesting.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.640]   That's an outlier.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.840]   No, there's a lot of public utilities districts that have fiber.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.560]   Most of the country is wired up and they got all this excess.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.560]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   And they own.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.560]   Well, that's good.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.560]   Let's promote that.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.560]   I mean, the more competition, the better.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.400]   I just think in most markets, if you're lucky, you've got two big, you got the telco
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.320]   and you got the cable company and they're going to collude.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.520]   Here's my, here's my proposition.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.040]   Let's not have bandwidth caps.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.120]   I don't mind paying for more speed.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.880]   I think you should pay for more speed, but it should always be unlimited.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.880]   Is that viable?
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.880]   Does that work, Jim Laffer?
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.880]   Yeah, there's an idea.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.880]   Pay by the bit.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.120]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.120]   Not by the bit.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   You're not paying for data.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   Pay by speed.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.120]   Pay by speed.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.920]   So if I get the speed.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   Say again.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   Get the speed.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.480]   That's the other problem is that Comcast claims, these people claim you're going to get,
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.480]   you know, two megabits.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   Right.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   Or you don't get it.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.080]   No, but I think, I think as a consumer, I'd be willing to, you know, tear me.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.800]   So if I'm not a big user, give me two megabits.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.120]   But if I want to start downloading high def video or start watching streaming video,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.840]   I want 10 megabits.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.000]   I pay for that.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.800]   But it's got to be on AT&T does.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.760]   That's what AT&T does now at DSL is tiered.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.400]   But traditionally cable has not been.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.080]   Well, you can get, you can get a more expensive account from at least some cable operators.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.160]   It'll give you more of a slightly corporate thing.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.640]   We did this for one of our video creators down in LA who I'd upload a show every week.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.120]   I just don't, I don't want limits.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.560]   It's, you can't measure how much you've downloaded.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.960]   It's an unpredictable amount.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.320]   And I don't want limits on what I can watch.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.280]   I know how much bandwidth I'm getting.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.640]   I can check that at any time.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.600]   I know if I'm getting my money's worth.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.040]   And I think that that's a much more reasonable way to play it.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.880]   And I think consumers be, I mean, then, you know what you're getting.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.200]   I'm getting four megabits.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.200]   I'm getting it.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.120]   What about then surfside of like a minimum, like a, you know, like a service level agreement?
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.320]   Like we will provide you this much.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.720]   It might go higher sometimes.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   I think that's reasonable.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   The positions are right.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   You're guaranteed this.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   Now they tell you the maximum.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.520]   They say you may get as much as 10 megabits.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.800]   And you can only go as high as 250 gigabits.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.880]   Minimals are much better.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:45.080]   This is kind of the conversation we had before, John, where we were debating what is the actual
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.520]   cost of this bandwidth to the provider.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   And I still like attention.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.920]   Oh, and now here we go into the theoretical that's all free argument.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   All right.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.920]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   I get a bunch of hate mail because I still think that it should be done.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.720]   And you know what my argument is.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.320]   Do you, you don't really want people to pay for the by the bit though.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.400]   And yeah, I do.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.720]   He likes the way it was back in 1996.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.880]   I'd see paying by the bit makes no sense to me.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.120]   I can understand paying.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.880]   Look, understand, we have to pay for the infrastructure, John.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.920]   I'm not saying we don't have to pay for something, but, but, but it makes more sense to me that
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.660]   I pay for the speed I get, not for the bits.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.020]   But we really don't want us pay for the bits because that gives them a chokehold on the
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.660]   content that we get.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.660]   They're essentially condensed.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:35.560]   Yes, it does because I, if I'm getting 250 gigs limit, I can't download high def movies.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.000]   I can't do all the things I'd like to do.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.160]   Leo, here's what I would get.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.700]   What you, what everybody assumes when they take on this argument with me is that that
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:48.620]   for some reason that calculation is going to result in some horrendous fees for normal
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.620]   usage.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.840]   I'm saying that you should be able to download all the movies you want by the bit and pay
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.560]   like 12 bucks a month.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   Okay.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.400]   I could, I could dig that.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   Do you think that's what's going to happen?
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:06.920]   Well, no, because it's already the, the, the amount of, of the number of people that are
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.880]   against the idea and the fact that we've done it some other way for so long and the fact
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.080]   that every time you turn around one of these guys is going to offer something like, no,
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.320]   we don't should do it that way.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.520]   No, it's never going to happen.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.180]   The problem is that they, if you pay by the bit, they still have another dial they can
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.740]   turn, which is the speed.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.820]   So they say, okay, yeah, you buy by the bit, but I want to turn your speed down because
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.820]   I don't want you to.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.900]   I think it should be the maximum amount of speed that you can possibly get by the bit.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.060]   Well, I could live with that.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.980]   If the, if the price of per bit, in a way, that makes more sense because you're buying,
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.260]   let's say you buy a high def movie and it's two gigabyte download, you know exactly what
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.260]   the cost of that movie is going to be.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.500]   You know, if it's a penny, a penny a megabyte, it's two, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.500]   that is.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.200]   Two thousand, then all your VISTA machines wake up at midnight and download the whole
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   operating.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.040]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   We got a, yeah.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.880]   We got an email from a family of four and the guy is really worried about the two 50
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.720]   gigabyte cap because he says he's got, you know, Xbox 360 and he's got four computers,
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.960]   one for each of his kids and he and his wife and they're all patching and they do backup.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.120]   So they upload a backup every week.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.120]   That's, you know, several gigabytes.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.460]   He's like, I'm pretty sure I'm going to go over that 250 gigabyte max in a month.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.260]   Get two accounts.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.260]   Get two accounts.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.980]   Well, they run a second wire because that's an interesting idea, but you have, you, you
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.500]   got to run a second wire, wouldn't you?
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.500]   They wouldn't.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.500]   Yeah, they could run a second wire.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.500]   They got the little thing.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.020]   But they do that though because one of the things right now is that what happens when
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.100]   you have a duplex and you got two people in the, and live in there separately.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.980]   Usually they've run all those wires by now.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.980]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.980]   Right.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.980]   That's not, no, no, they'll run a wire.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.420]   They'll charge you for it though.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.420]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.720]   So you get to go on those free installation deals.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:49.280]   Well, they don't do free installation anymore unless you get triple play, at least for Comcast.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.280]   It comes and goes.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.240]   I think people don't need to worry right now.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.120]   I think there are very few people who are actually going to hit that 250 gig.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.720]   That's a pretty big limit.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   But Leo, you're right.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.640]   It's setting it up for the future at that point.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.560]   I think it's going to be a real problem going forward.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.200]   And I think, you know, it's, it's going to keep people from doing things like watching
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.820]   high bandwidth movies or television shows because they're afraid of hitting that cap,
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.020]   even though they'll never get there.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.420]   They're afraid of it.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:20.700]   And once Comcast starts offering the same kind of thing, you watch those bits will be
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.380]   exempt from their cap.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.180]   Walgarden, Walgarden.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.380]   So if you go to fan cast right now, that's not going to count.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.980]   Don't know right now, but you're right.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   That's how bad you're right.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.180]   You guys, somebody listening to you guys would think you're all hallucinating.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.680]   You're kind of making up scenarios that we have no evidence to exist.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.880]   Well, John, we're not saying they do exist.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.480]   We're saying what could happen as a result of this.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   All kinds of things.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.200]   I'm saying over and beat the crap out of you and steal your money.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.720]   I'm saying, what's your wallet?
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.680]   I'm saying they're going after it.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.960]   I remember talking to cable companies and that sucking sound Leo.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.360]   Raise your hand.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   Raise your hand.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.320]   I got a crazy headline in the basement.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.720]   I talked to the cable companies.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.100]   Actions gone by.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.520]   I talked to the cable companies and they said very clearly, I said, look, you got to see
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.440]   yourself as content agnostic.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.400]   Really your future is you're a data provider and whatever is on that bit is on that bit.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.300]   They said our business model doesn't work that way.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.320]   We have to charge for premium content.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.800]   That's how we make our money.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.860]   If we just charge by the bit, it's going to cost way too much.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.860]   I think that that's what they see.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.780]   By premium content over IPTV a lot easier than they can do it now.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.780]   Well, can they?
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.060]   Is the FCC going to let them?
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.340]   The FCC doesn't even have any control over it.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.740]   Well, the FCC doesn't want them crazy without the FCC.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.460]   No, I'm saying, well, they do have control over it.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.500]   In fact, that's why they slapped Comcast on the wrist.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.060]   They said you can't prioritize content.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.540]   Yeah, they don't have right.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.540]   They bitched.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.100]   Yeah, they didn't do anything to them.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.100]   But I think they do.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.700]   Right now somebody in the chat room just pointed out something they prioritize.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.620]   Boy, it's coming over the same pipes.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.020]   It doesn't count against this 250 gigabyte cap.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.300]   They're providing telephone service.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.540]   So what's the difference if they change their cable service to be over IP?
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.900]   And they say, oh, no, that's different than your internet.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.660]   We prioritize that and pay for it separate.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.780]   So John, you're saying, you're a temperature team.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:14.860]   Let's wait and see what they do.
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:15.860]   You trust the cable.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.580]   Yeah, I'd rather than be jumping all over these guys like you hate them.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.700]   I think we should wait and see what happens and then bitch.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:26.900]   I mean, bitch, after the fact and make them correct it as opposed to this kind of moaning
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.540]   that I keep hearing, which is like, you know, like old women.
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:35.620]   I just worry because we're moving very fast to an era where rich media is delivered over
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.620]   the internet.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.660]   You know, Jim, your big time involved in that business.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.220]   I'm doing it.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.700]   Tom Merritt working for CBS joint.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.420]   You're doing it.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.420]   You know, it's this is this is the future is this rich media over the internet.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.620]   This is the distribution medium we've chosen.
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:55.660]   Well, and with my wife working at home sometimes, uploading video up for her job at revision
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:00.100]   three and then me working at home sometimes and streaming video and then just doing entertainment,
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.620]   I'm worried I might come up across that 250 gigabyte cap and then I have no alternative.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.220]   I can't say, yeah, yeah, okay, I'll pay a little extra.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.020]   Tom, are you a Comcast?
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.020]   Are you a Comcast?
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.180]   Yeah, I just switched over to Comcast just a month ago.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:19.020]   I don't know the fact you don't know how many bits you're consuming and that you could get
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:24.180]   in trouble if you consume too many means that people will change their behavior, even
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.180]   if they aren't getting close to a limit.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.460]   And that's what I'm concerned about is not it's not the reality.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.700]   Well, Jim, would you feel, Jim, would you feel better if they would come up with some
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.260]   scheme where you'd know?
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.140]   I'd feel better.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.380]   I mean, your concern is that there's all a big mystery and they're just going to, you
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.780]   know, all of a sudden, I bet they do that.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.820]   I bet they put that on the people are going to all back off because they're scared to
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.820]   have to.
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.820]   They put that on your homepage.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.900]   You've used a hundred gigabytes of your total 250.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.900]   I'm sure they're going to do that.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.100]   Yeah, just like the, just like the cell companies will show you the number of minutes you've
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.660]   used for your whole family.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.060]   I think they'll do the same thing.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.180]   I think, like I said earlier, I think they morally they have to.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.180]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.740]   But, and then they'll upsell you with a tier, which is the only, the only smart thing to
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.740]   do.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.740]   Right.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.740]   So good news.
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.460]   You can now get your captures solved for just $2 for a thousand solved captures.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.460]   That story coming up in just a bit.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.500]   But first, I want to tell you, if you're going to pay for your solved captures online,
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.500]   you don't want to pay cash.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.620]   You don't want to use PayPal.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:26.940]   You want to use your Visa card because when you shop online with Visa, every purchase
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.660]   is safe.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:33.740]   Visa prevents, detects and resolves online fraud with very sophisticated software, keeps
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.220]   an eye on what you're buying and lets you know if there's a problem.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.700]   Bottom line is zero liability.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.660]   You're just not liable for unauthorized purchases.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:47.260]   When you shop online or off, make sure you take along your Visa card for safe, secure
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.260]   transactions.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.220]   That's peace of mind.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.220]   It's Visa.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.180]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.780]   So you predicted this, John.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:04.380]   There are companies in India, which will solve captures for you, you know, who wants to do
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.380]   this?
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:10.660]   We'll spammers who want to get free accounts on Google mail and Yahoo mail.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.020]   Captures solving companies.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:19.740]   This is from an article by a Dancho Denchev in the ZDNet blog, Zero Day.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.740]   They're cheap too.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.460]   250,000 solved captures a day, two bucks per thousand.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.340]   So $500 a day.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:32.060]   A thousand international workers actively soliciting deals for breaking Craigslist, Gmail, Yahoo,
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.460]   MySpace, YouTube and Facebook's capture.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.460]   This is the way to do it.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:42.180]   Who needs these automated capture solving robots when humans are cheap?
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.620]   I think you predicted this, John.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.620]   John?
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.620]   Is John okay?
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.620]   John?
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.140]   John with Tom, Tom, Tom, I think he hit his bomb bandwidth cap.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.140]   Don't bother me.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.140]   I'm solving captures.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.900]   I want a bumper sticker moving along.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.660]   I guess that story just put him right out.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.660]   I think he passed out.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.660]   I don't know what happened.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.100]   He probably ran to sign up for it.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.100]   Speaking of areas.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.100]   Back now.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.100]   Did you turn the roast?
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:18.100]   I had to go grab a DVD that was in the, it was just, so I had to do, take care of
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.100]   some technology.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.100]   I'm watching movies.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.100]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.100]   I'm watching movies.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.260]   You always go to me.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.420]   You have some seconds.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.140]   I think you've got us like a little indicator.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.820]   I leave them within more of a foot away from the mic.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.820]   You're on me.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.820]   I do.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.820]   I could tell.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.820]   So John, what do you think about the, what do you think?
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.820]   He's not here.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.460]   You thought, no, you thought it's time for a commercial.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.020]   Leo goes on and on and on.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.580]   I've got at least five minutes and you took off.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.180]   That's how I understand that.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.180]   We do this show.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.180]   People may not know.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.100]   By the way, you can watch us as we do it live at live.twit.tv.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.740]   We do it live 3 p.m. Sunday's Pacific time.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.900]   John's usually making a roast.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:57.900]   He's cooking Sunday dinner.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:58.900]   He's busy.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.180]   Got the barbecue fired up.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.480]   Something's going on.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.140]   So I understand that.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.780]   We can't expect you to be 100% here.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.780]   So what was the question?
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.780]   Nothing.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.780]   It doesn't matter now.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.820]   Usually, Patrick's repairing his car.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.820]   So it's okay.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.020]   Patrick's always going off the air too.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.420]   At least you're not under a car or something.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.940]   Tom Anderson, you know, Tom, when you join Myspace, you get one friend free.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.500]   That's Tom.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.660]   He's Tom Anderson, the guy who created one of the guys who created Myspace.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:31.260]   Turns out he was a hacker.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:37.180]   When he was 14 in 1985, high school student in Escondido, he was subject to one of the
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:42.060]   largest FBI raids in California history.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:46.260]   He hacked into Chase Manhattan Bank.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.260]   And showed his friend how to do it.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.980]   He wasn't arrested because he was 14.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:54.340]   By the way, I can remember Kevin Polson and Kevin Mitnick both telling me they both got
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:59.220]   caught when they were underage, got let go and of course continued their life of crime
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.620]   and ended up doing jail terms.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:07.420]   Tom, I guess, learned his lesson and started to nice Myspace instead.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.020]   You know, Tom is not my friend, actually.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.420]   Tom's not your friend.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.100]   I joined before they foisted him on everyone.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.100]   Oh, you're a old timer.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.020]   Oh, can you get rid of Tom?
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.020]   Can you get rid of him?
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.940]   I could go a request at my guess.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.540]   No, no, request.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.020]   My son asked me about every, my son is also 14.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.420]   He asked me about every five minutes.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.060]   You know how to hack high space, right?
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.060]   Because he thinks, I don't know.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.060]   He thinks because I'm a tech guy.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.140]   I don't know how to hack.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.820]   Can you hack Tom's account?
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.820]   He said everybody could do it.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.820]   Can you hack Tom's account?
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.780]   I said, I'm not going to hack Tom's account.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.220]   You know what Tom's handle was?
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.220]   I like it.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.220]   Lord Flathead.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.860]   Now, what is the proximity of his hacking case and war games?
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.540]   Because they made a lot of it in that article.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.860]   It's not like he inspired it, right?
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.620]   No, I don't think so.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.660]   I think it's just, you know, that was something they could hang there.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.660]   I went and war games came.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.660]   Let me check IMDB.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.660]   When it was.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.660]   It came out in '85, right?
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.660]   Did it?
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.660]   And not about right.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.660]   I'm in the world.
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.660]   I'm in the world there.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.660]   83.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.660]   OK, so he was inspired by war games.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.460]   I remember interviewing John Badum, the guy who directed it.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.220]   You know, it's funny because work 83.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.300]   I mean, the Mac hadn't even come out yet.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.780]   The IBM PC was two years old.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.820]   We were using DOS, you know, five.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.620]   My cousins left Elbow is in that movie.
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:27.860]   He worked at one of the Air Force bases where they shot my left elbow.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.020]   Wasn't that didn't that was my left elbow?
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.260]   Yeah, how can you be sure?
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.060]   He always claimed.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.060]   I don't know.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.780]   So, Leo, when this when he was hacking into chase, I was actually working at chase at
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.780]   the time.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.780]   No.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.020]   And I don't know.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.300]   I don't know what I had an it was an internship in school.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:51.860]   I don't know what deck of Vax he hacked into, but it was not a deck of acts shop.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.220]   This was all IBM mainframe.
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:55.860]   Oh, so maybe this is BS.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.540]   Well, you know, they could have been like a little vaccine somewhere and like a little
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:05.180]   corner that was, I don't know, tabulating something, but it was not a big part of the
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.380]   corporate network.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.140]   It was all there was a priesthood of IBM mainframe.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.380]   And I had to deal with them.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.380]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:17.100]   According to Mike Harrington's article and tech crunch, Anderson, who was in between his
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.940]   freshman, sophomore, years in high school, I wish my kids had this much initiative.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:27.580]   Hacked into although I wouldn't want the FBI task force battering the door down, but
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:32.420]   hacked into the Chase Manhattan's Vax, the one that quote handled much of Chase's data
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.820]   processing and record keeping, including records of home mortgages and portfolios of major
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.860]   customers such as pension funds.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.860]   Seems unlikely.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.860]   Doesn't sound.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.860]   I don't know.
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.500]   You know, all the check processing, which is where I was, was all on really big IBM.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.140]   I think this might be bogus.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.860]   It doesn't sound right.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:54.420]   But, but wait a minute, is Tom such a good hacker that he was able to place this story
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.740]   back in 1985 somehow, places into the archives?
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.900]   Maybe maybe that's the real hack.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:00.900]   Maybe not.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.900]   John Tylton.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.820]   Or it could be that the police who who talked to the reporters from the story back then
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.540]   didn't know their Vax from there on the end.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.540]   I think that's probably the case.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.540]   No, that's possible.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.220]   And then what about the guy who disappeared that they interviewed Tom about?
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.220]   Landrance?
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.140]   Like later down in the story.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   Hmm.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.140]   Who apparently disappeared.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.340]   They never found it, but then something else turns up that he worked for the CIA or something.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.780]   I mean, it just gets weirder and weirder.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.780]   The farther into that story.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.780]   It might be.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.780]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.940]   It's, you know, they're doing a, they're doing a movie on Facebook.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:35.180]   I think they should do a movie on my space and maybe that's why this article came out.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.180]   Lord Flathead.
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.180]   Lord Flathead.
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:47.700]   Lord Flathead is a character in a colossal cave in adventure.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.060]   Oh, that's right.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.900]   Somebody in this group would know.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.740]   So if Aaron Sorkin's doing Facebook, then who should direct the MySpace story, the Tom
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.740]   Anderson story?
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:58.740]   Oh, really?
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.220]   Or Aaron Sorkin's doing a, is it a show or a movie about Facebook?
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.220]   It's a movie.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.100]   You don't know if it's a fiction movie or a documentary or a docu-drama or what?
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:12.300]   You know, who is that guy who did the, uh, McGee autodirect of MySpace?
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:18.380]   The guy who did the, uh, the, uh, movies that were based on, uh, Charlie's Angels.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.380]   That's how it goes.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.380]   How about Mel Brooks?
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:26.620]   I like the idea of Aaron Sorkin doing a television series about, you know, just as he did West
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:31.380]   Wing, but instead about being about the White House, being about a social network, uh,
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.900]   razzmataz, hotshot, young guys.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.620]   Does anybody think this is going to remotely be entertaining?
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.700]   No, no, it will be because it will be completely fictional.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.260]   If it were anything like the real thing, it would be un-entertaining, but it, but you
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.260]   know, they'll fictionalize.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.260]   They'll, they'll add high drama.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:51.100]   It's going to have a lot of it'll happen at Harvard and there'll be a lot of sex.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.260]   And they have a built-in audience of millions of people who are addicted to Facebook.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.140]   Oh, wait a minute, Mark.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.140]   Stop the servers down.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.140]   Oh my God.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.900]   How will I get laid tonight?
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:03.900]   I know.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.460]   I'll start a computer program.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.660]   Have you, you, who's, you, somebody here must have met Zuckerberg.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:09.660]   Oh yeah.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.660]   What's, what's, they say he's very shy.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.620]   He's a nice little, he's a nice guy.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.620]   Nice little guy.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.620]   What is it?
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.620]   A little, nice little boy.
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.620]   There he is.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.620]   And there's a lot.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:24.220]   I got, I got Mark Zuckerberg right here in my pocket.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.220]   Um, what, what, you know what?
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.220]   He's smart.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.180]   He's a, he's a nice guy.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.140]   How would you draw us a, draw us a picture of him?
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.940]   How would you characterize him as he, uh, you see, you think he's real bright, you
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.460]   could tell he's real bright, right?
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.460]   Huh?
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.100]   I would say he's more Woody Allen than Tom Cruise.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.100]   Ah, nerd.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.100]   Debi, Sean.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.100]   Well, maybe it'd be a comedy.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.100]   Mel Brooks.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.100]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.940]   Maybe it is Mel Brooks.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.740]   Well, that's, yeah, for Facebook.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.740]   The save is down.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.740]   Hey.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.980]   You need to, you need to, Oliver Stone for my experience.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.380]   That, that's your Woody Allen?
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.780]   No, that's not Woody Allen.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.780]   That's Woody Allen directing Mel Brooks.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.380]   Uh, it sounded more like a little bit of young Frankenstein.
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.380]   Mel Brooks.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.980]   I was going with the Mel Brooks.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.220]   Young Facebook Stein.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.580]   Excuse me while I code this out.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.220]   My name is Zuka Bogg.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.140]   Uh, let's see.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.860]   Apple's being sued three different ways from sunrise.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.900]   The biggest one, the most interesting one anyway, is Sigh Stars countersuit.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:29.940]   Now, Sigh Stars, a company that made the Apple clone that Apple, for a while, put up with,
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   but finally shut down.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.020]   How does they brick them?
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.860]   Uh, that's a good question.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.140]   It just says that in the headline.
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.740]   I'm not quite sure.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.580]   Did anybody ever touch one of these machines?
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.580]   No, yes.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:44.580]   Yes, we have one.
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.580]   I've seen it.
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.580]   No, no.
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.820]   Does it work?
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.820]   Yep.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.820]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.820]   It runs Apple.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.540]   You better not run system update.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.220]   I mean, you have to go through their system update, but other than that.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:00.420]   So according to Sigh Star, Apple illegally destroys competition.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.940]   I guess the way they would brick it is if you ran Windows Update, it would brick your,
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.900]   your, your clone, of course.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:08.900]   Windows update?
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.940]   Oh, I was going to let that pass.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.340]   What is the other company?
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.900]   Uh, OS 10 update.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.900]   Apple.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.700]   I guess what they're saying is it bricks it because you can't.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.700]   You can't.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.860]   Put in that kernel, right, whatever the EFI thing is so that you can't install it without
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.860]   a hack.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.860]   Is there merit?
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.100]   I mean, there might be some merit to this.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:34.340]   I mean, it says they violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by engaging in anti competitive
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.900]   behavior in violation of public policy underlying copyright laws.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.540]   Well, they've got to define Apple as their own market.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.540]   That's what they're trying to do.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.660]   They're not part of the PC market.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.820]   They are a separate market unto themselves and therefore a monopoly.
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.580]   That's really hard to convince a judge.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.460]   You can say that about any company.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.460]   I got it.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.100]   No, I got another thing.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.940]   Let's say the following.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.500]   This is what I would equate it to.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.340]   I've got my car and I bought the whole car from some dealer who only sells bridge stone
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.100]   tires and I take it back into my bought fire stones.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.100]   You know, I didn't outside the dealer.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.780]   Like I say, you're supposed to be buying your tires from us.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.180]   You didn't buy the bridge stones.
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.140]   I said, I know, can you fix the engine?
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.580]   And instead they take and poke holes in my tire.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.580]   Ha ha ha.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.580]   They brick it, brick it.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.140]   Now, that's I think that's exactly the analogy that size stars attorney should make.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.020]   I think that's very reasonable.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.860]   Well, the problem with the issue that they're having.
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.860]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.060]   Let me finish one more thought, which is why do I buy a piece of equipment from somebody?
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.020]   What right does Apple have to wreck my piece of equipment?
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.580]   Well, they didn't.
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.620]   They just provided a system update that didn't work.
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.620]   It's not.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.620]   It's not there.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.620]   You weren't using it on the right machine.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:43.660]   I mean, you know, if you've hacked something to work on something else, you can't expect
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:44.860]   them to support the hack.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.180]   They're not supposed to wreck my machine.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:52.220]   The problem with the argument that size stars trying to make that there that it's its own
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:57.380]   little market and thus has its own little set of monopolists and people wanting to undo
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:03.420]   that monopoly is that they're trying to separate it from windows, but now Max can run windows
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.900]   and they run them quite well.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:08.420]   And so it really kind of doesn't matter what's on that machine.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.140]   I think that's just a completely bogus argument that wall between them is no longer there.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:17.260]   So they have to prove monopoly for this lawsuit to work within that little market within
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.580]   that little pond that they're arguing as apples.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.140]   Does anybody really care?
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:27.860]   I mean, if you are so inclined to buy a Mac, are you really going to buy something that's
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:28.860]   not a Mac?
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.860]   If it's cheaper, are they cheap?
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.780]   Oh, yeah, they're a lot cheaper.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.780]   Quite a bit.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:34.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.380]   But people want that Mac goodness.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.540]   You know, those Mac people, that's what they want.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.540]   I agree.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:44.100]   Actually, a related story, I'm going to see if I can find it because I didn't bookmark
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:52.020]   it in this, but a story I think was an ours technique of saying how Apple fans give Apple
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.700]   a complete free pass with all the problems Apple has been having.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.380]   They still love their Mac and Tasha's.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.380]   They still love them.
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.140]   I'm not going to say anything bad about Apple.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.140]   And that's the thing.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.500]   The Apple audience are Apple fans.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.500]   I think you're right.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   I think how many people are buying, you know, ugly look in beige boxes and running a less
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.100]   10 on it.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.700]   If you want to run OS 10, you're going to want to run it on that nice expensive Apple hardware.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.260]   But it's easy to run OS 10 on it.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.860]   I think you would see more people because the idea of a triple boot machine that I can
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:26.420]   run Ubuntu, Windows and OS 10 and have them work, you know, across in virtualization,
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.420]   that's fantastic.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.260]   I mean, that's such a useful machine.
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:34.500]   And if the machine itself was cheap enough where I could buy the Windows extra and the
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.480]   OS 10 and still be cheaper than a Mac, I think people would do that.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   And I would.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.480]   And the one's Jim's talking about.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   I would.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.360]   And hardware vendors want to sell the Mac too.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.520]   I talked to Michael Dell a couple of years ago, about a year and a half ago.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.520]   And I mentioned it to him.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.840]   I said, would you sell Mac based computers?
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.500]   If you couldn't, he said, yeah, I'd love to.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.980]   Now you say, uh, Dell built computers running OS 10.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.260]   He wanted to sell machines running OS 10.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.260]   Okay, that's interesting.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.260]   I guess you're right.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.960]   I think if you could walk into a computer store, well, first of all, if there were any computer
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.940]   stores, you would walk into them and you'd see a shrink wrap copy of OS 10 that you could
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:13.760]   then install on any PC, that would be a market.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.760]   I guess you're right.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:23.280]   Or if you could get, for example, OS 10 on an XPS 1330 as a dual boot or as a single boot.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.280]   Yeah, sure.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.880]   When when when you get into an argument with a Mac head about what, you know, Mac's your
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.780]   PC is the eternal argument.
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.840]   The one thing they always come back to is it's the operating system.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.320]   It's the operating system.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.160]   And certainly, you know, they'll argue that the Mac is a better OS than Windows.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.040]   So if you can put that on a sweet piece of hardware like an M1330, wouldn't you want
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.040]   to do that?
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   I would.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.760]   And I take the other side of the story.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.360]   Here's what Apple has to deal with.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.840]   They have to deal with the fact that they don't, they're not now they're selling an operating
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.800]   system into a nonstandard environment that they don't have any control over.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.480]   So they put up some sort of a cool feature that they have only on their own Mac, but
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.680]   nobody else has duplicated for whatever reason, maybe it's just a basic architecture.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.800]   And the thing starts to break on the Dell machine.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.320]   Who do they end up calling?
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:19.160]   Apple ends up with a, having to do a bunch of support in a situation they have no control.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:24.160]   There's no way that this model would ever be of a, have any appeal to that company the
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.160]   way they're oriented.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.040]   And that's exactly what they don't do.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.040]   That's why they don't do it.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.040]   You're right.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.040]   They have control.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.440]   They have to work on a heterogeneous environment that is completely unpredictable.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.060]   So those John supported John, didn't you once write that you thought that Apple was going
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.560]   to dump the Mac OS and go all windows?
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   Don't rub it in.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.760]   It's always somebody like you in the audience.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.520]   John's favorite quote, what is it Emerson or is it Thoreau?
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.000]   I can never remember.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.080]   Yeah, it was Emerson foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little mines.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.080]   Whatever that means.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.200]   You've been, you've been pwned.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.240]   Well, when he, when he wrote that, I did a blog post about it that with a headline,
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.040]   John Devorak is smoking crack.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.560]   I think I saw that one.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.520]   There's a bunch of people that has some nasty remarks.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.600]   I was just throwing it out as a theoretical, interesting possibility.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.840]   You know, though, the discussions we had around that time were, why doesn't Apple offer
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.640]   a shrink wrapped version of OS 10?
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.640]   Right.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.920]   And you said at the time, John, well, compared wallets, who has the bigger wallet?
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   Bill Gates.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.200]   Or Steve Jobs, the guy who sells an operating system or the guy who sells the hardware?
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.280]   No, I agree that it would be nice.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.600]   And I would definitely probably install it.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.520]   Why doesn't Apple do it?
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.040]   It's because of the control thing.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.680]   They can't deal with the customer service issue.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.240]   I think that's huge.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.120]   Support would be out of control.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.120]   Right.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:54.280]   Well, what you just do with Microsoft does, if you buy our operating system.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.440]   Ever answer the phone?
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.760]   And the policy is if you buy the operating system from an OEM, if you buy a Dell, we don't
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.760]   support Windows.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   Dell supports Windows.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:07.080]   But the way they usually do that, if you buy it from, if you buy your Mac from Apple,
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   then they'll support it.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.080]   Then we support it.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.080]   Why not do that?
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   That's the justification for the higher cost.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.800]   Windows support experience is terrible.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.560]   And because it's decentralized, Apple has a great support experience because you go to
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.560]   one place.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:25.920]   And if they spread that out to all these OEMs, it'll ruin that kind of wonderful glow you
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.840]   have from getting Apple support.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.560]   That's why they don't do it.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.680]   The Apple support gives people a glow most of the time?
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.680]   Most of the time.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.840]   I think the genius does.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.000]   I hear a lot of, you know, you hear negatives.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.640]   Everybody's going to have negatives, but I hear a lot of positives.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.640]   I was at the office this morning and I heard a negative guy walking by.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.440]   It's like, genius couldn't fix my heart.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.440]   Fucking genius.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.640]   That's a commodity.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.640]   But that's anecdotal, obviously.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.200]   And remember, Apple's been down this road before.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.680]   We had the power systems back, I don't know, what was it?
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.640]   10 years or so ago.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   And nobody wanted them.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   Nobody bought them.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.640]   Well that's right.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.920]   And then Steve Jobs put a stake in the heart of these clones by saying we're not going
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   to do it anymore.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.720]   You got to say whatever jobs is done, it's been fairly successful.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.880]   Market share for Apple is up dramatically.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:17.240]   Now 20% of laptops in the US or PCs and laptops in the US, 10% worldwide, is pretty
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:21.240]   phenomenal given that they were 3% just a couple of years ago.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.440]   What is the ceiling for that?
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.440]   Are we at the max?
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.440]   Can Apple have a 30%?
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.440]   No, I can't think of it.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.680]   You think they go to 20%?
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.440]   You predicted that, I think.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   40%.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.440]   No, I don't see 40, but I can see them doing 20.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.440]   Push in 20.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.440]   At whose expense?
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.440]   Dell, HP.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.920]   Dell is not in good shape, are they?
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.520]   I think Dell probably could hit a little bit.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   Lenovo for sure.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:48.680]   Yeah, it's going to be out of the consumer market though, because they're not moving
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.560]   into the enterprise yet.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.040]   Until they do that, they're not going to get the...
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.480]   Well then they'll hit HP when they do that.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   They're not doing well globally.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.120]   Who?
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.880]   Apple does not do nearly as well globally as they do in the enterprise.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.080]   Yeah, well that gives them the way I see it.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:06.520]   That's an opportunity for them, because globally people who use the Apple overseas love it.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:14.960]   According to Piper Jaffrey, they actually in April, they actually broke 20%.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:19.160]   He thinks that Apple max count for 21% in the US consumer market.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.400]   Ah, the consumer market.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.880]   It says, "Leaving out business."
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.400]   And business is 60%.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:29.000]   Yeah, business is a huge portion of that.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.680]   So that is probably considerably lower.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.920]   I would say if you include business, it's around 10% and now something like that, which
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:35.920]   is still huge.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.920]   Yeah, because there are businesses that run the Macs.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.520]   Yeah, but they're all artsy-fartsy.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.520]   Oh, hippies.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.520]   Oh, budget hippies.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:47.320]   Yeah, you see them in server rooms a little bit too, but it's still predominantly...
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.760]   No way, don't get me started on that.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.560]   We bought an Apple Sand that is the worst product I've ever...
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.000]   I think it'd be crazy to run a...
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.200]   It's overpriced.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   What makes it better?
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.800]   I don't know why you'd run an Apple server.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   And there's no support.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.640]   The support for it's terrible.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   Tom, ask your wife.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.640]   It's terrible.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.880]   But believe me, I don't have to ask.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.920]   I've heard a few bits about it.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.960]   Does Elaine manage your server room?
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:09.960]   Why would...
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.960]   No, no, no.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:14.040]   We have a storage area network that we use for video editing and audio.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.680]   Oh, she has to deal with that.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.680]   The Sand.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.520]   If it gets more than 80% filled, it crashes.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   That's not good.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:25.360]   And Apple can do nothing about it.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.320]   Do not trust your enterprise to Apple.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.760]   I think Alex uses Sans for all of his video stuff.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.000]   I wonder what he's doing.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Of course he's...
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.040]   Yeah, we're trying to find a cut server and we can't do it.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.240]   I would ask what they're doing over at Pixelcore.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.880]   They're used to living with pain.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.880]   Seriously.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.280]   It's been painful all along.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.760]   Well, you just don't fill it up.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:51.120]   If you buy a 200 terabyte system, you only get 160 terabytes.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   Right.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:56.800]   Well, you occasionally see these stories in the computer press that says, "Oh, Apple's
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.520]   making inroads into the enterprise and the interview somebody."
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:04.080]   And it's inevitably, "Oh, yeah, we got a max over there on that desk over there."
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.680]   And that's about as far as it gets.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.680]   One Mac.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   How about newspapers?
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   Has that changed in the newspaper business?
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.880]   Well, in the newspaper business, we've always used Macs for production.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.880]   Right.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.880]   Layout.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:22.680]   And for layout, except there are some papers that have older proprietary systems, but
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.160]   use it for layout.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:29.040]   What's interesting is at The Chronicle, we have this very cool policy where, rather than
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.440]   them buying notebooks and stacking them up and you check them out to reporters, reporters
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.840]   can buy their own and the company pays for half.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.640]   And more and more people are buying Macs.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   Oh.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:46.600]   And so the reporters toting Macs around and as a result, kind of the support requests to
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.680]   our tea department for Macs are going way up.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:54.480]   In addition, the introduction of the iPhone with the exchange support has got a lot of
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.920]   reporters wanting to use that in the field.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.560]   And so there's beginning to be pressure on our IT group to do iPhones.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.720]   Are they reporting that trouble?
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.880]   I'm sitting in there that way.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:08.440]   Are they reporting trouble with Mobile Me and Exchange?
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   They're not using Mobile Me.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.440]   No, they're not doing it.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.440]   Okay.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:17.480]   So what's interesting is that this is traditionally how the IBM PC made its inroads into corporate
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:23.520]   America, how Windows XP and new operating systems do is that the consumers use them and then
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.040]   they come to their bosses and say, "You know, I like this.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.320]   I want to use this and that pressure builds."
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.320]   That's how it is.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.600]   It is a calc and Excel got in.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:37.480]   But the funny thing is about 20 years ago, I began and I relate this to the fact that
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.960]   I used to work in factories, which kids can't do anymore when I was a student, and always
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.400]   noticed that the master mechanics in these big places always had their own tools.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.640]   And I always believe that people should have their own computers.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.320]   They should have their own computers that they bring to work.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.360]   And so then when they quit, they take the computer with them and they go to the next
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.840]   job and that way the employer doesn't have to deal with having to support all this gear,
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.840]   letting the stuff go bad, crap, having to refurbish things.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:08.360]   I mean, it just seems to me to like a burden on an employer.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.920]   And besides that, I like what I like.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.920]   I actually do that.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:17.440]   I have a laptop, a thinkpad that was issued to me by CNET, but I use it for testing or
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.440]   some video work.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:24.360]   I bought my own MacBook Pro that I run Windows and NOS 10 on because that way I can do whatever
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.640]   I want on it.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.120]   It's not got some kind of installed thing from the company on it.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:33.000]   And if I ever do leave, I take it with me and I've got all my settings and everything
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   just the way I want it.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.320]   Yeah, try taking that into CBS corporate and see what happens.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.400]   It's in CBS right now.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.880]   What I mean is if you, I don't know about CBS, but I remember when I was doing stuff
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:50.080]   at NBC or MSNBC, they were so locked down, you couldn't plug anything into the network
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.080]   at all.
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.080]   That's an approve.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.800]   Most big enterprises are still that way.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:58.520]   Yeah, that's to me, even though I'm familiar with companies like Altiris and some of these
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:02.560]   guys who made these systems that when you put an alien machine on the network, bang,
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:07.960]   bang, bang, it would be sent to the IT department and you'd actually, actually couldn't get
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.680]   on a network without going through a rigmarole so they checked your machine remotely, which
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.400]   is one way of doing it.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:17.200]   But generally speaking, if you don't have some methodology that lets alien equipment on
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:21.640]   the network, I think it's just an incompetence at the highest levels.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.680]   Yeah, you need that in large companies because if you get into the network, you can start
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   doing things like what Lord Flathead did.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:34.560]   Worse, worse, you come in and you've been home over the weekend, you got infected with Zotob,
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.720]   you come in, you're inside the corporate network now and you infect every other, that's what
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.880]   happened in CNN.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.240]   I think a big company is probably right to lock it down.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.720]   No, I think that's fine, but there are methodologies out there available for these big companies
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:51.240]   to keep you quarantined, to do all kinds of different things.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.240]   So you're still on the network, but you're not going to infect anybody.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:59.360]   There's virtualization in VPN combined and a lot of companies are doing that now.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.880]   There's even a company out there that I can't remember the name of that provides a virtualization
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:07.600]   service so that all the corporate apps and everything are in a virtual container on the
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:13.600]   person's own laptop or computer and they're managed by the IT network and everything that
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.320]   goes into the corporate network goes through that virtualized machine.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   And so it keeps it sanitary and then the person can do whatever they want with the rest of
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.320]   the machine.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   Get ready for this though, kids.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.320]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.960]   Let them have their own laptops.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:32.280]   According to a study sponsored by Dell from the Panama Institute, 12,000 laptops a week
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   are lost at US airports.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   12,000.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.720]   How do you lose a laptop at the airport?
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.960]   You leave it at security.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.720]   It gets stolen at security.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.320]   When you take it out, you watch it go through it comes out the other side.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.720]   I mean, come on.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.680]   I guess people get discombobulated and leave them by accident.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:56:00.720]   The worst the worst airport Los Angeles international than Miami, Kennedy and O'Hare.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:04.640]   But you got to figure that many of these laptops have proprietary business information
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   on them.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.640]   Huge problem.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.480]   And this is not kind of laptop thievery.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.080]   And laptops are up for grabs.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:17.320]   They say in this article that the real problem is people are stressed to catch a flight.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   They've got to go through security.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.320]   They've got a bunch of crap.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.360]   They have to take it all out.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.840]   And a lot of times it doesn't get back in.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.200]   And those airports you named are notoriously busy airports.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.200]   The busy airport.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.360]   The more like this is according to the study, the types of company information contained
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:40.720]   on these laptops includes customer or consumer data, 47% business confidential information,
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:47.160]   46% intellectual property, software drawings, renderings, 14% employee records, 13%.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.640]   Wait, intellectual property is only 14%.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.200]   Yeah, that gives you an idea.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.200]   That'd be 100%.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.360]   Like anybody with an empty car has some intellectual property.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.760]   It's the sales staff losing them.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:56.760]   They got nothing.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:57.760]   And there's nothing on there.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.760]   There's nothing.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:03.320]   I want intellectual property and copyright law to be defined how they defined it in this
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   survey.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.240]   There's no company intellectual prop.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.840]   Yeah, then where's the point percent?
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.320]   Well, I think that's 100% isn't it?
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.320]   Highly.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.320]   That's why they didn't name it.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.320]   That's 100%.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.320]   That's a given.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.320]   That's not intellectual property.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:23.320]   Well, this is one reason why those new notebook cases that just came out that let you put them
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.280]   through without taking the notebooks out.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.360]   That's one reason why those are expected to be so popular as well.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.360]   Yeah, Dwight.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.200]   How does the guy at the TSA know you've got one of those?
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.440]   Do they have a big sign on them?
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.440]   Do we have anyone?
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.440]   They're like butterflies.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.560]   You know, if you have an insert and you take it out, they'll let it go through.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.560]   I found this out.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.760]   This has always been the case.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.400]   As long as they can see it in the X-ray, they're a cool with it.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.760]   You don't have to see that it's a laptop.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.720]   Yeah, but I'm just saying if it's- I wonder those sleeves.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.720]   Yeah, sleeve works.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.280]   Well, sleeve is the same.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.120]   You could lose that just as easy as you could forget to put the laptop bag.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:58.080]   So they have these other bags that butterfly out, so they open up and then the point is
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.720]   that all the other crap in the bag is obscuring the laptop.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.240]   Yeah, they've adjusted the guidelines so they know there are certain bags where you
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.800]   don't actually have to take the laptop out and they can recognize those.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.240]   And those come with tags now that say this is one of those bags.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.480]   You don't have to take the laptop out.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:17.120]   And if you've got a competent TSA professional and you've got the right bag, you don't have
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.120]   to pull it out.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.120]   You just put it around the-
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.120]   Yeah, that's an oxymoron.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   That's a lot of fun.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.120]   I didn't say it was easy.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.760]   That's an oxymoron if I ever heard of one.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.600]   All right, we're going to take a break before we insult the TSA anymore and are no longer
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.120]   allowed to fly anywhere in the US.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.800]   I don't want to make it on that list.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.440]   I love those people.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.640]   I love the T- Blogger Bob.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:35.640]   We love you, dude.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.360]   Don't ever change.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.040]   Never did it here from Blogger Bob.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.360]   We have a standing invitation, Blogger Bob, with the TSA.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.360]   If you want to be on the show, you're more than welcome.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:49.480]   But first it's time to mention our sponsor audible.com, those audible books.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.480]   They're so great.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.920]   If you've not listened to an audiobook, you got to try them.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:57.320]   In fact, you get a free one right now by just going to audible.com/twit.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.480]   It's a great adjunct to your podcast listening.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.920]   You learn some history.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.240]   You do like my wife does.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.880]   She's reading Tori Spellings' new book, "The Story of My Life."
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.280]   It could be trashy.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.840]   It could be sexy.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.840]   It could be entertaining.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.840]   It's spooky.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.720]   The 50,000 plus titles.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.360]   By the way, I want to point this out.
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:21.080]   If you go to audible.com right now and at the bottom, election 2008, they have a whole
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.080]   section of books.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.200]   It's just like a bookstore now, where you can go to the section of election stuff.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:29.920]   They put online a lot of the speeches from the Democratic National Convention.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:33.320]   They'll do the same from the Republican National Convention.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.320]   Those are free.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.320]   Those are just pro bono.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:38.320]   You can download and listen to Obama's acceptance speech.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.840]   You can listen to his speech from 2004.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:40.840]   They have that online as well.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:45.640]   If you want to hear the speech that put him on the national agenda, you can also read
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:49.440]   books like "The Case Against Barack Obama."
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.400]   They've got it all.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:56.680]   It's really fun to go to the election 2008 section on audible.com.
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.200]   The new Bob Woodward, by the way, the war within will be coming out in one week.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.400]   That's going to be a hot one.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.480]   Also Thomas Friedman's new one, "Hot Flat and Crowded."
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.480]   The world is flat.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.760]   It's a incredible book read by Thomas Friedman.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.720]   His new one, I'm sure, is just as interesting.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720]   T. Boone's Pickens.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.000]   T. Boone's Pickens.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.800]   The first billion is the hardest.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.600]   If you like business books.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.600]   So true.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.800]   I know how that feels.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.120]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.720]   If you want to get a free book, we love Audible.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.360]   They've been a great sponsor for us over almost more than a year now.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.920]   We're looking forward to going into 2009 with Audible as well.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.920]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.120]   We thank them for their support and encourage you to give them a try.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.480]   If you haven't tried them, you're missing out on some great books.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.600]   So back we go to the tech news.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.040]   Internet traffic is beginning to bypass the US.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.840]   Our friend John Markoff wrote this story.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.880]   I asked John to be on, by the way, but he's on vacation.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.480]   He'll be back later in September.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.600]   We'll get him on the show.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.520]   He says that, of course, in the early days of the internet, most traffic went through
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.920]   the US because, in fact, the internet started here.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:14.040]   And even if you were sending data from Estonia to Latvia, it would often go through the US.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:19.840]   However, the balance of power shifting data is increasingly flowing around the US, not
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:26.360]   merely because it's faster, but because, in fact, people are afraid of having their data
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.280]   go through the US there.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:33.880]   And since the passage of the Patriot Act, many companies based outside of the US, according
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:38.040]   to Mark Rotenberg, who's the executive director of Epic, the Electronic Privacy Information
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.400]   Center, many companies are reluctant to store client information in the US.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:47.640]   They're afraid US intelligence agencies will be gathering this information without legal
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.280]   process.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:54.720]   Also it turns out to be a little bit cheaper not to do it.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.520]   It probably has more to do with it.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.680]   As we know, for a fact that the Chinese and the Russians in these other places aren't
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.600]   going to be gathering information without the process.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.520]   Who do you?
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:10.840]   They have established an undersea cable linking Georgia to Bulgaria so that they don't have
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.840]   --
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.360]   Yes, because Georgia was having a lot of problems when they got attacked by Russian hackers
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.520]   during that Russian invasion of South Ossetia and the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.800]   Somebody invaded somebody there.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.160]   It depends on what side you're on who was doing the invading and who was doing the
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160]   liberating.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.200]   But anyway, there was the hacking and they couldn't find another connection because most
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.880]   of their connections run through Russia.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.800]   So they're going to lay their own cable.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.160]   So it's not just shifting away from the US.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.560]   The Japanese, for instance, want to route through India and China so they don't have
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.760]   to route through the US.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.760]   The Georgians don't want to route through Russia so they go directly to Bulgaria.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.520]   I feel like some of this is just natural as the internet grows and grows and grows, people
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.960]   realize, well, we don't want everything having to go halfway across the world through North
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.000]   America and then back out.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.760]   What's the interesting part of this story to me was is the folks in Canada and closer
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.600]   areas like that who are making a conscious decision to route away from the United States,
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   even if it is faster or more convenient to do so because of, like you said, the Patriot
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.200]   Act or worries about financial records being under the scrutiny of the US government.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.080]   How real do you think that fear is?
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.160]   I'll tell you, it mirrors what I've been told by a lot of open source Linux types who have
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:32.680]   said, for instance, there's no major Linux conference in the US anymore because they
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.680]   don't want to come to the US.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:38.680]   They're afraid of getting arrested or prosecuted under the DMCA or just random.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.680]   They're afraid of it.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.680]   So they're having them in Canada.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.600]   They have them in other parts of the world.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.800]   They don't want to come to the US.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.600]   So they're afraid of getting picked up by the Gestapo.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.160]   Well, you know, remember Scliarov, who was the Russian computer scientist who was arrested
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:59.800]   because he published a paper on the, how fragile Adobe's ebook reader encryption was
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.960]   and how to crack it.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.800]   And it got arrested and spent some time in jail until they got them out.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.320]   And I think nobody wants to go through that again.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.480]   I think Scliarov was kind of the clarion called a computer scientist.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.480]   Stay out of the US.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480]   Their laws are crazy.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.560]   The crazy laws.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.600]   But if the internet is distributed and data can kind of flow where it needs to, how do
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.640]   you keep it from flowing through the US?
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.880]   Well, it's who you're here with, I think, right?
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880]   Yeah, if you have a direct line.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880]   I'm talking about mostly.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.120]   And you can with border gateway protocol and you know, you can say, I don't want it.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.320]   This is how I want to route it.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.080]   You can block, you can fence off where you don't want it to go.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.280]   Look, does this have any kind of any kind of implication for like the average user or
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.760]   is it something that's relatively esoteric?
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:48.400]   You know, Vince Surface quoted in the John's article as saying whether it's a good or
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.360]   bad thing depends on where you stand.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.440]   He says, suppose the internet was entirely confined to the US, which it once was.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440]   That wasn't helpful.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.360]   So he said, you know, I think his attitude is he works for Google now and Google is absolutely
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   global who Google doesn't care.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:08.280]   But it probably doesn't impact us.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.480]   And I don't think, Dwight, I don't think it means that no traffic from overseas is
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.640]   going to come in if they don't, you know, they want to stay out of our system.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.160]   I think if they're doing direct communications, obviously with people in the US, but I think
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:23.960]   what they're talking about, mostly is where the cloud exists, where the trunks exist, where
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.760]   the major, you know, peering exists, just to stay out of the US and minimize exposure.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:35.400]   Of course, the people at hits are these these big backbone owners like Verizon, AT&T, Quadrant,
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400]   Cojent, Comcast.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.960]   These are the guys who they'll be losing money.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:44.800]   Yeah, because so, you know, I guess it does impact us in the long run.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.440]   It could impact the economy.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.440]   It's bad for business.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.360]   I don't see this is not a big deal.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.240]   And I think it's just a nature of how the internet grows.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.280]   And, you know, there are always going to be people who may not want their traffic to
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.280]   go in certain places.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.920]   But I think it's good that you have multiple different places where your traffic can go
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:05.840]   and that traffic is going where naturally it should go rather than these trombone connections,
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.080]   which I thought was a great term.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:12.720]   And they try to get the traffic away from their competitors regionally and like, send it way
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.720]   far away.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.480]   Yeah, I totally agree with you, Jim.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.880]   I guess that's why the only parts of the story that bothered me is people who would be benefiting
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:24.040]   by routing the traffic through the United States because it's faster or more convenient,
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.000]   them starting to say, well, maybe I don't want to because of privacy concerns.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.040]   I think that's bad for the internet in the long term.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:35.160]   Whether, you know, whether the climate stays the way it is is up for question, I suppose.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.840]   Has anybody seen this picture of the iPhone girl?
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:40.840]   What is that?
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   You know, okay.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.480]   So, yeah, I know about by the scene or picture.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   I'm trying to find the Chinese woman, right?
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480]   Right.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.480]   Right.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480]   Showed up on an iPhone.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480]   She works at Foxconn where they build the iPhones.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.840]   Apparently they were they she was taking pictures of herself with an iPhone and somebody
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.920]   got it.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.840]   And they were tough.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:05.120]   No, because she's doing the peace sign and an English guy got the iPhone.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.320]   Yeah, he looks at it.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:12.520]   There's some Chinese girl making peace signs and they're competing with each other and
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.960]   they've fallen around.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:19.520]   And so unfortunately, I'm trying to find the the it's at Mac rumors, but I can't I can't
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520]   seem to.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.440]   Well, you know, if you go to if you go to Google and type in iPhone girl, you get all
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.160]   their pictures and then you get a lot of pictures.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.160]   I don't know if they're her.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.160]   No, she's there.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.120]   She's right there in the right there where it says iPhone.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   Oh, there she is.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.120]   She's the one in the clean suit.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.040]   So where's the oh my goodness.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.000]   I like the one up in the upper right hand corner.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   The best.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Wow.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   Oh, there she is.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   iPhone girl.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   Okay.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   With the peace sign.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   Oh, that's cute.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Peace sign.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   She's got a little bunny suit on.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   That's cute.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   It's like they're fooling around.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   What's wrong with that?
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.120]   Yeah, I think I would love I think they should do this all the time.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.160]   Who needs the inspected by number six thing in there?
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.400]   I want my iPhone to come with a picture of the person who built it.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   I like it.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400]   Why not?
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400]   Why not?
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.280]   That's like inspected by a number six.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.000]   This is more modern.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.120]   Expected by this person right here.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120]   I built it.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.120]   I made your iPhone.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.000]   I think that would join us together would bring the world together would kind of hell.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.920]   You know, remind us that somebody's making this stuff somewhere.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.840]   So then you go over to China on vacation.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.760]   You're walking down the street and all of a sudden the person who made your iPhone walks
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   by.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.760]   What do you do?
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   Six.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.760]   Hey, thanks for making my iPhone.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.760]   Number six.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.760]   What if you didn't like it?
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.760]   Thank you.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.760]   Unless you do my iPhone.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.280]   Unless of course there were only like five or six different models, you know, like silons
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.160]   and it could be an only something you can fake it.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.160]   Or it's Tom.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.160]   Lord, flathead.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.320]   It's worth flathead on your iPhone.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:55.560]   I just I think it's kind of I think the people reason people have kind of become fascinated
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.840]   by it is that it does put a real person behind it.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.600]   By the way, they've people followed up on this.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   They've gone to Foxconn.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.440]   They're trying to track her down.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.520]   She's being stalked by paparazz.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.080]   I mean, this is unhealthy.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:17.640]   According to iPhone Ali, the girl is a worker at the Shenzhen factory.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   She still has her job.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.960]   She hasn't gotten in trouble.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.480]   A representative from Foxconn says she's definitely not fired.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.840]   I think that's great.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.480]   I think this should I would I'm telling you, Apple, you're missing the boat.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.560]   What a picture of who made your phone on every phone.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.560]   A little bit.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.080]   Then you know what happens is they start faking it.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.600]   They're like, oh, yeah, this is the person that made your iPhone.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.320]   They hire actors and I want that in the upper right hand corner.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.000]   I want her to make my iPhone.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.440]   You know, I finally got an iPhone 3G today.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   Today.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.160]   What did you try to get one earlier?
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.880]   I tried but I didn't want to mess with waiting in line.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.440]   So it's a fine line though.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440]   You got up really early.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.960]   The day came out, I know because your wife told me.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.960]   The day I came out.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.960]   Yeah, I had to go in and cover it.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.880]   I had to go in and do streaming two hours live phone calls from crazy.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.200]   I found two hours.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.200]   You're a wuss.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.200]   I did twenty.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.040]   I'm hanging out with Tom's wife for what reason.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.240]   She works for her, Jim.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.240]   Sorry.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.160]   Get delivered.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.600]   Devorak.org/blog for the inside story.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.600]   Oh, good.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.920]   Now that guy can drink his wine out there.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.640]   He's been waiting all.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.840]   They sit there with a glass in hand waiting for Devorak to plug his blog.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.600]   Yeah, I'm not plugging in enough and these guys are sobering up on me.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.600]   That's bad.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.760]   We don't want a sober audience.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.400]   See, that's where Devorak goes wrong.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.280]   They get drunk and the audience stays sober.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.560]   We do it the other way around.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:44.160]   The only reason I bring it up is the very nice fellow who sold me the iPhones tried to
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.680]   take my old one.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.680]   What?
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.560]   He said, "Well, because it's a swap, you have to give me your old iPhone."
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.560]   No, sorry.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.160]   I said, "No, I'm not giving you my old iPhone.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.800]   I think you're mistaken."
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.920]   So he went and checked with the supervisor and came back and was like, "Oh, no, no, no."
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.680]   He also tried to tell me I wasn't going to get the subsidized price.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.760]   And I'm like, "Well, maybe you ought to just run that through the computer."
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.920]   And so, "Oh, the computer says you're going to get the subsidized price."
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.120]   Was this an Apple store or an AT&T store?
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   This is an Apple store.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   I was an idiot.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.120]   Where'd the get this guy?
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.200]   Oh, he's the genius.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200]   I'm sorry, I'm the genius.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.600]   I don't usually work here.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.160]   He must be new.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.960]   He must be new here.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:23.040]   He has a crate full of old iPhones that people have.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.040]   Well, really?
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:29.280]   Because it's Tom Merritt knows what's going on, but 99% of people say, "Oh, okay, here."
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.400]   They buy for the T-Mobile store.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.120]   So they do it T-Mobile?
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.080]   Yeah, he unlocks and it sells him to the T-Mobile store.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.560]   So digging around for the iPhone girl, I ran into this guy's photo stream.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.360]   And I think this may not be a bad thing to kind of start as a trend.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.360]   What's this?
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:51.800]   This guy, Greg Wilker, he's on an airplane and he takes pictures of people conked out
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.240]   with their mouth open and then posts them on the flicker.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.080]   And he's got this poor girl, her mouth's open.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.240]   She's just short of drooling and then she's her heads down.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.240]   It's hilarious.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.240]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.240]   It's terrible.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.760]   They're not called trends anymore, John.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.320]   They're called memes, remember?
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.320]   Memes.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.960]   I never run anybody to call them "memes."
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.160]   Yeah, my wife.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.080]   Memes, that's your wife.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.080]   It's a meme.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.080]   So what is it?
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.080]   Is he on Flickr?
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080]   Greg Wilker?
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.080]   How do you spell it?
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.080]   W-I-A-W-I-G-R-E-G-W-I-L-K-E-R.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.080]   All right, cool.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.080]   Let me get it again.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.080]   I'm up there.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.080]   I see it's a crazy dog.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   What type can be the dog?
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.080]   Sleep on a plane?
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.080]   G-R-E-G-W-I-L-K-E-R.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:45.080]   Type in, let's see, here, type in is the sleep mode plane girl.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.080]   PLA and E.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.080]   Sleep mode plane girl.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.080]   Wow.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:13:01.080]   So he must have a, he must have like a set, a photo set of people falling asleep.
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:05.360]   Well, he's, I think that's a great idea to, I think everybody should have one thing that
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.440]   they take pictures of.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.080]   Yeah, I think so too.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.080]   Oh my God, she's out.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.080]   Oh my God, I think I know her.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   Oh my God.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.080]   I see the texture.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.560]   Yeah, she's one of our, she's one of our listeners.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.560]   Oh my God, she's, listen, I can see.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.560]   She's got the earbuds in.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.560]   She's the fact that she's out in the sleep.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.560]   She's listening to Twit right now.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.560]   I can see it.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.560]   Holy cow.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.560]   This is the only one he has.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.560]   He doesn't take my life.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:31.560]   No, okay, but he is, he's, okay.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.560]   Well, let's make it a trend.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.560]   Let's make it a me me.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.560]   So I noticed this pretty looking girl before we bored.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.560]   She has an iPhone.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.560]   One of the things, oh, this guy's like a creepy stockazoid.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.560]   One of the things I noticed about her right away, also because I have fun.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.560]   So I take her.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:46.560]   I take a picture.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.560]   I named her sleep mode.
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.560]   This girl was out before we pulled on the runway.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.720]   Oh man, she needs to get one of those straps you put under your chin to keep your mouth
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.720]   closed.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.720]   Poor kid.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.720]   Poor kid.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:57.720]   She's now world famous.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:04.560]   Well, hopefully she'll, although I doubt she listens to this show, you know, you know,
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560]   whatever.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   Is this illegal or I mean, that's a public place, I guess, huh?
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.560]   Well, I don't know.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.560]   There's two.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.560]   There's another picture of her.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:13.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.560]   Yeah, that's two.
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.560]   That's, that's Laura Feasts.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.320]   That's the girl in the iPod commercial, isn't it?
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.320]   The stone one?
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.720]   Oh, you think so?
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720]   Look at her.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.800]   That's the girl.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.560]   That's a girl in the stone iPod commercial.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.040]   I'd know her anywhere.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.400]   She's feastsish.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.400]   She's definitely feasted.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.400]   Is that what's in her name?
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.400]   Laura Feasts, your own.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.400]   Oh, it's a fight.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400]   That's a fight.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.400]   Ellen Feasts.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   That's who it is.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:44.000]   The next picture in his stream is of a woman with tattoos on her arm or maybe sharpie writing
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.640]   and who's holding a snake.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.640]   I think he's got a different meme.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   That's a new meme.
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.640]   You know, that could be Ellen Feish.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.640]   You might be right.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.040]   Wouldn't that be, it does look like her, doesn't it?
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.040]   But the snake.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.040]   It looks exactly like her.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.640]   Now the way to go is she's got that mole under a right eye.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.440]   If she, if Ellen Feish has that, that would be it.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.440]   How do you remember that?
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440]   Ellen Feish is also right.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440]   No, I'm just saying, no, this girl's got the mole.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.040]   I don't know what Ellen does.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.040]   Oh, I see.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.040]   I see.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.680]   We are sad lonely people.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.200]   If Molly would have only said yes to being on this show, we would be nowhere near this problem
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   right now.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.200]   [laughter]
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.200]   Holy cow.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   That's suck.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.200]   We suck.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.200]   I'm sorry, everybody.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.560]   Yeah, then that poor guy, Greg, is not a stalker.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.120]   He just happened to be sitting next to her.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:27.120]   Well, I know that in the time that you started talking about it, to now the number of views
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.120]   has gone from 1,400 to 9,000.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.560]   Greg's going to go, what the hell's going on?
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.120]   There's all these people looking at my...
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.120]   There's got a lot of hotities on this thing.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.120]   Oh.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.160]   There's a lot of jack the number way up.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.120]   There's a lot of hotities on here.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.120]   Wow.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.560]   Aren't you, John, aren't you the guy who usually keeps us on topic?
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.560]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560]   You're right.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.840]   I'm going to miss.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   All right.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.840]   I'm just going to...
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.840]   I'm so glad I was...
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.840]   Back to the news.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.840]   There's no more news.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.840]   That's any other stories.
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.240]   Tom, you do news all week long.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.280]   You must know some other hot stories.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.720]   It all leaves my mind.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.320]   The Comcast thing was the biggest story ever.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.640]   I'm sure we all spent a lot of time talking about that.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.800]   I actually got calls for interviews on radio stations to talk about it.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.080]   Now I'm feeling guilty because John says I'm just being paranoid.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   Well, you know, there's also...
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.560]   There's the Windows XP...
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.000]   Nag screen that is being introduced with the new...
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   Oh, really?
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.440]   Windows genuine advantage app.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.760]   Why are you using Vista?
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.800]   Why are you using Vista screen?
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.880]   What they do is they have taken the same approach to telling you that you may have a
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:39.560]   pirated version that's in SP1 of Vista and they're adding it to Windows XP Pro only,
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.080]   not home or media edition.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:48.200]   So if you have a version that's pirated or if the Windows genuine advantage burps and
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:53.880]   malfunctions, it'll give you a black background and a little watermark that says you may be
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.160]   the victim of pirated software.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.760]   And of course, most of the time you're not.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.880]   It's just a failure in the Windows genuine advantage.
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.320]   They estimated themselves.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.680]   It fails like 5% of the time.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:06.760]   Yes.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:13.000]   So this is coming to anybody who has Windows XP Pro who regularly updates their computer.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.480]   How long before they put a thing up saying you'd be much happier with Vista?
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.960]   Jerry Seinfeld says, "What's the deal with XP?
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.680]   Why are you still using it?"
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.920]   Hey, you should read my column this week.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:33.360]   It's probably posted now, I'm sure, at fenmarketwatch.com where I take on the Microsoft hiring of Jerry
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.360]   Seinfeld.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.800]   It does seem like it kind of.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.560]   We talked a little bit about it this week.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.920]   My premise I started off the best is let's face it.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.680]   The one thing we had to assume from the beginning before we do the analysis is that these ads
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.680]   are going to stink.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.520]   They ain't going to be...
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.520]   That's prejudicial.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.640]   No, they ain't going to be John Hodgman and Justin Long.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.640]   I could tell you that right now.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.120]   That's John Hodgman, that's for sure.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.240]   What about the guy who got his password changed by Lloyd's?
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.920]   What's that?
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:06.560]   This was a BBC story, a guy named Steve Gettley from Shrewsbury called in and gave his password
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:12.800]   and they said it was wrong, found out that he had made his password Lloyd's pants because
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.560]   he was upset about an insurance problem.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:24.200]   But someone in Lloyd's IT had changed it to know it's not.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.240]   Does Lloyd's pants mean something in Britain?
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.240]   I mean, is it...
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:30.600]   His pants refers to underpants in England.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.040]   Saying something is pants is a mild insult.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.040]   Panties.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.040]   Like panties.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.040]   And panties.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.040]   No, it's not.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.040]   He tried.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.640]   He's like, "Fine, I'll change my password to Barclays is better."
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.360]   They said, "No, that's too many characters."
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.720]   So then he's like, "Well, how about censorship?"
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.960]   And they said, "No, it has to be no more than six letters long."
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.600]   Eventually, he gave up and just changed something else.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:59.080]   Lloyd's TSB has fired the IT person who changed the password and they've apologized to the
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.240]   guy and said, "Hey, we're sorry."
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.240]   He thought we were pants.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:06.240]   But, you know, at the same time, they shouldn't have changed his password.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.240]   We are pants.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.080]   But you shouldn't be able to see the password.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   Right.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.080]   Okay.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080]   Now, that's the key to the story, right?
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.320]   Because he has a business account.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.680]   And apparently, normally, you can't see the passwords in ClearText at all.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.440]   But the BBC story just kind of leaves it out there as like, "Well, because this was a
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.680]   shared business account, therefore, the password was available for staff to see."
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.680]   Now, why is that?
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:26.680]   I have no idea.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.320]   And what does that mean?
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.960]   A shared business account.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:34.440]   Well, I guess she's on a business account, maybe a small business and multiple people
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.440]   have access to it.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.440]   I don't know.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.960]   Are you guys excited about Android?
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:43.400]   I've seen pictures now in a gadget of an Android phone aimed at T-Mobile sometime soon.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.720]   Can I say that?
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:49.300]   Folio looks just like the HTC phone that I've been using on T-Mobile that I hate more than
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.300]   life itself.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:51.300]   It doesn't really.
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.300]   It's the so-called HTC dream.
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:53.300]   It's an HTC.
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.920]   It looks just like this one that the wing, I think.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.240]   It's like a cross between the wing and the helio ocean.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.240]   And I've used both of those.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.840]   And I just don't like either of them.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.280]   And I think it's just a retread design.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.280]   It does remind me a little-
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.440]   Life itself is what you said you hate life itself.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.640]   I knew you'd pick up on that, John.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   Somebody was listening now.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.400]   I actually- I hate it more than the trio that I gave up for it.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.960]   It looks a little bit like a sidekick.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.620]   Is that thing just slide up or does it swing up out of the way we don't know?
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:22.620]   It looks like a slide.
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:26.860]   I mean, HTC is very good at these sort of slider phones.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.620]   And it looks like a slider.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.460]   I can't get excited by it.
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:33.420]   I like some of the apps that won the Android challenge.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:34.620]   That's some pretty cool stuff in there.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:39.820]   Like the one that scans the barcode and then searches Google for prices.
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:40.900]   That's what I want.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.900]   I totally want that.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.580]   I want to know that on the iPhone.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.980]   So you go in a store- and of course Target hates this idea.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:49.280]   Any store hates this idea because you go in a store and you say, "I like that.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:51.720]   Let's scan it and see if their price is competitive."
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.720]   And if not, you just order it online.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.120]   That is a great app.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.360]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.520]   No reason not to do it.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.920]   That app won a guy $250,000 for making it.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.920]   Really?
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:03.920]   Yeah, that's that Android challenge.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:09.440]   The Android guys- How long before they banned people with Android phones in the nearest Walmart
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.280]   to say, "You can't come in here!"
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.440]   They start just like it used to be for concerts.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.440]   They pack you down.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.260]   Are you having to check your phones?
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.260]   Are you scanning?
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:18.660]   Are you- Now they don't do that anymore.
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:19.660]   They encourage you.
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:21.580]   In fact, I was at a John Mellon camp concert.
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:25.020]   He says before he sings his, you know, "Jack and Diane" his big hit.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:29.940]   He says, "Pull out your cell phones everybody and call your best friend."
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:31.780]   And he says, "I'll wait."
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:33.940]   And then he waits like 30 seconds.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:34.940]   He says, "All right, hold your phone up.
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:37.660]   We're going to sing the song and I got something to say to your friends.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.580]   Hey, guys!
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:43.420]   Your friend really likes you because he's going to- You can now hear me sing my song.
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.420]   And he plays a song.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:45.920]   He has everybody holding their phone up."
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:51.900]   "That's crazy how it used to be this big security and now they're like, 'That's good marketing!'
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:57.920]   Or did- Said there's cell certs now where people go online and stream a concert from
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.080]   somebody's cell phone?
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.080]   I think that's great.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.840]   I wonder what- Well, because they don't make any money to music anymore.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.320]   They only make money at concerts so they want to drive up.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.320]   Yeah, but you have to start to pay performance fees.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.160]   What does ASCAP think about that if you've made a stunt?
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.320]   They hate it.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:16.100]   If you own the song yourself, it's- No, but what if you've seen somebody else's material?
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:21.580]   Well, is that true even if you're John Cougar, Melon Camp, can you say, "Okay, this is my
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:22.580]   concert.
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.460]   It's my song and you can steal it.
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:25.460]   You can't do that."
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:26.980]   None of it's somebody else's music.
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.300]   "Nobody fits yours and you wrote it and you have the publishing rights.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.420]   Are you allowed to say I waive publishing rights?"
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.020]   Oh, I have to be.
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:34.020]   I don't know.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.020]   That's a mechanic.
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.020]   There are other people who are attached to those.
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:38.740]   Yeah, but I think the record company has some say in this.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:39.740]   I bet you can.
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:43.280]   Yeah, why don't we think of the record companies more often?
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.280]   Come on.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.760]   Yeah, those poor guys, they're in a dying business.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.440]   Let them have their last few days.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.920]   Maybe they're asleep on a plane somewhere.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:56.240]   I'm going to stop beating up on the record industry and start taking a more sympathetic
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.080]   view because I think you're right.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.080]   It's sad.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:02.840]   They're going the way of cylinders and music.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.240]   It's like beating up on piano roll sales, man.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.240]   What are you going to do?
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.640]   These guys are in limos right now with hookers drinking champagne headed to the private jet
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.700]   and you're going to take that perspective.
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.580]   For now, they're in those jets, but those jets are going to be gone.
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.180]   I don't think those fuckers won't be there for tomorrow.
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:19.680]   Ain't nobody driving.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.920]   Yeah, even didn't Pete, did he give up his private jet?
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.240]   He said he have to fly commercial now.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.960]   That'll be the day.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   No, he did.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:27.960]   I've sought on friend feed.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.600]   He said that guy's got so much money.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.600]   He's making more money.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.200]   They've got all these business deals than he's ever made as a singer.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.640]   gasoline is so expensive.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.640]   No.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.640]   All right.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640]   You don't believe me?
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   It's true.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.280]   I'm pulling up the page right now.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.280]   I hate these.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:50.080]   You know what I hate is when they use these URL shortening services that are like somebody's
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.320]   running it out of their garage.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.320]   You snurl.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320]   That's pretty good.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.320]   I love snurl.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.760]   I use a snipper.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:01.560]   This guy's using pop or pop or LOPRL and it's not coming up.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.560]   Shoot.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.880]   I see this story.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.600]   Come on, pop or L. I believe in you.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:14.360]   Pete did he switched from his private jet to commercial flights over fuel prices and
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.200]   an associated press story.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.740]   There you go.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:23.160]   He complained about the quote, too high price of gas and pleaded for free oil from his Saudi
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.440]   Arabian brothers and sisters.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.040]   Hey, it's worth a shot.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.760]   He's worth a shot.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.760]   He says, we're sick and say is no.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.960]   He says, Leo, why don't you try that?
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.360]   I'm bleeding from my Saudi Arabian brothers and sisters.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.320]   Much just jet costs.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:45.080]   Well, he says it cost him $200,000 previously.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.080]   It cost him $200,000 and up for a round trip between New York and Los Angeles.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:52.400]   He says, I'm actually flying commercial.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.920]   That's how high gas prices are.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.200]   I'm at the gate right now.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.600]   This is really happening.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.280]   Proof gas prices are too high.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:03.360]   So whoever the next president is, we need to bring gas prices down for the private jets.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.040]   $200,000 doesn't sound right.
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.560]   I remember when gas was only $200,000 for a jet plane.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.560]   For round trip?
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.560]   Sound right.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.560]   That number just doesn't wash.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.560]   For round trip?
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560]   It'd be about $5,000 to $10,000 an hour.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.800]   Well, that's 10 hours.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:17.800]   There you go.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:18.800]   $100,000.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   All right, let's let's all the hookers in the cocaine.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.800]   This is the P.D.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800]   I'm here today.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.120]   This is called Diddy Blonde number.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.480]   Diddy Blonde number 12, Diddy Blonde number 12.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.160]   Gas prices are too high.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.960]   As you know, I do own my own jet.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.840]   But I have to have the fly back and forth to LA for suing my acting career.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:48.560]   Now, if I'm flying back and forth like twice in a month, that's like $200,000, $250,000
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.560]   round trip.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:54.960]   I'm back on American Airlines right now.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:55.960]   Okay.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.400]   That is that your boy Diddy.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.400]   You can't even keep a straight face.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.400]   American Airlines.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.880]   I can I can assure you one thing.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.880]   What's that?
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:08.880]   That's an absolute fact.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.160]   He hasn't flown American for some time.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.960]   Why is that?
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:18.120]   Because he was charged to now because they charge $200,000 per bag.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:25.120]   Gas prices are too high.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.760]   I want to give a shout out to all my Saudi Arabian brothers and sisters and all my brothers
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.400]   and sisters from all the countries that have oil.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:36.200]   If you ever please send me some oil for my jet, I would truly appreciate it.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.240]   That is impressive.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.080]   His grasp of geopolitics is really impressive.
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.680]   Yeah, I think we can't considering him for Secretary of Energy.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.720]   But right now I am actually, can you believe this?
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.080]   I'm actually flying commercial.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.920]   That's how high gas prices are.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:53.920]   Okay.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:54.920]   So I feel.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.360]   I said I have a hard time feeling for him.
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.960]   Maybe he should take up a collection.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:02.960]   This is really happening.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.920]   This is even that gas price is too high.
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:06.920]   Okay.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:07.920]   We need to do something about this.
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:08.920]   He's so in touch.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.760]   Get him a PayPal account.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:18.560]   The deep pain that the little people are feeling now in the real world.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.560]   Okay.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:24.080]   Well, I hope our brothers and sisters in Saudi Arabia are listening right now and do what
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.080]   you can.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.080]   I love for Diddy, man.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:27.080]   Have some love for Diddy.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.880]   What about the ones in Venezuela?
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.880]   Or Alaska.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.680]   He said other countries around the world.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.680]   He'll tell you how they're going to participate.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.320]   Or I'll send them all off in Alberta, Canada.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320]   Don't kid yourself.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.320]   All right, guys.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320]   Well, I think that's a good way to end this show.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.320]   A little guest appearance by P Diddy.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:48.160]   And I'm going to put Tony to work bleeping out all the profanity.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.960]   But you know, you feel his anger, don't you?
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.200]   It really is there.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.200]   It's real.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.200]   Such rage.
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.200]   Such rage.
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.200]   Where's the outrage?
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.040]   That's where the outrage is.

[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.360]   Just a wonderful, wonderful bunch of stuff.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   Great show Scam School.

[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.160]   Man, I haven't paid for drinks since I started watching.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.960]   Tom's wife is the producer.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:18.360]   So, you're kidding?
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.440]   No wonder that's such a good show.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.440]   It is a good show.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.440]   It's a great show.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.440]   Awesome show.

[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.840]   We got to get you back on, Leo.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:43.840]   Oh, anytime.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.840]   Anytime.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:47.800]   Now that, you know, 10 o'clock was bad for me because I did the Ros thing, but she's
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.040]   almost, she lands in Hawaii tomorrow.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.840]   She was been rowing across the ocean.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:55.240]   So I won't have any 10 o'clock calls anymore so we can do it.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240]   Anytime.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240]   The work time.

[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   Absolutely.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.400]   They're about to get washed away.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.960]   Good luck in the, I guess Houston's going to be all right.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:18.000]   But yeah, we may get a little water at once it moves ashore, but I think we're going to
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000]   be fine.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   All right.

[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.160]   Yeah, I gave up on Twitter.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.160]   We have our own Twitter.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.800]   We should join our Twitter army.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.800]   Yeah, I know.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.480]   I had a bunch of people are twittering me, pestering me about that.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.480]   I decided.
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:43.480]   Why don't you give up Twitter?
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.280]   I'm on Twitter, by the way, at JLouderby.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.400]   But why don't you give up on Twitter?
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.400]   I actually haven't.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:51.120]   I still use Twitter effect at broadcast, but it's, well, it's, it's too big a thing.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:55.960]   And what I, what I did is what I, I did an interview with Evan Prodromo who created
