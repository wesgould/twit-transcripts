[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.860]   Hey, good friend, no one stone.
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.620]   Oh, doctor from odocte.com.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.020]   Hey, Owen.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.040]   He's wearing a Reggie--
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.860]   Who's who's who's who's--

[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.300]   Old 92.
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.800]   Yes.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.540]   Good man.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.580]   Good team.
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.620]   Good to have you here, Owen.
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.620]   I appreciate you.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.460]   From New Jersey.
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.180]   I love him.
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.700]   Right.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.580]   He let me stay.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.860]   I'm paying rent.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.100]   Also here, Karis Swisher from All Things D, All Things
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.620]   Digital.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.900]   Hi.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.980]   Good to see you, Karis.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.300]   Welcome back.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.140]   Thank you.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.900]   Mr. John C. Devorek.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.900]   Channel Devorek.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.900]   Hello.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.020]   He's wearing his hunting flannels.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.460]   We're going hunting.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.300]   I thought you just worried somebody might shoot you.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.940]   I think you're in elk.
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.020]   Big chain of style.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.500]   Well, that could be too.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.620]   So you can't be too careful nowadays.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.700]   Someday elks are going to start wearing red plaid,
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.140]   and then they'll be in trouble.
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.300]   And also, I'm glad-- very glad to welcome the man in the dark.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.940]   If you're watching on video, Mr. Ryan Block.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.300]   I'm GDGT.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.900]   You didn't go to CTIA.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.420]   No, you're not.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.060]   I've been trying to curtail my traveling.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.460]   It's been nice.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.940]   CTIA, was it in Vegas?
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.780]   It's in Vegas.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.620]   Yeah, this spring.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.300]   I'm not sure where it's going to be in fall.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.460]   Well, there's several big cell phone conferences,
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.940]   but this is one of them.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.700]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.540]   It's not the biggest.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.140]   The whole world congress, I think,
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.260]   was the one to be at this year.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.660]   Yeah, that was the one in Spain.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.500]   Yeah, in Barcelona.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.420]   That's where they introduced Windows Phone 7.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.740]   Well, apparently a lot of Android handsets.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.100]   You were-- Kara, you must have been at CTIA.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.140]   I was not this year.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.260]   I was last year, but I was not this year.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.580]   But it was Android heavy from when I understand.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.820]   Yeah, that's exciting.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.580]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.380]   Indeed.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.900]   For those of us who like me, Carrie and Nexus,
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.340]   what-- oh, this would be a good poll.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.140]   Oh, and what do you carry?
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.540]   iPhone, two of them.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.260]   Two iPhones.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.740]   Unfortunately.
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.340]   Kara, are you an iPhone user?
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.580]   I tried the Nexus 1.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.980]   It was a little too geeky for me.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.060]   So I gave it to John Pachkowski, and it's too geeky for him.
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.500]   Really?
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.100]   So we can't get away-- the iPhone is what we use.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.700]   We use the iPhone.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.220]   OK.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.140]   Get all things to you.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.660]   John, are you still using the E71 to know, yeah?
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.660]   I use either the E71 or depending.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.220]   If I'm going to be doing anything more complicated,
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.740]   I use an Nexus 1 just for the turn-by-turn instructions,
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.460]   if nothing else.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.460]   You heard it here first.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.460]   John uses depends.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.220]   And Ryan, you could use any phone in the world.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.060]   I guess we all could.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.460]   What are you using?
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.420]   I use a few phones.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.460]   But the 3GS is my main.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.820]   I have a Nexus 1 on my desk, though.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.020]   I like playing around with it.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.780]   I love mine.
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.900]   I guess I'm the only one here.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.820]   I love it.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.940]   And I retired the iPhone for the Nexus 1.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.380]   I just love it.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.820]   You know what?
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.700]   If you want to make calls, great phone.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.620]   If you want to use 130,000 apps,
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.340]   then probably not your cup of tea.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.140]   Well, there's apps on here that I really love.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.260]   There's a new Google Apps called My Tracks.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.300]   That's really great because it has background processing.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.100]   Goggles is great.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.140]   Goggles is great.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.660]   The--
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.620]   It's kind of freaky, though.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.500]   I have to say, I was with one of the 12-year-olds who
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.300]   was working on the Nexus 1.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.220]   And I asked them in the goggles where
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.100]   you can-- it's visual search, essentially.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.620]   And I said, well, can you do people?
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.340]   And they said, we don't.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.020]   And I said, well, that's not the answer.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.540]   Can you?
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.060]   And they said, we don't.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.540]   So--
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.540]   They can, obviously.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.620]   They can, obviously.
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.540]   So that was a little freaky.
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.180]   In fact, there are others who are doing it.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.940]   And I don't know.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.900]   I feel like Google should turn that on.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.220]   I think that the government can do it.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.180]   Yeah, they're not scary enough as it is.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.340]   I think they may be not.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.300]   Just give them all the power.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.940]   It's not Google that would be scary with face search.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.420]   It's the stalkers who would be using it
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.100]   to take pictures of people on the street.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.540]   Well, we'd have four square in Gawala.
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.860]   Everybody's in the stalking now.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.260]   It's the big thing.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.740]   Exactly.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.180]   But that's opt-in.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.860]   Goggles would be--
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.780]   Opt-ins.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.260]   Not opt-in.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.620]   Whatever.
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.100]   Yeah, no.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.620]   It would be the favorite tool of stalkers everywhere.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.340]   So why not?
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.860]   Let's be honest.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.300]   So Goggles does not really work all that fantastically well.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.780]   No.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.100]   Not yet.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.300]   Not yet.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   It has potential.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.380]   But it does not blow my mind the first time I used it.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.820]   At least not the actual voice search on the Nexus 1.
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.260]   I thought it was great, especially because it
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.340]   has that mic on the back of the phone.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.780]   They can pick up background noise
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.180]   and cancels it out.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.900]   Makes the voice search a lot more accurate.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.700]   Not just voice search.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.980]   Everywhere a keyboard comes up, you
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.420]   have the option of voice dictation.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.900]   I use that a lot for texting and the chatting.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.140]   And if you are careful in your speech
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.860]   and pronounce each word carefully,
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.180]   you can get a pretty--
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.900]   it does a pretty good job.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.420]   It does.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.900]   It does.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.100]   I kind of like that.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.620]   I found the screen is better.
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.260]   I found the applications that for the most part
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.220]   that I want are on there.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.260]   So I'm pretty happy.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.380]   I do not feel like I'm missing out on anything.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.900]   I just want to Google Voice on my iPhone.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.700]   That's the one thing that--
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.780]   That's the app that's awesome on this.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.860]   Basically, use Google Voice on the Nexus 1.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.340]   It becomes your voice mail.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.620]   Exactly.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.060]   That's the one thing that kills me about the whole battle
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.820]   that goes on with these companies.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.620]   They're starting to cut each other off of the hip for no reason.
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.900]   Well, now that's an interesting thing,
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.540]   because last week-- and we talked about it--
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.420]   The New York Times had a very big article about the Google
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.980]   versus Apple Wars.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.700]   Is it a coincidence that on Friday, Steve Jobs and Eric
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.980]   Schmidt are seen sitting outside having a cup of coffee?
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.780]   Coffee shop at Palo Alto.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.380]   They had no idea they'd be seen.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.900]   It's amazing.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.900]   No idea.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.300]   It's a coincidence.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.620]   There are no coincidences.
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.260]   And they sat outside.
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.060]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.780]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.740]   They need disguises.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.260]   They need to create disguises.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.300]   Eric Schmidt could wear a wig and a mustache or something
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.940]   like that.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.300]   So do you think, Cara, that this was a setup?
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.060]   Oh, totally.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.980]   Come on, please.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.260]   They know-- I mean, Steve Jobs is one of the best known people,
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.180]   at least in Silicon Valley, perhaps not across the world.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.460]   But across the world, even--
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.620]   Palo Alto, he is.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.180]   Everybody knows.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.700]   Well, certainly.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.300]   Absolutely.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.100]   And Eric Schmidt's relatively well known,
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.700]   but they knew they were going to be found.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.100]   They gathered a crowd gathering.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.580]   It's kind of like a celebrity thing.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.940]   When they celebrities bring out their kids into a playground,
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.380]   or whatever, like Tiger Woods wife wearing Nike now,
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.740]   I don't know.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.420]   Something like that.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.700]   So do the asemiotics.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.540]   What's the point?
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.340]   That they're not hating each other, maybe.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.860]   Why?
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.820]   I think these wanted to have a cup of coffee together.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.740]   Or tea, probably.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.100]   It's Steve's case.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.940]   Calm down.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.460]   The calm things down, I think, probably.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.380]   The thing is--
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.860]   So this--
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.020]   Go ahead.
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.660]   This wasn't downtown Palo Alto.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.260]   This is at a small coffee shop in a strip mall.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.220]   Strip mall, yeah.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.900]   Not too far from Cupertino.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.420]   And I know it.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.620]   I've been to that coffee shop before, and it's pretty good.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.860]   So I mean, look, these are two very busy guys.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.340]   I'm sure that they knew that it was a possibility.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.060]   But they don't exactly have time to sit around and hope
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.420]   that they get photographed and block off
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.460]   two hours of their day on the off chance
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.380]   that finally somebody's going to take a shot of them
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.100]   and send it to a blog.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.060]   I think they knew.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.540]   I think it's pretty--
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.180]   I think they knew.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.340]   I have to say, I feel like it's a setup too.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.180]   You think so?
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.180]   Absolutely.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.860]   I don't know how you don't know.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.660]   I have a Google people they tell me it was.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.420]   I was Ryan on this one.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.900]   You think it's--
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.620]   OK, Ryan, get on him.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.900]   Wait, OK, now first of all, we should say
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.660]   that this cafe califia is run by a former Google chef.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.380]   So Eric probably said, Steve, let's
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.660]   meet at my former Google chef's cafe
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.500]   and have a cup of coffee.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.460]   Steve was just deculating wildly.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.100]   And according to Gizmodo said something about, oh, they're
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.660]   all going to find out about it anyway.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.580]   I don't know what--
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.660]   baby's talking about his mistress.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.340]   I don't know.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.060]   We're not going there.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:09.940]   We're not going to go there.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.580]   You're absolutely right, Cara Swisher.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.100]   Indeed, not.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.660]   Leave it to Gawker.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.860]   Yeah, let's have them do that.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.780]   Take care of that.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.020]   This is the scuzzy stuff.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.500]   I live in the Castro of San Francisco.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.100]   If you want to date a donkey, it's fine with me.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.940]   Good to know.
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.540]   Just so you know, I don't care.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.180]   Are there a lot of donkeys down there?
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.460]   There's a lot of donkey dating here.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.660]   Yeah, uh-huh.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.020]   We don't-- but we don't judge, though.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.980]   We don't judge.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.860]   No, we do not.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.620]   Who's doing more of the donkey dating than men or the women?
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.380]   Well, you know, the man, of course.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.020]   Hello.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.020]   Hello.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.020]   Awesome.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.020]   Hello.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.260]   And then I picked the pick better animals.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.460]   This is the week that the iPad will be coming out.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.260]   I told my wife this is my last weekend without an iPad, honey.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.700]   She thought that was the gagiciest thing she'd ever heard in her life.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.220]   You sure she said-- or she went, what are you talking about?
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.220]   No, no, she knows.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.860]   Oh, she doesn't know what they are.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.860]   Of course she does.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:07.220]   Well, OK, Ston, John, you wrote an article in MarketWatch saying Apple iPad is far from
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.220]   a sure thing.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.420]   In fact, titling it, stomping the iPad.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:20.140]   Yeah, well, the reason I think is because there's nothing unlike the-- both the iPod
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.980]   and the iPhone, there was-- there's kind of-- although the iPod was largely a marketing
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.340]   scheme to get to market share.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.180]   But the iPhone was a big shock to everybody.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.780]   And it caught everybody off guard, literally with their pants down, especially the smartphone
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:33.780]   one.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.780]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.780]   Literally?
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.780]   No, I think you mean figuratively.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.780]   I mean figuratively.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.860]   I believe my pants were-- oh, we're fully pulled up on that one.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.620]   So anyway, the point is that there's no surprises here.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.740]   This is essentially just a giant iPod touch.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.460]   And so everybody's already-- they're already planning their clones and everything else
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:10:00.220]   in there and the people from the ship company that make-- I don't know why--
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.220]   Snap Dragon folks?
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.620]   No, no, not those guys, but the big boys.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.620]   Intel?
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.620]   Intel?
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.620]   Have you heard of them?
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.620]   The big boys.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.060]   You guys will make all the chips for these small devices.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.060]   Arm.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.060]   Arm.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.060]   Arm.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.060]   Geez, arm.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.060]   Anyway, they--
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.060]   They don't make any chips, but they go--
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.740]   The arm says there's 50 machines coming out with their chips alone.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.740]   But that's the point.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.900]   You cannot clone this.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.700]   Apple owns all the intellectual property.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.340]   This is the only one that could be a giant iPod touch.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.340]   Right.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.340]   Mm-hmm.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.700]   I'm just saying that they can make all kinds of-- they can use all kinds of workarounds.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.780]   There's going to be a lot of things that are going to be similar or better.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.780]   I think the only thing that'll be close maybe is an Android tablet.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.780]   What do you think, Ken?
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.780]   I agree.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.420]   I think it's a great-- I use it only briefly at that event.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.540]   But I think everyone's-- I was at a dinner party with people like, oh, it's a giant iPod
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.540]   touch.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.220]   I'm like, and the problem with that is what?
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.220]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.220]   I don't know why that's a problem.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.260]   Like, there's 75 million people that know how to use it.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.260]   Nobody ever said it was a problem.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.260]   It was the same.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.260]   And the giant iPod touch.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.300]   It's a problem, man, it's a general iPod touch.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.580]   Well, it sounds diminution.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.580]   Diminitive.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.580]   Diminitive.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.820]   The biggest thing is I'm going to have to hear for the next three years while someone catches
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.940]   up to technology about the iPad killer.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.940]   Like I had to hear about the iPhone.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.940]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.580]   Finally, after three years, there are phones that are comparable, at least to have a real
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.500]   conversation about being equal.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.380]   I mean, so iPad, whatever, you know what?
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.380]   I'm going to have one next week.
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.180]   You don't think the choo-choo is the-- no.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.620]   So Ryan, this is your beat.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.420]   I mean, you and Cara really cover this.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.420]   What do you think?
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.420]   I think--
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:31.380]   Well, like I just said, I think it's both accurate and reductive to call it a giant iPod
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.380]   touch.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.380]   I mean, it's reductive.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.380]   That was the word I would--
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.220]   if you really think about it, it really is like a giant iPod touch.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.100]   Or if you have 3G in there, I guess, you know, it's more-- maybe more like a giant iPhone.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.140]   But that's-- I mean, like Cara said, that's not a problem.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.860]   And that doesn't mean that it can't be a transformative device.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.620]   I just-- you know, I haven't really seen anything yet that makes me think this is something that
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.180]   is going to change computer.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.100]   I'm not saying that it won't.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.740]   But you know, all the stuff that Apple showed at the event, I mean, it was basically just
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.340]   kind of scaled up versions of mobile apps or scaled down versions of desktop apps.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.740]   And there wasn't anything that really felt kind of native to the platform.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.820]   And I think because of that, that might have been why people weren't super into the concept
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.420]   of the iPad, because they didn't really show anything that was-- you know, you saw it
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.060]   and you thought, oh, I could really only do that on the iPod.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.340]   Will there be things like that?
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.060]   I'm sure that there will be, but Apple hasn't shown it.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.220]   So I mean, at a certain point, maybe they feel like they have to let it go out to developers
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.580]   and then developers are going to come up with the concepts that are going to really make
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.580]   it sing.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.740]   But you know, I mean, when the iPhone was announced, there was a whole bunch of core
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.580]   functionality there that was really transformative.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.260]   And we just haven't really seen that for the iPad.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.580]   I mean, I don't think there's anything in there that makes it incredibly different from
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.580]   tablets that have come before.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.580]   I mean, yeah, you can browse the web.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.580]   You can play music.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.060]   You can do that on any tablet, though.
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.700]   It'll actually work, though.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.380]   It won't freeze and it won't-- I won't be upset about it.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.740]   I mean, I've used other tablets before and it's kind of not the same because--
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.740]   tablets have done it with Flop, really.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.740]   They don't sell.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.980]   They don't have any buzz to them.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.580]   And the only time you use them is when I'm at a bar and someone's asking my age sex
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.020]   location and tap it on the screen.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.660]   I mean, nobody's really using them.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.500]   I mean, people are going to be using these in stores to bring people up like the App Store
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.660]   does.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:22.780]   Like I said, older people that just want to pay 30 bucks, have internet, email, video.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.220]   It's a basic function and a simple product that's controlled and will actually work.
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.220]   I had two netbooks.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.700]   I got rid of them.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.620]   My mom reserved one already.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.500]   I mean, my mom is 75 years old and she likes her iPod touch, but she'd like it bigger.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.260]   I mean, she didn't take it easy for me to do it.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.940]   Somebody said in the chatroom that the reason that people are bad-mouthing the iPad is because
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.500]   it's all geeks who have the voice.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.980]   It's a bunch of geeks.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.780]   They're not going to like it because it doesn't have multitasking or camera or whatever the
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:51.780]   geek--
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.780]   It will.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.780]   It will.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.780]   It will.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.780]   It will.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.580]   You get all of those features in a half-price netbook.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.940]   If that's what you want, you should get that.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.420]   I think this is an appliance.
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.260]   This is not a computer even.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.260]   The one thing I was--
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.180]   I think we should wait and see what happens instead of speculating to the last minute.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.180]   That's right.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.180]   But that's what we do on this show.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.580]   I think one of the issues is everyone thought it was going to be like a Viagra of tablets.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.900]   Oh my God, it has to be fabulous.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.300]   I think it's just a very good tablet.
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.060]   What I saw was a very good tablet.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.180]   I haven't used it extensively yet.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.700]   If it's a decent-- it's just not like the-- they wanted something so dramatically game-changing.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.540]   I think whatever.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.020]   That's what happens around all of our products.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.260]   But I think you just wait and see how-- I don't think we know what people are going to use
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.580]   it for yet, just like the iPhone or the iPod.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.580]   We don't know.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.580]   We have no idea what could be created.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.940]   Well, if you want your live advertising to be as crowd.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.180]   I think the idea that it could be an appliance like device is actually really interesting.
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.700]   I don't really know if I buy into it necessarily.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.660]   History is littered with internet appliances.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.260]   Everything from the Audrey.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.060]   There's just been dozens and dozens of appliances.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.740]   Well, the Audrey is a classic.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.380]   That was a kitchen computer.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.860]   That's the example that you can always point to.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.860]   That's the standby.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:06.780]   But the point being that appliances are not a no quantity.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:12.980]   There's absolutely no indication that an appliance is going to be successful in the market.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:18.420]   If people are thinking about it as an appliance, maybe that's not actually the best indication
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.260]   of whether or not it's going to do well.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.460]   I think it has to be thought of as maybe that and a lot of other things.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.940]   Maybe giant iPod touch is actually a good thing for a lot of people.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.300]   For the grandmas for sure.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.300]   That's not much of a market.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.060]   If that's all you could sell to us.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.060]   They need a big type, a big print, a big font.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.100]   My mom in her 70s loves the Kindle because she can make the type bigger, it brought her
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.100]   back to reading.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.820]   That's not something to be ignored, but I don't think it's a big enough market to make
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.820]   it a hit by itself.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.820]   I think we should wait.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.660]   Well, you're the one who wrote the article.
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:56.180]   I'm just, I'm just, oh, well, I know, but the article was, well, what did I say in there?
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.820]   I can never remember.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.940]   Pre-orders, according to one blogger of 240,000, if you go to the Apple Store right now, it
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.700]   will say you can't get this till April 12th, which means they ran through the first manufacturing
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.700]   run.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.500]   Any speculation from anybody what that first run might have been?
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.500]   Probably a half a million.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.500]   That's what I think.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.500]   That's a lot to sell.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.780]   Well, it's not enough for you to win the bet yet, Leo.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:24.060]   I have a bet with John that it will, Apple will sell five million in the first year.
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.660]   I don't think it was a half million.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.180]   Half million is very, very aggressive in terms of manufacturing.
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.180]   300,000?
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:34.220]   Maybe, yeah, maybe so I would say somewhere between 100 and 300,000.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.220]   It could be wrong.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.220]   It's going to be like the Kindle where we'll just never know.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.220]   Yeah, probably.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.820]   I mean, if you think about it, I never know anyway.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.140]   It is an absolutely enormous amount of units for any device.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.180]   I mean, most major companies would be just totally stoked to move a half million units
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.180]   in a year.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.340]   I mean, I only mentioned that to put it in a little bit of perspective.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.540]   They have a nice base though because all the people that are out there that are basic
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.740]   iPhone and iPod touch users, they've already got those people hooked into something that,
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.940]   as we just said, is just a bigger unit and those people want them.
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.580]   And they're going to be lined up waiting at the door like they were for iPhones waiting
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:09.580]   for two days to get one.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:15.540]   I'm trying to decide if we should, Robert Scobull wants to do overnight coverage Friday
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:21.900]   night, Saturday morning at the, he calls it Steve Jobs Apple Store in Palo Alto.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.900]   I don't know.
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.660]   I don't think it's going to be that kind of excitement.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.660]   Maybe I don't think so though.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.900]   You know, the people like to do it just because they got nothing else to do.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:35.660]   So there's a contest held every year in Vancouver by Cansec West.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:41.620]   It's a hacker conference and they do a thing called Pwn to Own where they line up a bunch
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:50.940]   of stock devices running Windows 7, OS 10 and a bunch of stock browsers and then explore
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:18:02.460]   eight Firefox 362 Safari and they have a big prize for the first person to hack the device.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:07.140]   And already the first round of victims explorer fell first then fire.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.060]   How do they define hack?
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.060]   Own.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.260]   You got to own it.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.860]   In other words, you've got to find an exploit that goes through the browser and lets you
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.540]   own the operating system to the degree that you can put any arbitrary pieces of software
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.540]   on it.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.980]   A critical vulnerability.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.260]   And what happens is these hackers save them all year because you get a, I think the last
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.500]   one was a, I don't know what they won this year, but last year was a laptop, lap a laptop.
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.300]   So it's a nice prize.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.300]   So they save up.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.540]   You know, they've got, oh, I found a Firefox exploit and they say, I hope nobody finds
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.900]   out about it and it's patched before I can get to it.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.860]   So IE eight fell, Firefox fell, then Safari fell.
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.380]   You know what hasn't fallen?
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.700]   By the way, Charlie Miller who's done this every year won once again by finding a critical
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.020]   Safari vulnerability on the MacBook.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.060]   So he gets the top prize, which I think is a MacBook.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.820]   The iPhone was hacked.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:05.460]   A zero day exploit on the iPhone.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:11.980]   In-boxing features in Windows seven protected mode did protect Firefox and IE eight, but
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.340]   the only browser that wasn't hacked.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.340]   Guess.
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.340]   Chrome.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.340]   Chrome.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.340]   How'd you know?
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.340]   How'd you know?
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.340]   Yet.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.340]   Well, they're still working on it.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.340]   Come on.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.340]   I mean, it's like a house.
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.340]   Any house can be broken into.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.340]   I mean, I guess.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.980]   With enough, with enough people hammering at the door.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:30.980]   Yes.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.780]   Google has their own exploit program that they have running.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.460]   And if you if you can do this, they will give you $1,337.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.460]   Leat.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.460]   Yes.
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.940]   They will give you leat dollars.
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.940]   Leat money.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:50.340]   If you can if you can own Chrome and report a bug that you know is is fixable and is attributable
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.780]   to something that they're they're they had a winner, right?
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.660]   They've given away one at least one prize.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.660]   I think so.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.220]   So I don't know if that's because people are kind of going going through the Google
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.220]   program or.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.580]   Imagine Microsoft doing that.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.580]   Find a bug in Windows.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.580]   We'll give you a leap money.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.580]   They'd be broke.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.580]   They'd be broke.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.580]   It's.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.580]   They can't do it.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.500]   Didn't they didn't they used to pay 50 bucks a bug years and years ago?
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.780]   They used to have bug hunts where they, you know, have the employees come in.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.780]   They'd have pizza.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.780]   They'd stay on the campus.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.020]   And then that's where they were given their give me employment.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.020]   They never opened that to the public.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.300]   They do things with data though.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.220]   Like like my alpha, whatever, and they release things.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.860]   They give people that are certified.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.260]   Get a hat though.
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.860]   You don't get a laptop.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.860]   Hey, they give songs.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.860]   They'll give something.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.380]   A lot of hats to give an hour, whatever.
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:42.380]   According, I maybe we talked about this last week, but according to one of the analysts,
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.300]   the Nexus one last month in February sold more units than the iPhone.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.460]   Can I find that hard to believe?
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.300]   You mean it's first couple months, correct?
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.300]   Peritably.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.780]   No, they're saying February outsold the iPhone by 16% in the month of February.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.780]   This is...
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.020]   That could be a...
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.020]   That could make sense.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.580]   I mean, there's a new iPhone coming out soon.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.580]   He's there?
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.580]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.580]   I mean, it's been really quite extensive.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.580]   Yeah, I think in June.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.580]   Yeah, but wait a minute.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.380]   But every March they announced it.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.380]   Last time I checked, we're at the end of March.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.540]   You don't want to class with their iPhones?
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.620]   I'm not buying it in any way.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:24.220]   I mean, the iPhone is sold through the major AT&T stores.
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.220]   It's well known.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.020]   People are replacing older ones.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.980]   Nexus, where, how do you have to go on?
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.980]   How do you even get one?
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.980]   I mean, I don't see how this thing could have possibly outsold the iPhone.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.420]   Something's bogus about this story.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.940]   Yeah, I'm going to go with John there.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.780]   So a couple of weeks ago there was a story about...
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.180]   From Flurry, they're an app analytics company.
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:48.580]   They estimated that the number of Nexus ones out there today is somewhere in the range
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.220]   of about 80,000, which is really...
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:58.060]   It's not bad for a phone, but not great for a phone as kind of high profile as the Nexus
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.060]   one.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.060]   But that's...
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.540]   I think the thing to remember here is that the Nexus one has no television marketing
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.540]   campaign.
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.620]   It's not sold in any stores, in physical stores where people walk into a carrier, they look
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.500]   at a phone and then they walk out with a phone.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.380]   That is the, by far, the number one way phones are purchased.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.540]   So it's not sold in stores.
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.860]   You can't play with it first.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.780]   It's not marketed on television, not marketed on radio.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.700]   It has all of the odds stacked against it.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.300]   It's not moving units for good reason.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.540]   I mean, Google is not pushing it that way.
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.220]   In fact, if you say all that, it's doing pretty well.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.540]   And it's only been on T-Mobile.
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.660]   Now it's going to be on Verizon.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.580]   I'm sure any day now, sprint, sprint.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.500]   You can run it on 18-10 now.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:44.500]   It's for how much they've really handicapped it in terms of sell-through.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.860]   It's doing, I think, remarkably well.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.340]   I mean, there are very, very few phones.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.020]   Like you take the Nokia N900, for example, which is a phone, I would say, of equal kind
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.780]   of caliber.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:58.220]   And it's sold in the US and you can buy one and it's $700 or $800, I think.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.660]   If Nokia can move $800,000 of those, I'm sorry, $80,000 of those, I think they would just,
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.660]   their minds would be blown.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.660]   Yeah, I bought one.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.660]   I bought one.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.660]   I regret it.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.660]   It's not.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.660]   Anywhere near.
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.660]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.660]   I mean, it's nowhere near the Nexus One.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.740]   I bought it because I wanted to have what I thought were going to be the top three smartphones.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.300]   And iPhone and Nexus One and N900, and I was very disappointed with the N900.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.300]   It's big.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   It's clunky.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   Very responsive.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:27.540]   The MAMO operating system is not well, you know, not the edges have not been rounded.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:28.540]   They've got you.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.540]   They've got a lot of people with it.
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.540]   Yeah, I bought it.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.540]   What the hell?
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.540]   Yeah, but it's, you know, it's a nice alternative to the iPhone.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.940]   If you want, it's just a nice, the Nexus One is a nice alternative.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.940]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.940]   It's a little mini tiny, little tablet.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.260]   A lot of teens like that droid, I think.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.620]   The droids very popular.
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.620]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.620]   What about the sidekick?
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.620]   Is it over for the sidekick?
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.620]   I would say so.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.620]   I don't know.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.620]   Some people who like it like it, you know, some people love that.
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.620]   Speaking of teens.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.620]   Free is really the problem.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.620]   Oh boy.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.620]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.620]   Not a bad phone.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.620]   Not a bad phone.
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.700]   No, I loved the pre.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.620]   I was very, I really thought the pre was a fairly credible, you know, competitor.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.180]   I like the operating system.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.180]   I don't like the phone.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.500]   Where did they go wrong?
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.860]   Was it that creepy ad with the redhead weird lady?
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.860]   The lady.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.860]   Let's blame the lady.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.860]   It was the lady.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.860]   Oh, that was creepy.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:11.860]   She did.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.860]   Didn't she freak out?
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.460]   She's like the ice princess from Chronicles of Narnia.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.980]   Yeah, whose idea was that?
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.980]   That's a tip.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.980]   I don't know.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.980]   They fired the whole marketing staff.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.220]   They got rid of that marketing staff.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.260]   I was always like hire like Reese Witherspoon or someone people.
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.340]   I was going to say Sandra Bullock, but right now.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.340]   Yeah, not somebody.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.340]   That's some creepy weird.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.620]   And it wasn't, it was also just not compelling.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.460]   It was like, well, what is this?
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.140]   What am I buying here?
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.140]   I'm always small.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.140]   Yeah, there she is.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.140]   It didn't show off the phone.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.140]   And a phone is a decent, is a pretty decent phone.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.140]   It's a great phone.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.140]   It's a little slow.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.180]   It's a tiny bit slow, but it's it.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:47.740]   There was a viral, there was a viral video this week by a fan, which was a much better
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.340]   marketing effort on the pre.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.340]   Yeah, look at that thing.
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.340]   That's so freaky.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.340]   It's like Korea.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.860]   It's like, you know, like, I'm not except they're fed in that.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.260]   And they're great enough.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.460]   I think it's just a whackdown commercial.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.460]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.580]   I think a lot of people tend to overestimate though the the actual impact of television
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.580]   marketing and when you look at some of the studies in the smartphone market that have
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:13.740]   been released over the last couple of years, specifically post the announcement of the
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.100]   pre and web OS.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.140]   The problem had a lot of mind share, right?
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.140]   People knew they did.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.140]   They did.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.140]   They owned.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.140]   They only see yes in 2009.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.140]   Yeah, they did.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.140]   I remember that.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.980]   People like regular people knew that this was a phone that could be a viable alternative
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.980]   to an iPhone.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.980]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.820]   The problem is they made two, I think, really fatal mistakes.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.620]   One, they priced the phone way too high.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.620]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.740]   Granted, it was only $200, which is not unreasonable.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.060]   But when you compare that to a $99 iPhone, you know, I think most people are probably
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.060]   going to go for the iPhone.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.060]   How many $99 iPhones did they sell?
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.060]   They're really, I mean, that was a...
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.580]   Even if the pre is a better device, I think most people are not going to buy a $200 pre.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.020]   So they bought a lot of $200 iPhones.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.660]   It's too small.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.660]   Right.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.660]   Because you're a big man.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.660]   You might want to go in for the $100 iPhone, then you walk out with a $200.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.660]   Okay.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.860]   But then you're getting, you know, the top of the line iPhone, right?
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.860]   Instead of the $99.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.860]   Right.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.860]   So there was that.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.420]   There was the price, I think, was way off.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.820]   It needed to be way more aggressive.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.580]   And then there's the apps.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.580]   I think the...
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.580]   2000 apps total.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.580]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:20.460]   The time for being able to walk in the door and not have a huge app ecosystem is gone.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.140]   You can't do that anymore.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.140]   It's over.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.180]   You have to walk in the door and have a very aggressive plan for courting developers and
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.180]   getting apps on your platform.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.980]   If you can't do that, you're not going to have a smartphone platform.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.980]   Just period.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.260]   Google is pretty smart about this.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.820]   They put out Android well over a year before the first phones came out and then they did
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.260]   this big app, you know, hack and competition.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:45.100]   They offered a million dollars in prizes and they got a ton of apps ready for launch.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.340]   They're still not anywhere near the iPhone, but they're number two.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.380]   Palm is way behind on apps.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.700]   And that's a very important story right now in terms of a smartphone OS.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:01.060]   So as I remember the numbers were a pre-2000 Android, what is it?
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.060]   40,000 iPhone, 170,000.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:08.860]   Of course, the problem you have with Android is you have these plethora of operating system
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.460]   versions, which is not good for the ecosystem.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.460]   No, 6152021.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.660]   Hopefully that slows down a little bit.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.380]   Once it gets more into people's hands, that'll slow down.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.580]   I mean, you talk about TV advertisement.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.620]   That's the one thing where Apple just says, look, I got a bank app.
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.900]   Look, I got a dinosaur app.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.620]   I mean, people that don't even know anything about an iPhone and really don't care say,
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.140]   I get on the subway every day and I wish I had a virtual subway application.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.460]   I see iPhones everywhere.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.580]   I see iPhones everywhere now.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.580]   That's the thing.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.660]   I don't know anything about technology that see those commercials and say, does your iPhone
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.540]   really do all that stuff?
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.860]   So no, go get one.
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.420]   Don't switch because of that.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.860]   Is Palm out of business, guys?
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.620]   I don't know what the-- I mean, I think they get bought or I'm not sure what's going
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.620]   to happen to them.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.420]   They keep saying they're remain independent, but it's on some point, even if you have a
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.860]   pretty good phone, it's just hard to compete with Google on one-site Apple and then you
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.060]   still have a rim, which is a big company.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.060]   Windows 7.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.060]   Windows 7.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.020]   They just have a bunch of Bono's money though.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.020]   They've got like 300 million--
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.660]   Yeah, they've got a lot of 600 million.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.660]   Yeah, 600.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.660]   It's a lot of money.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.660]   You're changing it.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.660]   There's a Bono.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.580]   There's a lot of talk of Apple or Google acquiring Paul.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.580]   Why, though?
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.580]   What would they get?
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.500]   Well, that's a nice team.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.500]   What about Microsoft?
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.500]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.260]   It's the Apple iPhone team that all left Apple.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.260]   It's John Rubenstein and coming.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.740]   Yeah, I think there's some talk about bad blood.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.340]   Yeah, they're not going to be having coffee anytime soon.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.300]   No, I don't think Apple's going to buy Palm because they picked up those guys.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.300]   You might be surprised.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.060]   Why, just to shut it down and keep the patents?
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.180]   Because Palm's patent portfolio in the handheld space is unbelievable.
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.180]   That's interesting.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.060]   They basically invented handheld computing for the most part as we know it today.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.060]   They did.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.580]   And the number of patents that they have that would be valuable for Apple in their case
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.700]   against Google and HTC--namely HTC right now--are great.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.260]   And defensively, Google might want to pick those up to help ward off Apple in this new
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.260]   suit.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.260]   That sounds ingenious.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.260]   And then there's Microsoft.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.260]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.740]   They could actually use the company.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.340]   I have talked about them buying rim.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.620]   I mean, that would be the one they would be more inclined, I think.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.060]   He said to people, "Bomber, that he doesn't want to buy Apple.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.060]   He wants to buy rim in various discussions."
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.020]   I think that's for that.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.020]   It's passed.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.620]   Isn't Microsoft now just going to wait to see what happens to Windows 7 series?
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.860]   I mean, the Windows phone series 7, whatever the hell that.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.860]   Thank you, Mark.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.460]   They might have picked up rim like four or five years ago when it was at a reasonable
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.460]   price.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:38.460]   And the amount of money that they would--Microsoft would have to shell out for them is just unbelievable.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.500]   They've grown a lot in the last five years.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.860]   You could always pick up Nokia.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.860]   I don't know.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.860]   You never know.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.500]   They suppose they're betting on Windows 7, mobile 7.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.500]   So we'll see.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.300]   Yeah, at this point, that's what you've got to do.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.100]   You've got to see how that does.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.100]   It's amazing how it works.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.100]   Someone will pick up Palm.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.620]   I think it's a really--again, as Ryan said, it was a pioneering cell company.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.660]   There's a lot of amazing talent and technology there.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.220]   I think they're definitely--I don't imagine it was Apple.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.340]   I mean, we had John Rubenstein at CES.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.340]   We had a mini D there.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.860]   And he was--for some reason, I got him to say that he never touched an iPhone in his
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:13.860]   life, which was kind of--
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.860]   What?
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.260]   I thought he invented the iPhone team.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.780]   He never said he never touched one.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:20.780]   I don't know.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.780]   Who knows?
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.780]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:23.780]   I was perplexed.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.780]   Go find the quote.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:25.780]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.540]   I've never touched--I wish I had one in my hand.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.540]   Because I would have made him touch it.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   That's my iPhone.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.180]   Touch this or else?
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.180]   Windows means ahead.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.180]   Touch my iPhone.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.180]   They haven't made a phone.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.180]   They haven't made a phone.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.180]   It was a long time.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.780]   He was senior vice president of hardware engineering at Apple Computer.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.700]   We were all either he was either lying or he really--I don't know.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.860]   It was amazing that he hadn't.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.460]   He said people in his--in his--under his--bossery had touched it.
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.500]   I guess it could be because he left Apple in 2006.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.180]   So I guess that could be.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.660]   It was some legal thing.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.740]   I'm not sure why that would be a legal touch an iPhone.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.700]   I have not allowed to touch that.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.620]   Could you please dial the number for me and hold it to my head?
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.620]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.180]   I made him repeat it three times because I couldn't believe he said it.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.180]   It's interesting.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.180]   Whatever.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.900]   Well, Palms get into the point.
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.900]   I'm looking at their market cap.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.900]   It's 656.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.060]   It's actually probably including--that's all the cash.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.060]   That's it.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.060]   Well, no.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.140]   Their cash is--they got a lot of cash, but they still have--for--they have six or
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.860]   seven million in cash and about 400 million in debt.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.980]   So they're really only worth about 455 according to this calculation.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.980]   And their stock prices down there for $100.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.420]   They could just buy them like--fallen off a log.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.420]   That's a no-brainer.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.180]   It's--yeah, that's Palmer's cigarette.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.860]   Or do they have to pay a premium so they have to pay probably a billion?
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.900]   Yeah, I think it's a question at this point of also pride.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.420]   Elevation partners, you know, put a lot of money in there.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.500]   And I think 30, 40% of the company now.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   They do.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:32:01.100]   They're very, very much behind Palm for better or worse than I think for them.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.540]   It would be a really--it would not look good, right?
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.900]   It would not be a good look for them to sell Palm for you.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.900]   They had Forbes too.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.180]   They had a couple of $100 million in Forbes.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.060]   There was $200 million in Forbes, some large number.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.300]   I forget what it was, but it was another large bet on Forbes.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.380]   And they also bet on Yelp.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.340]   So they have a lot of--is Yelp not doing well?
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.700]   No, no, I'm just saying.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.260]   They've just made a lot of big bets.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.220]   Just large scale bets.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.220]   Best buy.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.220]   You should have bet on Best Buy.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.220]   Best Buy.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.220]   Who would have thought this?
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:35.420]   Beat Wall Street forecast for profit and sales in the holiday quarter and forecasts stronger
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.940]   than expected earnings in the current year as demand for electronics picks up.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.420]   Who's their competition, Leo?
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.340]   Oh, yes, because Circuit City's gone, right?
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.340]   So--
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.340]   The company says dead.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.340]   I mean, they're all this is going on.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.500]   All right, what about the good guys?
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.820]   Best Buy profits rose to $779 million.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.820]   So that's good.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.820]   So there's still a chance.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.820]   I tell you the competition is Amazon.com.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.820]   That's right.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.820]   That's right.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.820]   It's on the line.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.980]   Again, what we said about the Off, the Nexus One, people like to walk into a store and
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.260]   touch things, Leo.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.260]   I like to touch things.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.740]   That's what happened to you in Santa Monica is they found out that you like to touch things.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.580]   I know, and then they rum rushed me.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.580]   But yeah.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.580]   Touching gadgets.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.220]   Well, fries is only in the West Coast.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.220]   Touching.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.420]   You know, I think though, if--I mean, I think that the real problem is that people, yes,
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.420]   they like to touch them.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.420]   What they do is they go in.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.500]   They touch them, then they leave and they buy them on Amazon.com.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.140]   And it's even--it's actually worse than if they didn't like to touch them.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.140]   You think that in a hurry, why not?
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.940]   You think that's the money that Best Buy is making.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:30.940]   So it doesn't happen like that.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.580]   You think it does, but it doesn't.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.580]   People want things instantly.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.580]   Rumor is, by the way, the best.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.580]   You do?
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.580]   You want them right away?
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.580]   Yeah, I buy everything.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.580]   I'm in it.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.580]   I touch it.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.580]   Yeah, I want it.
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.580]   And if I don't, I go back there so I can get a song with you.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.580]   I'm kind of like Tiger Woods then.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.580]   I touched her now.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.580]   She's mine.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.580]   I'm not looking everything in the cottage.
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.580]   Stop it.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.580]   Stop it.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.580]   There's a microphone.
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.580]   My--
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.580]   I'm up with the gags.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.580]   He's back.
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.580]   Anyway.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:03.020]   Best Buy is the rumors are that Best Buy, and I guess we might have been a fake memo,
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.660]   but that Best Buy will have the iPad day of.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.660]   I hope that happens.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.660]   So you can go camp out.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.260]   Because it's too late to go to the Apple store, so you're going to go to Best Buy
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.260]   and Campout.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.260]   Yeah, Campout.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.260]   You're going to do a campout?
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.540]   Yeah, I'm going to get a tent and some hot dogs.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.540]   You're really?
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.540]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.540]   Because you know, Scoble's doing it.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.540]   We've been in touch with Scoble.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.540]   Our intern is going to be in--
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.540]   Oh, we'll have hot dogs.
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.540]   Are you going to go?
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.540]   Because we're trying to decide if we should go--
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.540]   No, I'm sending my intern to be with Scoble in the tent.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.540]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.540]   I'm going to send my intern as well.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.340]   I'm going to send my intern as well.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.340]   I'm sending my intern.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.340]   No, my intern is my--
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.340]   My intern is my--
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.540]   He's very excited to camp with Scoble.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.540]   I can't believe it, but it's true.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.540]   Oh, dear.
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.540]   There are people like that.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.540]   I know.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.540]   Ryan, are you sending your intern?
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.540]   No.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.540]   No, I'm not sending anybody.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.540]   The lone home?
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.540]   You people are ridiculous.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.540]   You are just insatiable.
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.540]   He's really happy.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.540]   He's so excited.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.540]   I can't even tell you to be standing--
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.540]   He's sitting in a line at the Palo Alto.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.540]   Palo Alto's our last year.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.540]   Last year, Andy Hertzfeld showed up.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.540]   Waz showed up.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.540]   I mean, luminaries.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.540]   Luminaries.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.540]   I've been on TV three times because of Camping Out.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.540]   From a PS3 for the Xbox and the Wii.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.540]   I live for being one day one day one day one day one day.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.540]   They walk by and they ask what crazy people are doing outside.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.540]   And I say, I don't have an intern.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.540]   I had to do it myself.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.540]   I did it last time.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.540]   I did it last time.
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:18.060]   There's something-- I don't like to go because I don't want to look at like a cheerleader.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.500]   But there is something about those lines.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.540]   Hey Leo, you're doing a fine job on the show.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.540]   Oh, shut up.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.540]   Shut up.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.540]   I'll cheerlead for this.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.540]   Have you seen Ryan the skin put system?
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.540]   The skin put system?
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.540]   Actually, I haven't.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:43.540]   The skin put system is underway to interact with mobile phones or MP3 players simply by tapping your hand or forearm.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:49.540]   The skin put is being created by a PhD student in computer science at Carnegie Mellon.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.540]   And Microsoft Research is pumping some money into this.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:36:00.540]   They project, I guess, sensors, you know, buttons on the hand or the arm.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:04.540]   And then you tap the skin which scatters acoustic signals throughout the arm.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.540]   Just travel along the skin surface, others propagate through the body.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:14.540]   And some sort of computer model then filters it out and figures out that based on that tap, you hit this button.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:21.540]   There's been a few systems like this that use the capacitive properties of your skin as an interface.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:31.540]   And there's actually been some kind of like you can draw lines of circuits on your body and then kind of interact with them with certain kind of wearable computer systems.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:36.540]   Maybe this like every year at CES, there's typing on the table or tapping on your body.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:41.540]   Yeah, I'm not really at a lack for interfaces with which to interact.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:46.540]   I haven't run out of them and then now need to use my body for that.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:53.540]   It does seem like though it would be a good way to make a cell phone more compact.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.540]   Isn't that kind of one of the issues?
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:02.540]   You know, I'm not so sure but I would really like some kind of embeddable devices that kind of control bodily functions.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.540]   Yeah, so what?
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.540]   I could tap out on my palm interface, you know, please drop five pounds.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.540]   Oh, that would be good.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.540]   Yeah, I thought you wanted like a Japanese toilet seat built in here.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.540]   I thought it was going to be a pen's diaper type of deal but maybe not.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.540]   You know, there's a lot of really close up in the heart area putting intelligence stance and stuff.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:27.540]   That's a very big area eventually. I mean, stance and various things that have a lot that give certain drugs at certain times.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.540]   I think that's fascinating area but this sounds kind of creepy.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.540]   I don't trust the drug thing either. The last thing you don't have is somebody OD because something malfunctioned in your body.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:41.540]   I went through like a check-in at the airport and next thing you know, OD and omorphing and they don't need to have that happen to me.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.540]   I don't know.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.540]   It's going to happen to somebody.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.540]   As soon as they start doing it, the first fatal flaw.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.540]   Yeah, perhaps.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:53.540]   There's some stuff for old people where it'll deliver the drugs when you forget.
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.540]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.540]   Around all time and stuff like that.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.540]   It's all this cool stuff going on. I think it's interesting.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.540]   Well, I mean, someday we're going to have chips stuck in our nose.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.540]   God, I hope so. I can't wait.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.540]   I want to know why Dvorak has that Barney behind him though.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.540]   That's really...
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.540]   Oh, that's the 1.2 million view Barney.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.540]   Oh, is it?
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.540]   That is the big boy. Yeah, he's the record holder.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:18.540]   Unbelievable. This is the thing that made me give up all hope on viral video.
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.540]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.540]   John gets this stupid Microsoft Barney.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.540]   What is it? Two or three years ago?
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.540]   Oh, you got to try 10 years.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.540]   I was unaware of this.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.540]   He shoots a YouTube video of this thing in his bathroom.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:34.540]   You can see the frickin' tile in the tub with his some stupid camera phone puts it on YouTube.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.540]   How many views now?
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.540]   I think the 1.5 million is something like that.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.540]   And you're about to add to the count.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.540]   And I just give up because I...
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.540]   How can I...
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.540]   How can I compete possibly?
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.540]   There's a bunch of people that watch this show and I keep moving the Barney around and they keep finding it.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.540]   Oh, wow.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.540]   It's a Easter egg.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.540]   It's now becoming an inside thing.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.540]   It's a Easter egg.
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:00.540]   And then the other thing that they start noticing is that I put crazy little images on the monitor back over here.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.540]   And right there.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.540]   Really?
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.540]   Is anybody will identify it?
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.540]   People on this show or people on your other shows?
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:12.540]   No, people on your show, these guys that are on that listen and watch the show of yours are crazy.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.540]   What is it?
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.540]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.540]   Let's see.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.540]   Can you zoom in on that?
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.540]   What is that?
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.540]   No, we can't.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.540]   What is that, John?
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.540]   Somebody on this chat room will get it.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.540]   I can't.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.540]   It's very...
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.540]   Anyone who knows what...
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.540]   knows that image will get it.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.540]   It's a tree?
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.540]   Nobody's seen it.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.540]   Okay.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.540]   Oh, somebody got it.
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.540]   Oh, I know it is.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.540]   It's Mothman.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.540]   No, the guy got it right here.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.540]   John Doe, I think.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.540]   John Doe, I think it was, or destroyed off.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.540]   It was flying spaghetti monster.
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.540]   Oh, it's a flying spaghetti monster.
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.540]   Of course.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.540]   Or Mothman.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.540]   The mystery solved.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.540]   Mystery solved, boy.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.540]   This is entertainment, isn't it?
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.540]   I'll tell you.
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.540]   We're not entertaining the crowd.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.540]   This is why broadcast television doesn't have a chance.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.540]   It's doomed.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.540]   It's doomed.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:40:02.540]   According to a UK professor, cases of syphilis have increased fourfold in Britain because
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.540]   of...
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.540]   The internet.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.540]   Facebook.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.540]   Cara Swisher, you win.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.540]   That's the stupidest story I've ever heard.
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.540]   Sorry.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.540]   Was that an emergency?
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.540]   It is in Fox News.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.540]   You're very good.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.540]   Fair and balanced.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.540]   According to Professor Peter...
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.540]   Hi, people!
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:25.540]   According to Professor Peter Kelly, Director of Public Health for the UK Agency, NHST's...
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:31.540]   It's because of people hooking up on Facebook that syphilis is up now.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.540]   Well, how else would you explain fourfold in groups?
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.540]   You know, Facebook doesn't cause syphilis.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.540]   People cause something like that.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.540]   Myspace had a striking STDs.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.540]   That old phrase.
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.540]   That goes by like a mystery.
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.540]   Myspace used to get all kinds of STDs from Myspace.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.540]   You did?
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.540]   I hope someone goes from Myspace to ridiculous.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.540]   An overweight guy's kingdom is Myspace.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.540]   Facebook.
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.540]   I haven't got any women from Facebook.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.540]   They can actually know about me and my friends and stuff.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:02.540]   Myspace, I create my empire and get a whole bunch of followers and fans and women just throw
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.540]   themselves.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.540]   We had a Facebook hookup in the studio yesterday.
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.540]   Facebook now.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.540]   Yesterday.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.540]   Yesterday in the studio there was a Facebook hookup.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.540]   Really?
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.540]   Yes.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.540]   Well, you're telling us about it, Leo?
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:12.540]   That's love.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.540]   That's not STD-so-friendly.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.540]   It wasn't love.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.540]   Alright, Facebook.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.540]   I'm not saying there was syphilis involved, but I don't know if it was love.
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.540]   We had a couple in here.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.540]   A couple came in to visit.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.540]   I don't know if I want to name names.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.540]   I won't.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.540]   Well, just tell us in general.
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:31.540]   But they had been high school sweethearts and hadn't seen each other in decades and hooked
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.540]   on Facebook.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.540]   And that's what she was like.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.540]   She was like, "Oh, there you have it.
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.540]   That's nice."
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.540]   That's sweet.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.540]   That's not what was blossoming.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.540]   That's something.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.540]   Maybe there's STDs, but it's love too.
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.540]   I think that whole blaming technology for various things drives me.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.540]   There's a story like this every quarter.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.540]   Some crazy Facebook is causing this.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.540]   I know, I love it.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.540]   That's why I, of course, still...
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.540]   It feels myspace or even Twitter out of the lead.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.540]   The Britney bot has...
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.740]   Professor Kelly says there's been a fourfold increase in the number of syphilis cases detected
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.540]   with more young women being afflicted.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:05.180]   I don't get the names of people affected just figures and I saw that several of the people
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.540]   had met sexual partners through these sites.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.540]   Social networking sites are making it easier for people to meet up for casual sex.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:17.540]   There's a rise in syphilis because people are having more sexual partners than 20 years
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.540]   ago.
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.540]   Has anyone actually studied this in any real way?
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.540]   No, it's all theory.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.540]   He's making it up.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.540]   He could be a friend for all, you know.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.540]   It could be just a blog.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.540]   It could be Twitter.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   I mean, dating.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.540]   It's not com or dating sites.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.540]   It's actually true, though.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:37.540]   There's a direct correlation between the spread of STDs and the presence of Facebook.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:43.540]   So, I mean, maybe it's true, but doesn't that speak more to the values of our society today
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:47.540]   and less about, you know, what is Facebook supposed to do?
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.540]   It's just a tool to meet someone together.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.540]   It's a tool to get syphilis.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.540]   Facebook.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.540]   Facebook's just a tool.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.140]   Facebook offers more condom advertisements on the sidebar.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.140]   I get plenty of them.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.140]   You get condom ones?
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.140]   I get gay cruises.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.140]   Really?
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.140]   Yeah, and freedom rings.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.140]   I can't stand it.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.140]   So, is there something on your Facebook profile that indicates?
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.140]   It's a gay.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.140]   It says gay, I guess.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.140]   I don't know.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.140]   So, you've said that you're gay and so you get- Oh, no.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.140]   I say I married to a woman.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.140]   So, that sort of suggests gayness.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.140]   That seems like they're doing some artificial intelligence there.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.140]   If I wanted a gay cruise, I'd shoot myself in the head.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.140]   They know I'm black.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.140]   They don't sound like Molt Licker advertises.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.140]   It's my way or anything.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.140]   So, I don't know.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.140]   What do you get?
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.140]   What ads do you get on Facebook?
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.140]   I get like young hot chicks.
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.140]   I get a lot of caws.
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.140]   I get those.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.140]   I get gay cruises.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.140]   Yeah, now you wouldn't mind some young hot chicks.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.140]   Whatever.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.140]   Whatever.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.140]   Let's see.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.140]   What am I getting?
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.580]   I'm getting graduate degree programs in Computer Science, Network Security and Data at the University
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.340]   of Louisville.
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.820]   I am getting Paris-Aparris Writers Retreat.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.620]   They must think I'm intelligent.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.900]   Do your most authentic work in Paris with New York Times bestselling author and literary
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.100]   agent.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.300]   And then I get the shiksa.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.500]   Do you love Jewish food?
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.540]   Become a fan of the shiksa for daily recipes and kosher cooking tips.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.540]   I don't think you got your all the others.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.540]   I just got the Paris recipe.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.980]   And sestry.com find out where O'Dr. Cain from.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.980]   See?
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.980]   They were watching the show.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:07.980]   They know where...
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:08.980]   They were watching the show Uncle Leo.
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.980]   There we go.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.500]   I was doing a little genealogy with O'Dr. earlier today.
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.500]   And Facebook knew it.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.500]   Facebook followed.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.500]   They're on it.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.500]   Their algorithm is impenetrable.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:21.220]   Facebook's response, by the way, to this British assertion.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:27.460]   Facebook is no more responsible for SDD transmission than newspapers are responsible for bad vision.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.460]   Oh, that's strange.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.460]   I don't know what I'm getting at.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.460]   It sounds like an Elliot Shrig.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.740]   I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   What the hell does that mean?
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.700]   It sounds like Elliot trying to confuse you all.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.700]   No, it's Andrew Noise.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.900]   Yeah, Andrew's in DC.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.900]   Noise noted, as Facebook's more than 400 million users know, he's snuck that in.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:52.660]   Our website is not a place to meet people for casual sex.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.940]   It's a place for friends, family, and coworkers to meet for casual sex.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.940]   Oh, no, to connect and share.
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:44:59.940]   So that's not...
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.940]   They say no, that's absurd.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.260]   No, of course it's absurd.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.260]   And it does come from the sun.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.980]   Yes, there you go.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.980]   There you go.
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.580]   Thank you, Rupert.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.380]   But Rupert's decided, by the way, to charge for the...
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.380]   Nice segue, nice segue.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.100]   I'm getting good at this.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.420]   Three more decades and I'll be ready.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:24.740]   Rupert's decided to charge $17.99 for the Wall Street Journal iPad app, which is twice
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.740]   what it charges for the web.
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.220]   So they say, so they say...
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.580]   It makes sense to me.
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.580]   I love it because of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:37.580]   The story's in the Wall Street Journal quoting sources who should know.
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:38.580]   You should know.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.580]   That would be Rupert Merta.
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.580]   That would be the Wall Street Journal.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.580]   That's my guess.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.180]   It's the Wall Street Journal quoting sources who should know that the Wall Street Journal
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.700]   is going to charge $17.99.
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.700]   I would think they would know.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.900]   The Journal is as a whole as an embarrassment right now, in general.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.940]   For the regular American person, journalism is just embarrassing.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:53.940]   But this is the question.
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:58.100]   Is how does Rupert think that he can charge twice as much for an iPad app than for the...
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.340]   He was smart thinking.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.940]   He figures anyone dumb enough to buy an iPad with a Play Any kind of money.
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.940]   There you go.
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:04.940]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.940]   I got one in.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:06.940]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:07.940]   Nailed it.
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.500]   You used to work for the Journal?
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.500]   I did.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.500]   Yes, I quit the Journal several years ago.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.380]   But I am in the Rupert universe.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:19.980]   I am a contract employee for Dow Jones with all things D. Yes, indeed.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.340]   If you said something bad about Rupert, would you get a call?
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.340]   No.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.340]   I do it all the time.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.340]   You did a minute ago.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.660]   One time he threatened to fire me and he thought it was funny.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.740]   The Simpsons do it all the time.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:33.740]   He likes to.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.740]   No, he doesn't care.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.660]   He has a big public figure and he enjoys.
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.660]   Why should he?
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.180]   I mean, look, that's kind of the...
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.140]   I think Letterman might have been the first to do this to kind of bite the hand that feeds
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.140]   you.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:47.380]   He's a 30 Rock and they're mocking the fact that NBC was just sold to Comcast.
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:48.380]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.380]   Cable Town.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:50.380]   Cable Town with a K.
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.380]   You know what?
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.380]   A K.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.380]   I love that.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.380]   Did you see the logo?
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.380]   The logo is exactly the same.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.380]   I think it's great that they...
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.060]   How many you can get away with that stuff?
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.700]   People like to laugh and as long as you don't cross the line what you're not going to do
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.700]   because it's regular television, it doesn't even matter.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:04.700]   I don't think he cares.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.620]   I can't imagine he cares what I think of him.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:11.980]   But I think he's had enough people attacking him that he doesn't care what people like
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.980]   me think of him.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.900]   But for charging, I mean, it'll be interesting to see if he extends it to everything else.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:17.900]   This is what he wants to do.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.060]   He's got a paint wall, right?
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.060]   In fact, there's a...
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:24.900]   Well, it's called Project Alicia named by his son James, which was after a Roman battle,
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:30.100]   a very famous Roman battle of Julius Caesar's, which basically they want...
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.420]   They beat the Gauls for the first time in a very significant battle.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.020]   And I guess I had written a piece on it.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.260]   I guess Google are the Gauls.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.660]   So they managed to subjugate the Gauls in this battle.
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.660]   It had a lot to do with the Gauls.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.580]   It had a lot to do with the Gauls about putting the Gauls around a city.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.380]   They're very airy, you die, the Murdochs, I guess.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.380]   So they're using it.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.220]   So it's like they're going getting carried away with the symbolism.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.420]   All I know is that all of Gaul is divided into four parts.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.420]   I'm going to scall it.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.420]   That's from that battle.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   It's from that battle.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.580]   Anyway, so we'll see how it goes.
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.700]   We'll see if people want to just trace three parts.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:09.260]   I know he was very annoyed by the amount of money they had to give over to the Kindle.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:13.100]   He certainly was publicly irked and I've heard him talk about it about the money that they
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.780]   had to share with the Kindle.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:20.820]   So I think he wants to try to get at least the value he thinks he is owed for the content.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:26.140]   Merta, at best, it's going to be 30% margin for Apple there.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.020]   No, that's exactly what it was.
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.740]   You get 70% on the dollar.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:34.220]   I think it was flipped in the Amazon case.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.220]   They were quite...
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.220]   They were 70-30.
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.220]   That's right.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.460]   I didn't get control of the names.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.860]   I think that was another thing, control of the actual names of people who signed up.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:47.100]   There were all kinds of anger over the Kindle deals.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.980]   I think they see this as a savior, which I don't know.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.380]   We'll see about that.
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.100]   Friday, News Corp announced it's going to charge for the websites of two of its British
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:01.340]   papers at times and the Sunday times, starting in June, will be available for one pound a
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.340]   day or two pounds a week.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.940]   It sounds antiquated.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.940]   It's a pound of wool.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:11.900]   Print editions of the Times cost one pound during the week, one and a half pounds on
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.420]   Saturday and two pounds on Sunday.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.980]   It's a deal.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.220]   You'll see if people really even pay for that kind of stuff.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.220]   They don't pay for it.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.220]   You know why?
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.300]   They won't because it's not that they're willing to pay two pounds for the Sunday times, but
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.140]   they can get it on the web from a lot of other sources free.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.660]   That's the competition.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.060]   And a lot of things on the web have links out.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.980]   If I'm reading an article and you're linking on my iPad, I'm out.
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:38.020]   When I read the paper, I'm stuck to read what you read to me and tell me what sources are
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.220]   what sources.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.180]   So go ahead and charge what you want.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.180]   People don't pay for it.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.180]   You drop the price.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.180]   They do their dumb.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.180]   We're going to take a break.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:50.020]   Come back with our obligatory weekly Lady Gaga story, but first a word from audible.com.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:56.820]   Audible is of course the great bookstore of audio entertainment books, comedy performances,
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:59.540]   radio shows and more at audible.com.
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:01.780]   I'm a big audible fanatic.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.340]   Yeah, I got a book for you.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.340]   What really?
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:07.180]   Listen, or two, John C. Devorak?
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.180]   Family of secrets.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.180]   Have you?
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.300]   You should get that book and listen to it, Leo.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.380]   Tell me what's about.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:19.340]   It's about the Prescott Bush, George, J.W. Bush, the George W. Bush and everybody.
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.540]   All the bushes in between.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.060]   That's because I hang out at the Bohemian Grove.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.740]   You think I might not know about the family of secrets?
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.500]   Well, I don't know.
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.500]   Mm-hmm.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.500]   It's good stuff.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.500]   It's just really interesting.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.740]   All I know is if you say skull and bones, I have to leave.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.940]   You have to leave the room.
[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:34.940]   I have to leave.
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.700]   Actually, unfortunately, family of secrets, I don't think is unaudible.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:39.700]   I wish it weren't.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:40.700]   Uh-huh.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.700]   Figures.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.700]   Because it's a secret.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:43.700]   They tried to suppress this book.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   They are.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:49.420]   However, there are many other things unaudible that are secret or not so secret.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:54.100]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you can get your first books, first two books, absolutely
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.900]   free, audible.com/twit2.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:06.380]   I'm just taking a look at the edge of physics by Anil Anath Swami.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.100]   The Nicholson Baker's newest, the anthologist.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.540]   I'm a huge Nicholson Baker fan.
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:17.700]   The pride and prejudice, the new pride and prejudice is prequel.
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.420]   Pride and prejudice and zombies prequel.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.540]   I guess there's a difference if I say pride and prejudice or pride and prejudice and zombies.
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:24.140]   It's called Dawn of the Dreadfuls.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:29.420]   It's how the zombies first came to Regency England and how the Bennett girls were transformed
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.460]   into savage slayers.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.060]   I just love, let me just play a little bit.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.500]   I just love the reader on this book.
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.100]   Hello, I'm Luke.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:44.660]   Audible Ink presents Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:47.260]   Dawn of the Dreadfuls.
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.300]   Written by Stephen Hoppensmith.
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.060]   Narrated by Katharine Kelker.
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:56.500]   Listen, her voice is just...
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.860]   Oh, I love it.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:51:59.860]   Ponzi.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.180]   Chat to one.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:08.860]   Walking out in the middle of a funeral would be, of course, bad form.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:13.180]   So attempting to walk out on one's own was beyond the pale.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.180]   I don't know what happens after that, but I don't care.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.180]   I just love it.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.180]   That's good enough.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.180]   That's good enough.
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.180]   Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:25.180]   So here's the deal.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.180]   You go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:31.180]   You sign up for the Platinum account.
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:37.420]   We've got the final four in basketball or the NIT finals.
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.420]   They've got March Madness.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.180]   You've got your own little brackets here in audiobooks.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:45.100]   If you want to play along the tournament of audiobooks, we're narrowing it down now.
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:52.340]   The third round is going on right now as we get to the final four of...
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.700]   You choose from best-sellers, customer favorites, editors, picks.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:55.700]   This is always fun.
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:57.300]   I really enjoy this.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.940]   Prayer for Owen Meany versus the help.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.740]   You know the help's going to win that one.
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.700]   It's just kind of automatic.
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:05.060]   Beat the Reaper versus always looking up.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.740]   That's a tough one.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.380]   The Gathering Storm versus the Girl Who Played with Fire.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.540]   One of the things about Audible, they do such a great job of giving you a look at what
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.020]   you could be listening to.
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.900]   It's so much fun to browse.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.900]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.180]   The new Christopher Moore is out.
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:20.940]   Bite Me, a love story.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.500]   He's a listener.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.980]   We love Christopher Moore's stuff.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.980]   Audible.com.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.900]   I'm going to make this one of my picks.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.300]   How about Pride and Prejudice and Zombies?
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:32.220]   Then for the Vampire Lovers, Bite Me, a love story by Christopher Moore.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.220]   Just a little bit of this.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:38.100]   Just want to hear it.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.100]   For vampires.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:43.500]   Because there's mostly new buildings and no one would suspect ancient creatures of purest
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:44.500]   people.
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:50.300]   So you get to get your Valley Girl vampire and you get your British Regency vampire.
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.780]   That's a nice zombie.
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.220]   Yeah, that's kind of like a good two for Audible.com/twit2.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.740]   Give it a try.
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.660]   We know you'll love it.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.820]   So Lady Gaga, baby.
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:02.820]   The first.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.820]   Love her.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:04.820]   Love her.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.820]   You like the new telephone?
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.660]   I think, you know, when I saw it, I thought of you.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.660]   I love it.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.660]   What's that to love?
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:13.540]   I'm saying her poison, pussy wagon.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.980]   I knew you were going to get there.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:16.980]   I knew you were going to get there.
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:17.980]   You know, it's so funny.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.980]   It's so funny.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:19.980]   She's just making fun of everyone.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.020]   I like that she makes fun of everything.
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.740]   She mocks B movies, prison films.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:24.740]   Everything.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.740]   Prison lady films.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.740]   Prison love those.
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.740]   That's wonderful.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:28.740]   Really, it's hard not to.
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:30.220]   You know, I have my own interpretation of that video.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.220]   Telephone?
[00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:32.220]   What?
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.220]   It is.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.220]   And it's very obvious to me.
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:39.300]   This is actually a symbolic video complaining about AT&T's service.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:42.780]   And you think about it.
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.820]   They first, they have a plug in there for Virgin, which is one of the few services that's
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:46.820]   not locked in your life.
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.740]   There is quite a bit of product placement in this.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.740]   There's a little, but she likes it with Polaroid too.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:51.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:52.740]   You're a polaroid.
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:57.100]   And then the, you know, when she leaves, the guard says, don't worry.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.100]   You'll be back.
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.980]   Meaning she'll be back on AT&T.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:03.640]   And then at the end of the thing, they have a helicopter, an AT&T helicopter flying
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   following her.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.640]   You spent a lot of time alone.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.380]   I'm telling you to protest a video.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:08.980]   I think John might have hit it.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:09.980]   I think he's spent a lot of time alone.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:10.980]   I want to watch it with John again.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:12.980]   I want to come over my house and be watching.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:16.220]   But John, let's watch it together and we can just, we can deconstruct.
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.980]   You need to see what he sees.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.700]   He sees dead people.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.700]   You don't want to see what he sees.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.700]   Different experience.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.340]   So, so, but actually that's kind of interesting.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:33.140]   John, not including telephone, Lady Gaga now has a billion views, the first anybody to
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.180]   have more than a billion views on YouTube.
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.180]   That's kind of stunning.
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.180]   It is.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.180]   Thanks a lot.
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:39.180]   You saw it MTV.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.980]   You think it's MTV's fault?
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:43.180]   No, I'm saying MTV totally blew it.
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.180]   Who needs MTV?
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.180]   Exactly.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.180]   Go watch Cribs.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:50.540]   You could watch Cribs or you could watch Lady Gaga over and over and over.
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:52.420]   I wish we knew how many unique views though.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.220]   Wouldn't that be curious if it's like...
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:56.300]   Well, I have like a thousand of them.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.300]   You have a thousand uniques?
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.260]   No, no, no, I'm just...
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.260]   A thousand views.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:01.260]   You have...
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.260]   Oh, you've watched this a thousand times.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.260]   I get it.
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.260]   I think she's really fast.
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:06.260]   She's really...
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:07.260]   It's hard to look away from Lady Gaga.
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.260]   I find her...
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:09.780]   I call her like the super talented Madonna.
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.780]   Thank you.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:11.780]   It's mixed with John.
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.300]   Yeah, she just reminds me of Madonna in the 80s.
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:15.300]   There's really no...
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.060]   She likes a lot more blood than Madonna ever did.
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.060]   I don't know why she always...
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.060]   I wasn't crazy about the MTV blood stuff.
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.060]   She's always doing things like that.
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.860]   But other than that, it's just Madonna.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.540]   But the blood is gonna be stuff.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.740]   Dance around with cones on your chest.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.780]   It's post-feminine with feathers on her face and cell records.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.580]   Don't you think the blood is...
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:36.140]   As he's a sole woman on this, the blood is kind of a post-feminist nod to menstruation.
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.140]   I have no idea.
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:38.140]   I guess.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:39.140]   I don't really...
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.140]   You know, the thing is my kid...
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.260]   Leo is trying to make the announcement now.
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:47.100]   My kids love Lady.
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.100]   The songs are very...
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.100]   I don't know what it is.
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.620]   Telephone is extremely catchy.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.580]   I kind of started humming it after seeing it once.
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.340]   No, Rosie is bad romance.
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.340]   They're all...
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.540]   My kids listen every single night.
[00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:57.540]   It's very odd.
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:58.540]   I don't let them watch the videos.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.540]   You know why I watch...
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.540]   She's a beaming dog.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.140]   No, they do not watch the videos now.
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:05.940]   She's a back-up about how crazy the videos are against the lyrics.
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:06.940]   Which are just kind of like...
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:07.940]   Boring.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.580]   Repetters are just like pop song.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:10.580]   Yeah, on the phone.
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:11.580]   The videos are just nuts.
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:12.580]   Yeah, my kid was...
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:14.740]   Wouldn't want your children to see them.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.100]   My kids got two seconds.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.900]   My one son almost got to Bad Romance.
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.100]   I caught him before he could get to it.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.100]   No, I don't want him to see them.
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.820]   Which one's the least kid-friendly Bad Romance?
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:24.820]   No, no.
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:25.820]   Poperazzi, I think.
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.740]   Poperazzi is really freaky.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:28.740]   You have to...
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.780]   You have to say you're old enough or something.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.780]   This is kind of a...
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.340]   Well, he's not going to watch it.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:41.340]   But on his iPad, he's not going to.
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.820]   It almost feels like...
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:43.820]   In almost feels like...
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.820]   In almost feels like...
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.060]   I almost feels like...
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.060]   I love the fashion on it too.
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:57.620]   She looks just like Madonna.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:58.620]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:01.420]   But I love the fashion.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.420]   How brother?
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:04.420]   Oh, brother.
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:05.420]   Alright, alright, alright.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:07.060]   We'll just stop it.
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.060]   And she got all this...
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:10.900]   Because it's telephone, so everybody was wearing it for a good tune.
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.900]   And all that...
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:12.900]   At least Barricade tape.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:13.900]   No, not that one.
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.060]   There's one where her hair is like a telephone.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.060]   No, it is.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.060]   I love that hat.
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.060]   That's a much a telephone, by the way.
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:24.020]   That shows you that particular thing with symbolic of the fact that all these burner phones,
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:28.140]   which are all these old phones that you go through with AT&T, they all are useless.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.900]   And so you can wear them as a hat.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:30.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.900]   I'm telling you, this is about AT&T, the whole thing.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.900]   Wow.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.580]   I feel the call on coming on, John.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.340]   I think we need to get it right out there.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.340]   I mean, if they're thinking it's a late regression...
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.460]   You need a parody song for it quickly.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.260]   Well, I'm sure there will be a parody.
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.260]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.260]   It is not what it is.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:49.380]   Speaking of which, I don't know if I put up today the mashup of Yes We Can and Hell No,
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:51.900]   You Can't, which I think is really interesting.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:56.180]   John Bonner, Republican representative was screaming, "Hell no, you can't about healthcare."
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:01.100]   And so they took a mashup from the will I am Yes We Can thing and just played them one
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.100]   after the other.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.980]   And I think it speaks to all the situation of partisanship in this country right now.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.100]   This again, I got to point out this is all YouTube.
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:13.900]   When lived of the founding documents, they declared the destiny.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.220]   Which by the way, this is a very moving video.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.220]   Yes we can.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.220]   Hell no, you can't.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.220]   It was happening.
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.220]   Yes we can.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:21.220]   Yes we can.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.220]   Hell no, you can't.
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.220]   Oh.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:24.220]   I think that's effective.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:25.220]   I think it was happening.
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:26.220]   I think it was happening.
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:27.220]   I think it was happening.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.220]   Yes we can.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.220]   Yes we can.
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.220]   Yes we can.
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.900]   I think it's effective political dialogue right there.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.900]   It's Cornice says it.
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:34.900]   Cornice says the whole thing.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:36.900]   See how they get a whole bunch of brothers?
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:40.140]   I have a little report to everybody that sorry.
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:43.100]   Oh, Doctor says that Obama is a half-affy.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.100]   Well, why can't I have a white guy standing there with the president?
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.100]   His mother was white.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:51.060]   Why'd I got to have some black rappers stand there to white people don't sing anymore?
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.580]   Are you saying Obama plays the race card?
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.060]   Of course he's playing a race card.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.500]   He all plays the race card.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.780]   No, there's a lot of white people in that Yes We Can.
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:58.780]   That's not true.
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.780]   That's not particularly as they go.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.780]   Later there is.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.700]   Okay, we stick the white guys in the back.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.700]   I got it.
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:05.700]   That's where they belong.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.700]   We're talking about white guys.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.900]   It looks like Duke is going to beat the boys.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.940]   It's about a minute left in their head.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.440]   There you go.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440]   I don't know.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.440]   I'm in a cottage.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.940]   I don't know anything but I don't know.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.940]   What's he talking about?
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:19.940]   I don't know.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.940]   69 to 62 for everyone interested.
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:21.940]   I'm in a dungeon.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:22.940]   Yes we can.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.940]   70.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.940]   Sorry.
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:31.100]   Just keep up for the three people out there because I'm going to be soliciting some more
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.300]   hoodies shortly.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.820]   Oh, you're talking college basketball.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:35.820]   Yes.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.300]   Oh, now I understand.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.540]   Oh, I get what you're talking about.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.140]   Let me see what else is in the news.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:44.380]   There's quite a few things I'm sure that we could talk about.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.660]   Oh, the Twitter hacker, the French guy.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.500]   Apparently, he says I'm a nice guy.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.380]   I'm a nice fella.
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.860]   He's the guy speaking of Obama who hacked Obama's account.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.860]   I think.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.860]   Did he hack your account?
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.860]   John, you've been hacked several times, I believe.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.780]   I've been hacked several times.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.220]   I was hacked once on Twitter.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.220]   That's what he's talking about.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.220]   Twitter.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.740]   Yeah, but I've only been hacked once.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.740]   Only once?
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:09.620]   John, you guys thought making your password pass.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.420]   I made my password a mile long.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.420]   One, two, three password.
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:17.860]   Well, this guy, the way he quote, he says he's not really a hacker.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:23.820]   He says the way he did it is not cracking passwords or some arcane ex-sens.
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:27.900]   He just gets answers to their secret questions.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:32.180]   He'd go online, do some research and answer the answer.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.180]   That's interesting.
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:38.500]   I wonder if by putting my password as the answer to the secret question, is that in
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.500]   me any good?
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.500]   Yes, I think that's a fair thing.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.020]   Well, there's things all there, so basic anymore is what's your mother's name?
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.020]   I can Google that.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.020]   What street to go up on?
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.020]   Right.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.020]   We just didn't.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.020]   That's what we did.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.020]   We started talking about stuff when you're a kid.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.020]   But you know what I do?
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.020]   I lie.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.020]   I say my mother's a little bit.
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.020]   I lie.
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.020]   What do you say your mother's been only missed then, Leo?
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:56.020]   French fry.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.020]   It doesn't matter.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.020]   You make up something strong.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.820]   But the only thing is you have to remember your lies.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:05.060]   It's too much work.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.060]   He's unemployed.
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:09.420]   He says I'm not much of a computer expert.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:13.740]   He says he did it at this, what they always say, to reveal how vulnerable online data
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.100]   systems are to break ins.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.740]   I am a nice hacker.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.340]   Said Francois Kostu.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:25.060]   I'm sure that Twitter people probably wouldn't agree with this.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:28.140]   He's the guy who gave tech crunch their secret documents.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:32.300]   He could have done an enormous amount of direct damage.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:37.100]   I'm not talking about the indirect damage that comes by taking a lot of internal documents
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.020]   and circulating them around the internet, but direct damage.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.540]   Actually, he could have blocked things.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:47.020]   Bring down Twitter, screw up the app, leak the source code.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.020]   He didn't do that.
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.420]   A lot of things, and he didn't.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:53.540]   It is worth remembering that.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.660]   That was not the nicest thing in the world to do.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.660]   He's a geek.
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:57.660]   He's a geek.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.520]   I don't think intended to be purely malicious.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.180]   I don't know.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.860]   He did send the ... Of course, there was a lot of controversy we talked about.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:11.340]   TechCrunch actually published these documents.
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.020]   He could have spammed them like people do when they hack into accounts.
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.820]   He did a lot of things.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.220]   He got his 15 minutes of fame.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.220]   I'm a nice guy.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:22.420]   Twitter, you have no security still with all the money in the world.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:24.900]   John, you got hacked a couple of weeks ago.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.820]   When you get to the point that he was at in the system, he could have taken Twitter.com
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.820]   and redirected it to a page with ads for him to do the collect.
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:33.860]   He was at that level.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.180]   He could have changed anything he wanted to.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:39.940]   He had access to all of their accounts and all of their systems, and he didn't do that.
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:45.540]   I'm not saying let the guy go or whatever, but it's worth putting it in perspective.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:50.740]   Google's lawyers say that the guy who leaked the confidential Viacom information that we
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:56.820]   talked about, the information in that Viacom lawsuit that told us how much Google thought
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.060]   YouTube was worth and how much more they paid.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:03.580]   Apparently, he's a Los Angeles broadcast journalist, according to the Google lawyers,
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:07.260]   named Bob Turrer.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:13.060]   He sued YouTube in 2006 over a copyright complaint.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:17.940]   There was a source of documents leaked to Greg Sandoval at CNET, including a deposition
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.340]   on behalf of Eric Schmidt, which led to the revelation that Google knew it had overpaid
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:27.460]   for YouTube when it bought it.
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:35.380]   You kind of got a little frack-ha, on Twitter, over the new Tivo.
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:36.380]   Yes.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.380]   What happened?
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.380]   Yes.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.620]   I would like to stop the thing right now.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.540]   It got kind of out of hand.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:52.180]   What happened was Josh from Ben Gadget, and then Brian Lamb jumped in from Ben Gadget.
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:57.420]   I had thought Walt had broken the embargo.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:05.140]   He didn't actually call him or contact him to, sorry, this is a little cloudy right now.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.620]   They didn't contact him to find out if it was true or not.
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.220]   They just started tweeting of it.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:14.780]   There was some, not by Josh, but some other tweets that were really obnoxious.
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.500]   They didn't actually check and actually Walt didn't break it embargo.
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.740]   He was told the time to publish it, and he did.
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:23.500]   They didn't ask him, and they didn't ask Tivo.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:27.700]   I don't know if they asked you or not, but it just started a thing.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.940]   When I saw it, I was like, "We don't do that."
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:31.860]   Actually, we're very particular about not.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:34.980]   I hate it when embargoes are jumped, and they get jumped all the time.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:39.980]   The stories I'm working on, sometimes we agree to them, sometimes we don't.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.500]   He did not break the embargo, and they just kept accusing him.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.140]   Then everyone just piled on in this strange, pig pile kind of thing.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.300]   I don't know how to explain it.
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:52.100]   It just went nuts, and it was none of which was based on the facts, which is that he didn't.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.020]   Typical Twitter stuff.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.020]   This is what happens.
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.860]   It got a little personal about some stuff that I was annoyed by.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:02.620]   Of course, as usual, I have to jump in because I have almost no impulse control.
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.540]   He was kind of mean to you, actually.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.540]   A little bit.
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:08.900]   Then he said, "All my stories I get handed to me," which was hysterical.
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:09.900]   I would love that.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.020]   That would make my life 100% easier, which is not true at all.
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.620]   We do huge amounts of scoops and breaking news that we actually work hard to get Peter
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.060]   Kafka, John Petchkowski, and I.
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.620]   That was also not factual.
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:24.940]   I don't mind having a fight with someone, but it was just not true.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.020]   I wouldn't mind fighting on the facts, but we've settled.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:34.140]   Josh had to talk with Walt, I know, and he realized that Walt, in fact, didn't break
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.140]   the embargo.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:38.020]   Also, Walt doesn't know what deals anybody else makes with people.
[01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.180]   He has his own relationships.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.180]   Why would they tell him?
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:45.500]   Let me break this down from the other side.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.100]   I know it's annoying, Ryan, but it's not true.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.820]   Maybe annoying that they treat Walt differently, but I don't know.
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.820]   That's your issue with the company.
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:55.180]   He's not necessarily with Walt.
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:59.780]   To explain the backstory here and how some of this fits together, because I used to be
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:03.980]   the editor of Engadget and Josh's new editor.
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:08.700]   When I left, and I've known Brian for years and years, and I know the other side, I know
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.100]   what it's like to be on the outside looking in.
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.980]   Obviously, Karen and I have known each other for a long time too, and Walt and all that.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.060]   We all know each other.
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:22.700]   But basically, what you have that led to this, I think, is a pattern.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:27.260]   We can talk about the cause of the pattern, but generally, what you see on the other side
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.580]   is Walt publishing early, for whatever reason.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:36.820]   Walt publishes before either before the embargo time that you've been told, or because Walt
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.820]   had an exclusive.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.460]   So we can talk about why that is no problem.
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:40.460]   There's no question about that.
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.220]   I'm sure what I missed the premise.
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:44.220]   Let me let me let me let you guys.
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:49.260]   John, there was a fight on Twitter a couple of nights ago.
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:53.460]   Josh Topolsky and Brian Lamb were accusing Walt Mossberg of jumping in embargo on the
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.460]   new Tivo.
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.180]   Turns out, no, well, they had to apologize.
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.700]   Yeah, so let me let me kind of explain how we got here.
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.700]   So there's this pattern.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.540]   It's clearly not the first time.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:07.260]   There have been many times where I have an embargo of 8am in the morning, and then Walt
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.620]   publishes at 9pm the night before.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.620]   9pm, which is typical.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.620]   Oh crap, we're not ready.
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.340]   We have to go write the story now because we were going to write it overnight, or whatever
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:16.340]   the story is.
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:19.460]   It happens many, it's happened dozens of times over the years.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:23.860]   I don't think that personally, and I told actually this the same thing to Josh and to
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:28.460]   Brian that night, I don't think that it's a Walt thing as much as I think it's a PR
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.460]   thing.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:35.340]   The PR people are a little bit more inclined to do something special for Walt or to let
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:40.580]   him publish because the journal publishes his pieces, I think at 9pm Pacific and that's
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.820]   right, midnight Eastern.
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.740]   So they say, yeah, okay, go ahead.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:49.180]   We know you're going to publish at 9pm, and then they tell everybody else it's going to
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.580]   be 8am the next day.
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:54.420]   And so what happens everybody's expecting 8am the next day, Walt effectively gets an
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.660]   exclusive, although it's not really because everybody else is talking about it.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.660]   It is really.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:06.060]   So what went upon accepting it is, we can all talk at once, nobody will be able to hear
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.060]   it.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.180]   John, hold on a second, we'll give you a chance to talk.
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:12.260]   So you're in the middle of whatever, you're in the middle of dinner, and you have to go
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:16.140]   write your story, and then everybody's pissed off at Walt right or wrong because he published
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:20.620]   first when in reality, it's generally the PR people kind of saying, okay, yeah, go ahead,
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.620]   Walt, do your thing.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:26.700]   And part of that is because PR people hold Walt in a particular perspective, and I don't
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:31.820]   think that PR people find it as easy to say no to Walt and say, no, Walt, you have to
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.980]   publish at 8am at the same time as everybody else.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.260]   And they're also a little bit inclined, I think, to say, yeah, you know whatever, he'll
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.260]   publish first.
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.260]   It's not a big deal.
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:41.340]   The other guys, they'll pick it up.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:44.380]   But yeah, the fact is ultimately I think this is a PR thing.
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:49.820]   This is, you know, PR people not say, if Walt for whatever reason is able to set the embargo
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:54.980]   to 9pm Pacific, it is the PR people's responsibility to tell everybody else that's when the embargo
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:55.980]   time is.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:56.980]   But always.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:57.980]   You know what?
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:58.980]   That's fine.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.820]   I just think, I don't think Walt's necessarily responsible for, but John, say what you want
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:02.820]   to say.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:03.820]   Go ahead.
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:04.820]   I mean.
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.540]   Well, I think Ryan actually hit it there.
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:10.860]   If these guys are going to play games with these embargoes, which is what we're talking
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:16.500]   about here, and they make everybody else, you know, not do something because of this
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.660]   embargo, it has to be assumed that everybody's playing by the same rules, not one guy, I
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.060]   guess, to go off and do whatever he wants.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:23.860]   But come on, that doesn't happen in Washington.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:26.740]   I don't care whether that's the way it's supposed to be.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.740]   And that's the way, you know, all these ethical people are going on and on about the way it's
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:30.740]   supposed to be.
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:34.580]   Now, yeah, okay, if one guy wants to jump it all the time, then the whole thing is meaningless.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.580]   So let's screw the embargo.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.580]   John, that's not true.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:38.580]   He once again, it's not factual.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.580]   He's given a time.
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:43.100]   He does not know when everyone else's time is he's told this is the embargo.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.420]   This is the time he publishes.
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:47.060]   This is an issue with the companies and not necessarily.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.700]   It just was like, it's easy to slap Walt around, which is.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:50.700]   I don't care.
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.700]   No, it's not about Walt.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:52.700]   Go ahead.
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:53.700]   That's a good question.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.700]   It's a good question.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:57.300]   If Walt is given a dien o'clock time and everybody else is given a ten o'clock time,
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:01.180]   and then these companies can screw themselves, you shouldn't write about it at all.
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:05.500]   You can't get unless you know, these exclusive deals and then putting everybody else on an
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.500]   embargo.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.500]   What's the point?
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.300]   When once Walt's thing runs, the embargo is off.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.100]   So the embargo is a big bunch of bull crap.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.620]   Well, that's an issue, but embargo.
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.220]   I mean, Ryan, tell me something.
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:19.740]   If you got an early version of something of whatever, some product, would you actually
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:23.780]   say, no, I'm going to wait until my friends at Gizmodo can have it at the same time as
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.780]   me?
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:26.780]   I'll believe you.
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:27.780]   I was even an aspect of this that I was talking about.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.540]   I think everybody acts in their own self-interest, and that's totally fine.
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:32.020]   And I'm not saying anything about Walt.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.620]   I'm saying, this is at the end of the day, I think this is a PR thing.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:37.540]   If you're given an exclusive, you take the exclusive.
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:42.300]   I think there's a whole other discussion to be had about asking for exclusives instead
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.620]   of being offered them.
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.620]   I've never asked for an exclusive, never demanded an exclusive.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:51.500]   And I think that part of what came into the dialogue here is, it does Walt demand exclusives.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:56.260]   And that is, of course, factors into when to see publish and stuff like that.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.300]   That's not even the conversation I think that is important here, though.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:02.100]   I think it's the behavior of PR people and how they set embargo times.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.700]   I mean, what's interesting is it happens in politics constantly.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.500]   I mean, they give the Washington Post things versus the New York Times things.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.980]   And I have to deal with it a lot with the journal getting things.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:16.820]   And we try to beat them all the time because we don't, I'll tell you, from the news perspective,
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.580]   they don't hand things to me a lot of the time.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:22.180]   Maybe once or twice, it's always a name.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:25.780]   But often I find handing over stuff to whatever.
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:29.860]   I mean, I think it's just that it's difficult in the review area, which is different, which
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:33.860]   is different than news where you can compete for scoops and things like that.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.420]   But that's, again, it's kind of--
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:39.380]   I think that's the other kind of bigger part here is, you know, ultimately, these kinds
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.700]   of stories are frankly not that important.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.060]   I mean, they're just, they're really not.
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:47.220]   The important stories are the things that you break because of inside sources.
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:51.140]   They're the things that everybody points to you about, you know, a review about the
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:52.140]   TiVo premiere.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.140]   I mean, that's great.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.140]   Yeah, sure.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:57.060]   And you have to do it, you know, I mean, if you're in gadget, you have to do it.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.740]   But that's not that interesting.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:03.540]   Ultimately, that's not what will make or break your career as a journalist.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:06.820]   So at a certain level, it's, you know, I keep talking about like PR people.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:10.180]   I mean, they're just causing themselves a lot of trouble because, you know, they're going
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:13.500]   to start ruining these relationships over stories that are really just not important.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.500]   Right.
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.500]   Let me ask a question.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:19.940]   Is it more important or less important in this digital age that you be the first with
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.940]   a story?
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.700]   Is that more important now because everything's moving so fast?
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:24.700]   I'd rather have something right.
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.220]   It depends on what the story is.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.780]   Let's say you're the first to have an iPad review, which I'm sure Walt will be.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:34.380]   Walt David Pogue and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, USA Today, we'll
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.180]   have the first reviews, right?
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.580]   Yeah, sure.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.020]   There's absolutely value associated with that.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.020]   Absolutely.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.020]   To be the first.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.700]   You know, I, I, there, I'm sure there are people out there who would pay a very large
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.700]   premium.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.900]   I think it's, I don't think there's any value to the reader at all.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:48.900]   I don't, I don't care.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:49.900]   As a basic person.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.740]   I haven't thought on this.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:54.740]   Well let's ask O'Doc to first because he's a, he's a, he's a reader.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.660]   Do you, does it matter to you who gets this story first?
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:01.660]   It doesn't matter who gets the story first because it's one person's opinion.
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.940]   And I mean, some people you like, some people you don't.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.940]   People watch Fox news, people watch ABC.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.660]   So hearing it first on Fox doesn't mean Jack to me because I don't watch.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:11.620]   I'm going to read Walt's review and David's review, but I'm going to read other reviews
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.620]   too.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:13.620]   All right, John, what's your perspective on this?
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:18.100]   Well, first of all, I think it's a conflict of, of interest in an ethical violation because
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.260]   it, it encourages a soft reviewing.
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:26.380]   If you, if you are given the, if you're constantly being given the, the, the, the product before
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:31.100]   anybody else, there's, there's a, there is a, a wink, wink, nudge, nudge involved.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.500]   Do you think the public knows that?
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.780]   You and David Pogg's reviews are soft.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:35.780]   And so are Walt's.
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.340]   Don't you think the public knows that thing?
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.140]   It's critical and they never will be.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.740]   So it hurts them in the long run.
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.660]   Well, I mean, I don't know if it hurts them.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.580]   I mean, they get to, they keep their jobs.
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:48.660]   I think, I think it's, you can read a lot of reviews.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.180]   You're going to, I thought review, you're going to read 20 reviews, if you like the
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:54.100]   iPod and you should, people should compete on the quality.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.060]   I mean, I was talking to Josh about this.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.420]   Josh, Josh's review is what's going to matter.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:00.260]   You know, if he does the review, I don't know who's doing your review.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:01.980]   Not who got it eight hours faster.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:02.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:06.340]   I think, I think whoever you pick the people you like in movie reviews and all kinds of
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:10.540]   reviews, and I think you just have to, you know, it may be a short advantage to have
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.020]   it first, but I don't think it.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:16.540]   That's what you see a lot in products like this, especially Apple products, not, not
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:21.620]   as much in other products, but in Apple products you see not as much leave anymore, but definitely
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:29.740]   Pogg, Walt, big and usually, usually those three getting it not, not just like, you know,
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:32.180]   a few hours in advance, but like a week in advance.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.980]   Usually it's actually a very material.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:34.980]   Three days.
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:35.980]   So, I think that's a very interesting impact.
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:39.900]   Well, I know you guys have had no, I mean, your traffic is amazing at Engadget.
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:43.180]   Engadget and Gizmodo have gigantic traffic compared to any of us.
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.180]   Well, so he's not much traffic.
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.180]   I haven't been it in.
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.940]   Well, you know, I mean, I'm just saying the people who do these things, I mean, they're
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:48.940]   doing great.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:52.180]   I mean, and it doesn't seem to, I mean, because they do a great job with all these different
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.180]   gadgets.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.100]   I guess that's my question is, does it matter anymore?
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.100]   I don't know.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:01.340]   This, this, and in fact, to John's point, it might even be to their detriment because
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.500]   whether it's true or not, there might be a perception that they are somehow getting
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:05.820]   special treatment.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:09.780]   And to someone on the ground level, you know, I don't sit around and talk about tech all
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:13.260]   the time or discuss all these conversations with a regular person, sometimes it doesn't
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:16.180]   even matter because the first thing isn't always the best thing.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:17.940]   And again, people like what they like.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:21.140]   So as soon as the gadget puts it up, it doesn't matter if it's a week later.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.140]   I care about it in gadgets.
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.900]   That's where I'm going to go to read it.
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:24.900]   And that's how people are put into it.
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:27.180]   So maybe all of this loyalty is what matters.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:30.700]   Maybe all of this writing is typical of journalists who are kind of living in their own
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:31.700]   little world.
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.980]   Yeah, I think it's a quality of the review should matter.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:38.300]   That's to me is whoever, whatever you like and whichever review you trust is what should
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.300]   matter.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.700]   And that's to me, they're important.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:43.220]   That to me, just like our stories, we have the better stories.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.820]   That's what should matter.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:47.180]   And getting it up first, I mean, you don't want to be worse at first.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:49.860]   You want to be best, but first.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:55.740]   One of the reasons I don't take review units is so to avoid that perception of being favored
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:56.780]   by the company.
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.540]   And so maybe John, you're right to some degree that that, I mean, I don't mind not being
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.540]   first.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.220]   I don't, I don't, I don't do it.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.020]   It's important to have the most, the biggest audience than it is to be first.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:11.300]   Well, but it also may be kind of something a hangover from print journalism when you
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:12.300]   needed lead time.
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:13.500]   I don't need lead time anymore.
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.260]   You know, the other thing too is you have an audience.
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.020]   I mean, I want to be first because I'm O doctor.
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.020]   Nobody knows me.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.460]   So if I had iPad that's true, that'd be good for you.
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:21.460]   Blow up.
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.460]   Be good for you.
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:23.460]   Like no, it's more.
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:24.460]   So that'd be great for traffic.
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:25.980]   But as far as quality, you've got an audience you've built an audience.
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.700]   But you're never going to be first because of course the companies are going to give it
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:29.700]   the people with the biggest audience.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.700]   Exactly.
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:31.700]   So that's why I can't call one on the radio.
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:32.700]   You guys also have to do that.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:37.700]   You have to segment the geeks that listen to this show and the people that are on the
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.340]   show typically and the mass market, which is the big audience that read the world.
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.340]   So USA today would be a natural.
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.940]   And presumably that's what the app or Tivo's PR is doing.
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:50.300]   They're parsing that and trying to figure out, well, who do we want to give it to?
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:51.300]   You know, right.
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.900]   So, you know, kind of get back to what I was saying a little bit earlier.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:59.700]   I mean, the macro of this, you know, when you really zoom out, it is just that, you know,
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:03.220]   this particular situation with Tivo, all those incredibly frustrating to be in that
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:08.060]   situation, especially because if you're not done with your review at that point and you're
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.500]   in the middle of dinner or, you know, you're just not working.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.900]   You got to run, you know, at nine o'clock at night, it's nice to be able to have a couple
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.340]   of minutes not to have to be at the machine.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.180]   And I've been in the situation many times.
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.100]   You don't want to have to run back and then have a like a rushed product review go out.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.380]   Maybe you should get it ready.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:25.860]   I get things ready a lot.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:29.780]   Like an obituary like I've been writing John's obituary for a couple of years now.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:32.500]   So when John kicks it, well, thanks, Leo.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:36.820]   When I get in bar goes, I'm going to stay a lot longer than you.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:37.820]   I swear.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:38.820]   I'll judge on your grave.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.060]   Whippersnapper.
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:44.140]   If he would all this technology or anybody who has a product really cared about having
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:49.260]   someone review it, they would find someone who's bought a similar product that they make
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:52.700]   and just send it to him and ask them what they feel about it and get a real response
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.700]   for somebody.
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:56.700]   Because if you send it to you or any kind of tech person, yeah, they're going to break
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:57.700]   it down.
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:58.700]   Some people have favoritism.
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.700]   But I want to hear from a fan and a hater.
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:03.900]   Find somebody who if it's an apple product, find somebody who loves apple, find somebody
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:07.420]   who hates apple and I'm going to get the basic idea of the product.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:11.900]   So much now it's like politics and behind the scenes stuff and you find out this person.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:16.860]   If you want to be a fan of any given product, just go to the comments.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:19.020]   Yeah, that's all you're going to tell me.
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.060]   I'm just talking about having stuff first and getting a real idea of what something
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.060]   is.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.580]   Well, this is the last iPad list to it.
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:27.580]   I just have to say it.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:28.580]   You're going to have one?
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.580]   You're going to have one?
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.580]   And if you're going to be a sad, sad man.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:31.580]   I reserve one.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.180]   Actually, I'm hoping because you know, they, you could order it when I ordered it, you
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:35.500]   could have a delivered day of right?
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:39.700]   I'm hoping that during the radio show, the FedEx guy will come and open on the radio
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:40.700]   show.
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:41.700]   Can I come next Sunday?
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.700]   Would that be fun?
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:43.700]   I might need to steal an iPad Saturday.
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:44.700]   Saturday, yeah.
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:45.700]   I don't have my own.
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:46.700]   So can I come next Sunday?
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:47.700]   You can come visit and steal yours.
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:49.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:50.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:51.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:53.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:55.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:57.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:58.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:19:59.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:00.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:03.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:06.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:07.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:08.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:11.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.700]   I'm going to get a new product.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:13.700]   I'm going to get a new product.

[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:33.700]   We completely redid our discussion system, which we've done some really cool stuff with
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.700]   it.
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.420]   I think we're going to be launching it this week.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:40.060]   Team has been just working crazy hours for the last three weeks doing it.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.860]   It's not up yet though.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.020]   It might be like one, two days, maybe tops.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:47.020]   We're trying to get it done in time for the iPad though.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.500]   A hundred new, 29 new products this week alone.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.100]   They're always adding new stuff.
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.220]   We've got a lot of stuff in there.
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.220]   That's amazing.
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:55.220]   gdgt.com.
[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:56.220]   Thanks for being here, Ryan.
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.220]   We appreciate it.
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.220]   It's actually always a pleasure.
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:04.220]   John C. Devorak is at channeldevorak.com.
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:10.660]   You can tell your minions to stop calling into the radio show to plug no agenda.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.140]   They're out of my control.
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.140]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:17.460]   I have no control over my minions.
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.180]   We would go for maximum freedom.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:23.140]   Devorak army.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:24.700]   I'm told the guy, I said, "You need a word.
[01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.580]   You need a code where you need a Baba buoy or something."
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.140]   What can we do for no agenda?
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:30.140]   Like some word.
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:31.780]   Come up with something and we'll use it.
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.780]   Then they won't bother you anymore.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:33.780]   They won't bother me.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.340]   They just call the call with a nonsensical question, which I'll answer.
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:39.620]   Then at the end of it, they'll go, "Baba buoy to y'all!"
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:40.620]   "Baba!"
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:47.260]   That's why that would be the code word for some podcast, I believe, that no one ever
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:48.260]   heard of.
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.580]   No, is it no agenda.com?
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.540]   No, it's no agenda.meevio.com, right?
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.740]   No agenda show.com.
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:53.740]   All right.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.740]   You know, if you go to channel.org.com, it's all there.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.020]   It's all linked.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.460]   We do a new video of this show now.
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:02.100]   You can watch us live every Sunday at 6 p.m.
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:04.500]   Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific.

[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:20.580]   You know, when you see the video, it's a different experience.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:23.460]   It's more and less at the same time.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:26.860]   I'm glad you let me bring a little color to the show today.
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:28.980]   Even if it's late chocolate.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:31.700]   Even if it's late chocolate.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:32.700]   Another Twit.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.700]   He's in the camp.
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:34.700]   I want a Twit.
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:35.700]   Do it on the Twit.
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:36.700]   All right.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:37.700]   Do it on the Twit, baby.

[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:40.700]   Do it on the Twit.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:41.700]   All right.

[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:43.700]   Do it on the Twit.
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:44.700]   All right.
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:45.700]   Do it on the Twit, baby.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:46.700]   Do it on the Twit.
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:47.700]   All right.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:48.700]   Do it on the Twit, baby.
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:49.700]   Do it on the Twit.
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:50.700]   All right.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.700]   Let's go round.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.700]   Let's go round.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:53.700]   Let's go round.
