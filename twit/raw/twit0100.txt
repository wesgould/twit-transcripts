[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   That was always the thing that turned me off on my journal was that mood.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   You know, what my mood is, I'm depressed.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   I'm emo right now.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   So I never did that.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   >> But I love it.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   >> This is David Carp. He's a fan of ours and a great guy.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   >> Is this the David Carp?
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   >> The old Carmer?
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   >> Carp, K-I-P, like a fish with a K.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   And T-U-M-B-L-R dot com. It's great.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   >> And it's cool.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   >> A lot of us have Tom Malillo.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   It's Merlin has one.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   >> And it's a Web 2.0 thing because they leave out the --
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   >> There's no vowel.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   >> -- put in the R.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   >> Final vowel vowel is missing.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   >> And there's an R.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500]   >> And there's an R.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   That's why Twitter really missed the boat.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   It should be a TWTTR.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   >> Right. You're absolutely correct.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   >> Actually, I think it was originally and they changed it later.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   They added an E.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   >> The problem, honestly, is all the domains are taken.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.500]   That's the problem.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   Nobody wants like a half, you know, messed up domain.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   They want a good domain, but they're 50K.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   So you just get the misspellings and --
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   >> Is that why your DIGG was the original ID DIG?
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   >> Yeah, G was a Disney interactive something.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500]   And Disney's not going to sell me their domain name.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.500]   >> So you would have liked to have been DIGG with 1G.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   >> Yeah, sure.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.500]   I mean, I would have been DIGG games.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   >> There's something about DIGG with 2G's that's got a great branding.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   I mean, it's good.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   >> It's better.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.500]   >> It is.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   >> Yeah, looking back on it now, definitely, because we were able to
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   secure the trademark easily.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.500]   >> Right.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   >> Yeah, it's not just websites, it's trademarks.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   Although, you know, there was an article in the Times a short while ago
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   saying that parents are choosing their children's names based on the availability of the web domain.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   >> It's disgusting.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   >> I read that article.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   >> It's terrible.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.500]   >> Why?
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   I don't think that's a bad idea.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   >> And they also buy how Googleable it is.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   >> Yeah, because you don't want to be John Smith because nobody will find you.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   John de Vorex, great.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   You're the only John de Vorex.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   Kevin Rose.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   >> You know, there's actually four, maybe five right now, I think.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   Four, I know for a fact there's four professional writers named John de Vorex.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   >> Wow, that's not so much.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.500]   >> There's a guy who works at the Kansas City Star.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   There's a metal urges.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   And there's the John de Vorex who works for high times.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   And it's a big, seriously.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   He's like one of the biggest advocates of legalizing dope.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   >> Oh, sweetest bud, man.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   >> Oh, it was awesome.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.700]   Hey, I see Slamdance industry is finally joining us here.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.500]   Let me get Patrick Norton.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   We've been waiting for Patrick to join us.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.500]   Hold on a sec.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   We'll add him to the conference.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.700]   And then, by the way, since it's our 100th episode, we are going to get, we have some greetings
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   from some famous people.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.700]   Hello, Patrick!
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.700]   >> Yeah, as usual, his microphone's not working.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.700]   At least it keeps it in the form.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.940]   >> He joins us late.
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.940]   You even predicted it.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.940]   You called it.
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.940]   You'll say he joins us late.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.940]   It won't work so well.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.780]   And then he'll drop off about halfway through.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.540]   Let's, but we'll get Patrick working.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.020]   But before we do, we have some greetings from some people who want to help us celebrate
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.860]   our 100th anniversary, including this one from someone I think you all know.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:43.260]   >> Leo, this is God.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.660]   Yahweh.
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.660]   El.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.260]   I love that one.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.460]   That one never gets old.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.140]   Anyway, to it, the show, it is good.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.540]   It keeps me informed.
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.820]   But then I really need to be informed of being omnipotent and all.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.220]   Just know how that works.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.220]   >> Prudhoo!
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.260]   >> Keep up the good work.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.820]   You and your friends.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.300]   Very entertaining.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.300]   Jesus!
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.380]   Get over here and say hello to the gang.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.380]   Come on.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.300]   >> Anyway, I am impressed.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.940]   There will be no spoilers about the Apple iPhone.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.220]   I'm just going to have to sit tight on that one.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.300]   It's just going to get real crazy and there's going to be a lot of revisions and I just
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.820]   don't even want to get into it anyway.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.860]   >> Quit 100 shows.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.860]   Very good.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.180]   God's not enough.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.660]   >> That's pretty big.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.500]   You can't start any bigger than that.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.180]   It's all downhill from there.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.900]   >> And that was who?
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.500]   >> You know, should I say his real name?
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.500]   >> Yeah, why not?
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   He should get a plug.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.900]   >> Yeah, because it's pretty good.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.620]   I think it's Mel Brooks, but I may be wrong.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.620]   No, let me check.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.740]   I actually don't have the names attached to him.
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.740]   I'll find out.
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.740]   I'll find out.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.660]   >> Do you have any Apple iPhone insight there, Mr. Kevin Rose?
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.740]   You were pretty right on when you talked about it last.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.140]   >> I got a few things wrong.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.460]   I don't have any insight this time.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.460]   Nothing really.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.180]   I'm going to be waiting in line just like everybody else camping out.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.180]   >> We got the date.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.180]   You've seen the ads.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.180]   >> What do you think of those ads?
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.940]   >> Oh, the ads are awesome.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.540]   Whether or not it works that well.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.300]   >> They make you want one.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.300]   Exactly.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.420]   It's actually going to be like, it's very fast.
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.940]   >> I love how they cut out all the time in which you have this.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.940]   >> Exactly.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.940]   >> It's a connection with the edge and then go and download.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.300]   >> I'll mention that part.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.460]   So you're watching the Pirates of the Caribbean and you get an idea.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.820]   You want some calamari.
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.540]   So you go to a Google Maps and you find the nearest calamari.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.180]   And all of this happens in 30 seconds.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.180]   >> Right.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.340]   >> I don't know.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.060]   >> But it's true you could do all of those things.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.540]   So I guess that's the point.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.180]   >> All of it happens.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.180]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.180]   >> 30 seconds, right.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.180]   >> Anyway, I think that they're good ads.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.340]   I think they're attracting attention.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.780]   I'm talking to mainstream people who aren't following this closely as insiders who are
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.100]   now excited about the iPhone again.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.460]   One industry analyst is now predicting a $140 stock price for Apple.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.460]   >> Oh, geez.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.460]   It's a $124 today.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.460]   It's insane.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.460]   >> It's going up like crazy.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:34.620]   >> I just wrote this call in the market watch titled, of course, is a time to short Apple,
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:40.900]   which became like the number one and two most red items on the market watch site, which
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.900]   is pretty funny.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.820]   Because everyone's reading all jacked up about this thing.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.300]   I said it's not the right time.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.820]   I think there will be a time shortly, but not now.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.580]   I think it's going to go to 170.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.980]   >> Here's the scenario I kind of see.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.900]   Obviously, it's going to take a big bump when the iPhone comes.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.300]   People start buying that day.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.740]   You're going to go up a lot.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.300]   Then you're going to start to see, and I think you're going to see a lot of this.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.500]   There's going to be a lot of backlash.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.100]   Apple's really overhyped this thing.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.740]   It's impossible for it to live up to the hype, don't you think?
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.740]   >> I agree.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.060]   I think it's like saying here, I got the funniest joke in the world.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.540]   Let me tell you the joke.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.540]   >> Dumb.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.540]   >> It's dumb.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.800]   >> I don't know.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.460]   If you get it in hand, you start playing with it, and it does operate smooth and cleanly
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.340]   and the keyboard actually works.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.340]   That's going to be the big thing.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.620]   Does the keyboard, the input actually work?
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.940]   I think they're going to sell it crazy and continue to sell.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.820]   >> They're planning on you three million in stock each singular, I'm sorry, AT&T store
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.420]   will have 200.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.580]   Then we don't know how many Apple will have.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.580]   They'll sell them at the stores.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.300]   In fact, somebody's reporting now there's a big curtain in his Apple store behind which
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.500]   we presume lurks something, iPhone related.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.500]   >> Here's another problem I have.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.940]   You know, everyone bashes me for being this anti-Apple person when I in fact think the
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.460]   company's great.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.980]   The, who was that?
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.820]   >> That was me hanging up on Patrick.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.820]   He's still trying.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.820]   All right, we're going to hold on a second.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.220]   >> Anyway, when they turn this big it on, I think Foxconn is making the first batch,
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.300]   which is Chinese.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.900]   I know that Apple's supposedly doing a deal with Quanta for the next generation of these
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.900]   things.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.580]   They're these big giant manufacturing companies on the mainland.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.220]   When they turn this big it on, if there is one batch of bad membranes or some weird
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.540]   thing, they're going to be into a million of them before anyone finds out about it.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:39.420]   I'm just skeptical that the, that this thing could be mass produced by the Chinese and
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.860]   with any form of quality long term.
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.780]   >> That was pretty good though about this, aren't they?
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.260]   I mean, initially they'll have bumps.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.540]   I remember the Mac book, the first Mac books were really awful and they settled down.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.060]   >> What about the iPods though?
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.060]   How were they initially?
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.460]   Do you guys remember?
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.180]   >> They went through, the initial ones I think were pretty reliable.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.140]   Then they did go through a bad period, I remember.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.140]   But they're pretty good now.
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:06.140]   I mean, when you sell 25 million in six months, you're going to have some bad ones.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.100]   The fact that people aren't going to scream a bloody murder means that they've got a pretty
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.100]   good success rate, don't you think?
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.620]   I don't see a lot of people complaining about their iPods.
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.500]   >> No, I don't think it's nearly as complicated as it is.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.500]   This phone.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.500]   >> Well, that's true.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.540]   The phone's got touch screen.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.100]   Why is it not have HSDPA?
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.300]   Why is it edge?
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.340]   >> Because it's singular.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.140]   >> No, singular has a high speed 3G network.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:38.140]   >> Yeah, but even if it's only in 10 cities, you should put it in.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.140]   >> I think the radio must cost too much.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.860]   >> I think it's a hard work to actually.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.020]   >> Hey, Patrick Norton, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.860]   >> Yeah, no, I think a lot of it's that they're working out probably battery issues.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.660]   And I just don't see them.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.660]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.660]   It's a first generation product.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.740]   They can hit 90% of the audience without having the high speed.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.460]   >> Can you turn Patrick up for me?
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.940]   >> Patrick needs to turn himself up.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.820]   >> Hold on one sec.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.180]   >> While Patrick's turning himself up.
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.220]   >> He does that all the time, but I mean, I'm talking about the volume of his voice.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.120]   >> Let's get another greeting.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.980]   This is from the creator of Drupal.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.380]   >> Hey, Leo.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.620]   My name is Dries Bhattast and I'm the founder and project lead of Drupal, the open source
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:21.340]   content management system that powers the Twit TV website.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.260]   Just wanted to congratulate you with episode 100.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.260]   Bye.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.260]   >> Great to hear from Dries.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260]   >> Yeah, I need to talk to that guy.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.260]   >> Drupal is amazing.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.300]   >> I've been playing with Drupal.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.300]   It's a good product.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.420]   I'm still a WordPress user and I use Joomla.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.460]   And I'm better at both of those than I am with Drupal.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.740]   I think Drupal is hard.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.340]   It is, but you get what you don't pay for.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.260]   All of those are free, I should say.
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.260]   WordPress is fantastic.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.140]   But Drupal is just very, very flexible.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.460]   And you know, we've been dug a number of times.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.740]   In fact, when the Twit site launched with its new Drupal implementation, I didn't do
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.740]   any testing or anything.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.100]   I just rolled it out and it was dug immediately.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.060]   And I don't know, we got hundreds of thousands of visitors in the first 24 hours.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.300]   And I didn't even know it was, there was no slowdown at all.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.660]   It caches brilliantly.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.340]   So I'm very happy with how it scales.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.980]   I think it's a really good product.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.580]   >> Hey, can you guys hear me now?
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.260]   >> Yes, and we hear you beautifully.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.260]   >> Oh, good.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.420]   >> Anyway, welcome, Patrick.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.540]   And now we've got the, you know, I think the kind of the core group here, David Prager
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.100]   and Roger Chang couldn't make it.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.540]   But these are the four folks who really are Twit.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.460]   And for our 100th episode, I thought it'd be fun to have them back again.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.220]   So it's good to have you all on.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.060]   We've been talking about the iPhone, Patrick.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.780]   You think it's a, well, first of all, let's talk about battery.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:43.500]   I have a Nokia N95, which I love, the thing four hours, and I'm searching for power.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.100]   But at least I could buy a second battery and put it in, can't do that with the iPhone.
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.100]   >> Yeah, it'll be, I mean, I think probably the first accessories are going to ship for
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.780]   it, it'll be like snap on, you know, extra battery adapters.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.260]   >> Yeah, I just, yeah.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260]   Although you still can't buy a proper car adapter for the MacBook.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.940]   So if it's got a magnetic charger, who knows how long it could be before a car adapter comes
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.940]   out.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.180]   >> You think the MagSafe on there, if that's what I hate about the MagSafe, it's patented
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.020]   and only Apple can make a MagSafe or Apple licensee.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.100]   And I don't think they've licensed it to anybody.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.100]   >> They have not.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.180]   I was trying to find a car charger for a while.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.180]   >> That makes me angry.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.420]   >> Yeah, it's disappointing.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:28.660]   So it's the M4V, you know, video extension, you know, I want to see that go to straight,
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.700]   you know, move or H that just a regular move file would be really nice.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.900]   >> Well, you're talking about how all the problems you have with DLTV get on the different
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.260]   file formats you mean or?
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:42.580]   >> Well, no, because basically there's, instead of just using a regular move file or, or,
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.780]   or they have the H4V, M4, I can't even think of the name.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:47.780]   >> H.264.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:48.780]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.220]   >> Well, it's H.264, but they have a special three-letter extension that basically means
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.260]   it only plays on iPods and in iTunes.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.100]   >> Can't you just put name in MOV?
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.020]   >> You can, but it's a long story.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.460]   I don't want to get into it.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.460]   >> Okay.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.460]   And a painting.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.460]   >> Like a whole show.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.460]   >> A whole show on that.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.460]   >> Way too inside baseball.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.740]   >> A whole show on that.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.460]   >> So how many of you will be waiting in line?
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.140]   Kevin, you said you're going to wait in line for the iPhone.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.140]   You're going to be there.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.540]   >> Yeah, I think I'm going to camp out and actually Alex and I are going to do a
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.820]   Ignatian, like, hang out in Palo Alto.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.820]   >> Awesome.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.340]   At the Apple Store or the ATD Store?
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.340]   >> At the Apple Store.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.900]   >> I think they'll have more of them.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.780]   Now, we know John C. de Vorac will not be waiting in line because he wouldn't wait
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.780]   in line for anything.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.780]   >> I'd hire, if I wanted to hire somebody to wait in line for me.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.780]   >> Would they?
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.780]   >> But won't he, it's silly to wait in line.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.780]   >> Won't Apple send you one?
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.260]   >> You know, I haven't asked them.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.260]   I doubt it.
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:37.460]   I mean, they might, you know, I just haven't pursued it.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.460]   >> You've been so strong.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.460]   >> I probably should.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.260]   I mean, what I'll do is I'll just, you know, one of you guys will have three of them and
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.820]   I'll borrow one for a couple of days.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.780]   And you know, I'll give it back to you and that'll be the end of it.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.460]   >> I've got my AT&T SIM card just here in my hot little hand waiting, just waiting up.
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.900]   >> Can you put it, can you put SIM cards into this thing?
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.620]   >> Right, yeah, it's a GSM phone.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.620]   >> But where do they go?
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.620]   Is there a little slot?
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.620]   >> Well, there's got to be, otherwise it wouldn't work.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.620]   >> Ask us on the 29th.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.500]   >> There's got to be.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   That's a good question.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.580]   I mean, I don't see this obvious love.
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.580]   It's got to be.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580]   >> I don't know.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.380]   You can require an entirely new, you know, sort of some sort of strange internal SIM card
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.420]   that requires a special registration.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:18.620]   >> It does require a two year AT&T contract, but for the five or $600, you also have to
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.620]   have the contract.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.220]   And nobody knows yet how much the data plan is going to cost AT&T.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.220]   >> That's fortunate.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.220]   I guarantee it.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.660]   >> Yeah, at least for the bucks a month.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:30.060]   They're existing data plan, unlimited data plan for PDAs is 40 bucks a month.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.380]   >> Yeah, I pay 50 for my blackberry.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.740]   And that's without phone.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.740]   >> That's a great--
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.740]   >> That's a great--
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.740]   >> That's a great--
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.740]   >> That's a great--
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.740]   >> That's a great--
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.740]   >> That's the way I see it.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.740]   >> Too much.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.740]   Too much.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   Anything else to say about the iPhone before we move on?
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.900]   >> I hear they're going to announce that-- well, there's a rumor that they're going
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.420]   to announce an SDK on Monday at the WWDC.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.340]   >> So that people can develop third party apps?
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.340]   >> Right, exactly.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.980]   >> That's a shocker because Steve said no third party apps.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.780]   >> Right, but then it came back to maybe at the de-conference.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.660]   >> Yeah, I've actually seen some of the presentations that are supposed to go up.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.380]   It's kind of less of an SDK than something to translate existing OS 10 apps.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.860]   >> Because it is OS 10.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.820]   He did say it's OS 10 for sure.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.820]   >> Yes.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.620]   >> I mean, putting third party apps is very important, although I understand why jobs
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.780]   would be reluctant to because-- and he says this.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.660]   I want to make sure that the experience is flawless out of the box.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.740]   And that's really where you could screw a phone up quick is putting on, you know, that
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.380]   hard implementation that crashes.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.140]   >> What kind of third party apps-- this is a phone for God's sake.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.140]   >> Oh, man, I got mine on the--
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.620]   >> We know about the breakout.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.220]   >> Jai-ku, you've got to put on--
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.220]   >> Yeah, the battery life is going to really have a--
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.380]   >> Sure, so it has Wi-Fi built in, so you definitely have to Skype for the free phone
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.380]   calls.
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.620]   >> Skype, or Fring, I use Fring on my Nokia, which is a Skype.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.980]   It uses Skype, Chateau, Fring.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.980]   >> I love Fring.
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.820]   >> That's a great name, actually.
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:55.620]   >> Then you could use any SIP, Gizmo, Skype, or Google Talk on your phone.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.740]   >> I'm sure AT&T appreciates all this.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.740]   >> That's a great job.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.420]   >> Yeah, that's the first thing they're not going to allow on there.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.420]   Skype.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.420]   So it's got Wi-Fi.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.420]   I didn't know it had Wi-Fi.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.940]   >> Yeah, that's what chews up the battery.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.580]   Apparently, you turn that thing on and you're done in three hours.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.300]   >> So I don't mind so much if it doesn't have a 3G data as long as it has Wi-Fi, right?
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.940]   Especially because it's got Safari.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.180]   So I can even open a browser and type in a password or whatever.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.180]   >> Oh, brother.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.700]   >> So let's go to some news stories here.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.580]   >> Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at the De-conference make nice nights with each other.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.420]   >> They look like two old men and rocking chairs on a porch.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.060]   >> I think Bill has a man crush on Steve.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.740]   Boy, that killed the-- maybe we should say--
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:41.060]   >> Well, he did say he's always admired Steve's sense of style.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.060]   >> Style.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.620]   >> The product he brings, the elegance to the products he brings to market.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.220]   >> And that was when they said, what do you admire about the other guy?
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.380]   And what did Jobs say about Gates?
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.100]   >> Well, you know what Jobs said about Gates?
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.220]   He says he invented the software business.
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.220]   >> Well, there he is.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.220]   >> So, it's unbelievable.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.220]   He says he had the first software firm.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.380]   He says, well, what I liked about Bill, he did the first software company.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.420]   And I'm thinking, what about digital research where he put his software so it could even
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.020]   run in the first place?
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.460]   And what about these guys that will go back 20 or 30 years?
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.700]   How does he, the first-- meanwhile, Gates refuses to deny.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.700]   He doesn't say anything.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.540]   He just takes it like a great compliment.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.540]   >> Oh, gosh.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:16.540]   I saw that.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.540]   [buzzer sounds]
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.540]   >> I'll tell you.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.540]   >> Well, he's kind of the-- he's the Henry Ford, I think of--
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.540]   >> The first company based on software.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.540]   >> That's not the same as being the--
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.900]   >> That's like saying the Henry Ford invented the internal combustion engine.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.900]   >> I would say--
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.100]   >> Well, let me present a better analogy than inventing software.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.100]   >> I agree.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.740]   >> Certainly invent the modern software company.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.740]   >> I didn't say that.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.380]   He said he was the first software company.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.500]   >> And the worst software company name in history.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.500]   >> No.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.500]   >> I mean, really?
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.980]   Now, we're all used to Microsoft, but please, is that a good name?
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.060]   >> No, I think the quid pro quo here is that it's some during the next in the D or the
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.380]   F conference, so whatever one they're going to do next.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.380]   >> Gee.
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.380]   >> I think these are the grades, right?
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.380]   They got a D.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.380]   >> Gee.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.980]   >> Anyway, the next conference, whatever grade they give that one, Bill has to say that
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.340]   Steve invented-- not the personal computer, but Steve invented the computer.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.340]   >> [laughs]
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.420]   >> And that's right.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.420]   That's only fair.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.420]   >> Yeah, that's only fair.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.580]   >> And in the same way, I mean, I think Steve was the kind of the Henry Ford of the personal
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.580]   computer industry.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.580]   I mean, that's fair.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.420]   They're both-- they're both pioneers in the industry, and that's why--
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.740]   you know, they don't like they need the attention.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:29.100]   >> Don't-- you don't want to be-- you don't want to be a Microsoft most valuable professional
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:37.660]   making software to improve Visual Studio because Microsoft might get upset and even threaten
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.660]   you.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.060]   Did you read this and this is in the register?
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:51.100]   .NET hobbyist Jamie Canzdale, improved Visual Studio, Microsoft writes to him saying you
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.900]   violated the license agreements and you're in trouble.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.820]   We're going to sue you, even though he's an MVP and everybody loves him because he did
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.660]   such a nice thing.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.660]   He's got a--
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.180]   >> Well, you know, the problem here is obvious that this is like the fact that he did this
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.100]   in the first place, smacks of open source.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.900]   >> Oh, heaven for fend.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.340]   Hey, what happened to the open source threats that Microsoft was making?
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.780]   Those lawsuits, nothing, right?
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.300]   They never mentioned what the patents were and then just kind of went away.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.140]   >> I guess they were designed to scare one person.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.100]   >> That scared me.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.180]   Patent offices have proved a new Amazon patent.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.660]   Did you see this?
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:40.100]   Amazon is extending its one-click patent to extend to not just buying stuff, but to giving
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.100]   gifts.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.100]   >> Oh, please.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.460]   These guys in these patents.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.940]   Who uses the one click?
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.940]   That's what I want to know.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:47.940]   >> I do.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.940]   >> I do.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.940]   >> Wow.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:50.940]   No idea.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.940]   >> I had no idea.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:52.940]   >> I had no idea.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.940]   >> I had no idea.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:54.940]   >> I had no idea.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.940]   >> I had no idea.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:56.940]   >> I had no idea.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.940]   >> I had no idea.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.940]   >> Oh, it's great.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.940]   >> So you just click and then it just shows up.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.940]   It's one click.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.940]   >> Yes.
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.940]   I've spent more money that way.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.940]   And then if you get Amazon Prime, it shows up in two days.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:06.940]   >> Wow.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.940]   You guys use Amazon?
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.940]   >> Oh, I don't know about that.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.940]   That's cool.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.940]   >> Oh, man.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.940]   >> I haven't bought anything from Amazon.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.940]   The last thing I used to do Amazon was like S3, which is their storage thing.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:14.940]   >> Well, that's a cool solution.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.940]   >> No, no, don't get me in trouble.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.940]   >> Kevin Rose, starting the CD at small.
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.940]   >> Serial entrepreneur, Kevin Rose.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.940]   >> What?
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.940]   >> Well, Kevin knows something about this music site deal.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.940]   The CBS bought Last FM because when that story showed up, we're talking about this just
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.940]   before we started the show.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.940]   Kevin, tell us about these guys.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.940]   >> I like it.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.940]   >> It's a radio.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.940]   Internet radio, right?
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.940]   >> This is nothing.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.940]   >> Oh, go ahead.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.940]   >> Well, Last is great.
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.940]   There's a few different uses for it.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.500]   I have the application installed on OS 10 and basically what it does is it watches what
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:53.300]   I'm listening to inside of iTunes and it monitors that and reports it back to their website.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.300]   So it's constantly watching what you're listening to.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.140]   You go to your profile at Last FM and it'll show you what you've listened to throughout
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.900]   the last week or the month.
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.980]   And then it starts making recommendations of other music I might like based on what
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:04.980]   I've heard in the past.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.300]   >> Now, those recommendations based on what other people like you are listening to or
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.300]   >> Right, exactly.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.340]   And what I've listened to myself.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.300]   So I can go and launch the application and hit play and it'll start playing like CD,
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:22.100]   almost CD quality music without any commercials and just, you know, I sit there and I can click
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.580]   on the little heart if I love it.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.740]   I can click on the band if I hate it and I just, it starts to customize and it gets
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.340]   better and better with time.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.940]   >> $280 million CBS bought it for.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.940]   And so they're trying to kill it?
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.100]   No, I don't think they're going to kill it.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.020]   See what their, see, I was like, oh, yes, he's a radio business.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.020]   >> I know.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.020]   >> I know.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.020]   >> I know.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.340]   >> There's a bunch of CBS radio stations in San Francisco that are kind of painful.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.340]   I'm just.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.460]   >> Yeah, but there's something really interesting that's going on behind the scenes that they
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.700]   don't really come out and talk about that often.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:58.500]   I was at a conference here just a couple months ago where I was listening to one of
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.100]   the tech guys speak about what they're doing behind the scenes to kind of monetize the
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.460]   platform.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.340]   And what they're doing is they're watching what you listen to and they report that back
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.340]   to the servers.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.180]   They're like, oh, I'm not sure what you're listening to, but how far you listen into a
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.180]   track.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.940]   And so they can tell at what point you said, ah, I hate this tracking, decide to skip
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.940]   it.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.100]   And they can sell that information back to the record labels.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.820]   They can introduce new tracks from the record labels and inject them into a stream based
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.900]   on what you've been listening to and see kind of what the uptake is based on your demographic.
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.860]   There's a lot of really cool stuff that they can do and they can sell to make this thing
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.860]   profitable.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.460]   >> Are you using the word cool as in sinister?
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.940]   >> Well, I mean, if it's all anonymous, I personally don't care.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.340]   But, you know, even if it was, they were reporting that it was me, like, what are they going
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.340]   to do?
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.340]   Who can't?
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.940]   I get frustrated sometimes when everyone wants to stay so anonymous.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.500]   >> You listen to, man, I'm going to try to say record.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.500]   >> Yeah, that's fine.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.540]   >> You guys watch the movie V for Vendetta?
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.540]   >> No?
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.540]   >> So what?
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.540]   >> What point do they club that guy for doing the parody?
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.540]   I think that's going to happen.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.540]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.540]   >> Oh.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.180]   >> Anyway, so you think this is a good buy?
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.060]   CBS is focusing on the community, by the way, not so much on the music.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.260]   They say this is a fast-growing community.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.260]   We think that's worth money.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.260]   >> I mean, and there's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.660]   I mean, when you go to the website, when it knows what you've listened to, it starts
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.140]   saying, okay, there's an upcoming concert in the area based on, you know, you've been
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.220]   listening to a lot of the knife tracks lately.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.260]   We want to let you know they're playing in two weeks.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.500]   >> Seems like this would synergize well with radio properties, actually.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.500]   >> It's pretty cool.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.580]   >> I mean, if you listen to the radio and streaming music on the radio, you know, let's
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.220]   say you listen to, what is the CBS station in San Francisco, Alice, right?
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.780]   So you're listening to that, Alice, and you're listening to the streaming version of Alice.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.380]   You could have some of those last FM capabilities built into that.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.380]   I think that's pretty cool.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:58.580]   >> Could this also help them get around the expense of streaming audio in the United States
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.780]   from their individual radio stations?
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.780]   If the--
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.300]   >> Well, that's the interesting thing.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:11.180]   This is a British company, and they're not susceptible to these new royalties.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:16.060]   Although I talked to Tim Westergren of Pandora, which is a similar system that is in the US,
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.340]   and he said, you know, don't think that last FM is protected because they're in Britain,
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:24.060]   really, these new royalty rules will ultimately affect everybody who does business in the
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.060]   US.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.300]   So they're not off the hook for that.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.260]   You know, that's been put off now to July 15th.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.380]   I wonder if that's going to actually happen.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.780]   >> We're talking about those new royalty arrangements.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.980]   John, you said they made a mistake.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.460]   They didn't expect the copyright office to agree to them.
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.620]   >> Yeah, I think this is going to be interesting.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.620]   I mean, I know they'd like to do stuff like this more often.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:52.620]   You know, to gouge the customer and ruin their own business because there's-- I think they're,
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.620]   I guess they're masochists.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.620]   I'm not absolutely sure what they're thinking.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.620]   >> What do they have to?
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.620]   >> But, you know, I don't think it's going to ruin that.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.620]   >> I don't think it's going to ruin that.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.900]   >> The first psychology of how to do business.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:04.020]   Just gouge our customers, make it clear that we hate them, and then do what we can to destroy
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.900]   our own industry.
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.300]   It's a really weird kind of business practice, but maybe there's an end game I'm not aware
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   of.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.300]   Not sure.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:18.860]   >> You have an interesting column in the CBS and your market watch.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.420]   Does that CBS still or no?
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.820]   >> No, it's Dow Jones.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.820]   >> All right.
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.820]   >> So they took it--
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.820]   >> Which soon will be--
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.580]   >> They wanted to sell it to CBS and then the deal, you know, the just Dow Jones came up
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.900]   with more money and then they-- I mean, the whole plan, as far as I can tell, I don't
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.020]   know for sure, but Larry Kramer's idea because he's-- they were tight with CBS all those
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.020]   years and they were a part owner and then we're going to give the whole thing to CBS.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.420]   But since it's a public company, these other guys came in with a bigger bid and CBS couldn't
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:49.260]   get up to the same numbers and so they ended up selling it to Dow Jones, which, you know,
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.100]   is fine, but not for the guys who, you know, had to scheme.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.380]   >> CBS is interesting.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.580]   So they acquire Last FM.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:02.540]   They bought Wall Strip, which is a kind of a small, but good, I think, video podcast
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:07.300]   about Wall Street for 5 million.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.460]   Are they-- I mean, this is--
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.460]   >> You're going to sell Twit?
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.460]   >> Or.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.020]   >> Let's see, well, that's only one podcast.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.380]   I think it should be worth 60, don't you?
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.380]   >> You know, at least--
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.580]   >> I'm not for sale.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.900]   I don't want to sell.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.420]   I like what I'm doing.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.740]   I don't want to work for nobody.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.020]   That's what I'm just here to have a good time.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.660]   >> So what are the-- now here's a story that came.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.420]   Have universities respond to decline in computer science students?
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.420]   This is a-- I mean, is anybody shocked that there's a decline in computer science students
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:39.660]   after they, you know, basically gave the business of the Indians and the outsorcers and the H1Bs?
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.300]   >> People are still pissed off about the H1B situation.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.780]   Donna Dibinski was talking about that when I was back at my reunion.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.020]   >> What, she wants more?
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.100]   >> They want more-- yeah, they're not--
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.060]   >> Yeah, well, that's what's killed this computer science student to begin with.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.180]   It's like a vicious circle in the wrong direction.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.660]   >> So explain what the H1Bs are.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.660]   >> But it was the H1B's are.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.220]   >> The whole moment followed by the dot-- you know, the whole dot bomb that kind of killed
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.220]   off people enrolling in computer science.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.220]   >> Well, it's back.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.300]   When you want to be in computer science now, this is like-- I mean, it couldn't be better.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.540]   >> Yeah, but the people who are graduating now--
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.540]   >> Well, that was four years ago.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.060]   >> I mean, 2000, 2001, and looking at all their, you know, brothers and sisters and cousins
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.060]   who--
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.060]   >> I know.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.460]   >> I was just at my son's sixth grade promotion ceremony and everybody wanted to be a veterinarian.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.460]   So I think that that's the next big thing.
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.460]   And marine biologist--
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:30.020]   and you know, actually, I was a little disheartened that nobody in his class of 60 kids said,
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.100]   you know, scientist, computer scientist, tech, not nothing.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.860]   Why are there more geeks?
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.260]   >> I don't know.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:44.100]   There's no-- I think it has a lot to do with the leadership of the country.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:49.020]   You know, it's just-- the country's run by lawyers and professionals and, you know,
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.980]   there's no science emphasis on science.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.580]   It's, you know, it's-- I don't know, it's just terrible.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.420]   >> Yeah, but do you think you really want to know, you know, you want to be geeked by
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   sixth grade?
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.860]   I think that comes like-- you know, you like video games--
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.860]   >> It's like being gay.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.620]   You don't really realize till you're 13 or 14.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.260]   >> Why not know till you're a little bit older?
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.260]   >> It's true.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.420]   >> You know, I'm not sure, but yeah, I guess you want to be a fireman when you're that
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.340]   young, you know, or something like that.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.340]   >> I guess.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.340]   >> But astronaut--
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.260]   >> I think we need to work hard and make it be like an astronaut or something like that.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.300]   >> I don't think-- but why do scientists-- orientates towards science have to be, quote,
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.300]   unquote, geek.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.300]   I mean, what is that?
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   >> It isn't, no.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   And science is it.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.140]   It's science was all about.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.140]   >> I mean, I really--
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.140]   >> That's nonsense.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.700]   >> I'd like to see more kids be into science and, I mean, look, technology is just science
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.700]   applied.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.940]   >> I don't know.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.820]   You know, if you start searching around on Google on this, what's kind of funny is you
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:43.260]   see like 2005 Gates worried about the client and US computer scientists, you know, you
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.580]   know, DBA administrators did an article on this, I think in 2002.
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.220]   >> So it's been going on for a while.
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.180]   >> Yeah, but I mean, this is also kind of like--
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.860]   this is the worst generation of young people in America.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.020]   >> It's just more-- they want-- this is the way to pitch more H1B visas.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.020]   >> Yeah, and it's been--
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.020]   >> I think it's a scam.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.300]   >> Well, it's been falling since like 2000, you know, probably before that.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.220]   >> Yeah, let's take the funding away.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.700]   Let's de-emphasize it.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.220]   Let's let everybody come in and then work cheap and then make sure that everyone who's
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:15.280]   been in that business gets fired or has to train somebody that works for half amount--
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.780]   half amount of money.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.700]   And then let's offshore everything we can and let's decimate the industry and then go,
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.900]   "Oh, it's just funny.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.500]   Nobody wants to go into this anymore.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.180]   I guess we need some more H1Bs."
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.940]   >> Let's bring in more Indian computer scientists.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.740]   >> You know, I got to be honest with you, I think this is mostly a reaction around 2000
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:38.980]   to the dot bomb and people started, you know, people started being told, you know, this
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.260]   computer science thing isn't the way to go.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.020]   I realize there's an irrational relationship between--
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.020]   >> Yeah, but Patrick--
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.020]   >> Patrick, if you're going to--
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.060]   >> Patrick, if you're going to use that logic, why didn't the same thing happen to the guys
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:53.060]   who were really burned in the 2000 dot bomb situation with the MBAs?
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.540]   >> Well, I'm looking at the--
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.580]   >> Yeah, well, because, you know, don't even get me started on MBAs.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.380]   >> There's always a market for venture capitalists.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.820]   >> Well, there's always a market for Harvard MBAs.
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.540]   You know, and there's some other top tier schools and everybody else is slogging it out
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.100]   in the pits to prove they've got their chops.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.540]   But I mean, look at-- here's another one.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.180]   Between the fall of 2000 and the fall of 2004, the percentage of computer science majors
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.380]   dropped by 60%.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:19.020]   And now it's 70% lower than its peak in the early 1980s.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.540]   >> You know what I mean?
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.540]   >> They got a chance of languages--
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.540]   >> They're teaching.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.540]   >> From Search CI--
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.060]   >> That's Kevin Gisneld.
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.060]   That's another thing.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.060]   Kevin's right.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:31.820]   There-- in fact, there was a list-- ACM just put out a list which is on the devorect.org/blog
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.020]   to put in ACM, you'll find it.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:42.220]   Anyway, there was a list of the worst jobs not to take, including coding in C is considered
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.980]   a dead end.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.820]   And the languages do need to change.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.780]   And if you talk to a lot of people in some of these schools and you find out what they've
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.780]   been taught-- because I get a lot of letters.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.900]   You know what they're trying to teach us?
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.900]   >> Cobalt.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.340]   >> Yeah, well, Cobalt's number one on the list, by the way.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:00.100]   But you know, Pascal and some of these dead languages that--
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.700]   >> But I think it varies a lot with this school because all the guys I know that came out
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.140]   of the university of Arizona in the last five years-- I know a bunch of guys who went
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.300]   to school there, they're in UCLA.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.900]   They're basically all programming Java.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.300]   You know, that was like the language that they were all brought up on.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.380]   That's how they're all making a living.
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.380]   And they're all making a pretty good living at it.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.460]   >> I don't know if that's the language of the future, though.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.900]   >> Well, yeah, but you know, how many languages of the future have there been in the last
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:25.900]   decade?
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.900]   >> Yeah, true.
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.700]   >> So I need somebody to help me with some PHP code.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.700]   Oh, I just-- did I say that?
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.700]   And also some--
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.700]   >> And some Pearl.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.700]   >> I don't need Pearl.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.700]   >> Some CSS.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.700]   >> Some CSS.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.700]   >> He's doing Drupal.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:39.700]   >> I will see it.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.700]   Yeah, doing Drupal.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.300]   I'm going to do some of the speeches from the Webby Awards.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.100]   You know, you only get five words.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.300]   And some of them are pretty good.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:52.300]   But first, another greeting for our 100th episode.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   Somewhere in here.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.700]   >> This is David Capitol from Wisconsin, Stevens.90 FM, the only alternative, home
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.380]   of the world's largest trivia contest.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:05.020]   Happy anniversary to all you Twitters out there, and especially to the Tech News Masters known
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.300]   as the Twit Gang.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   >> He's not a disc jockey.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.500]   Let's try another one.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.500]   Hi, this is Rob.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   Hi, this is Craig.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.100]   >> Hi, this is Adam.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.700]   >> And from all of us at the Pawnch Stevenson Show podcast.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.660]   >> That's Stevenson.com.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.700]   >> We'd like to say congratulations to Leo Laport and the cast of Twit.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.500]   >> Twit.tv.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.580]   >> For 100 entertaining episodes.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.300]   And now we will spend 10 seconds summing up the last 50 episodes.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.100]   And if we're on our act at org slash blog, the Zoom is cool.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.300]   Oh, wait.
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.300]   It's not--
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.900]   >> The RIAA is evil.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.500]   >> 09F9, 1102, 9D74.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.700]   What does it mean?
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.500]   >> It's a cookbook.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.500]   >> Yes.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.700]   Twit is great.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.300]   And we hope you stick around for another 100 episodes.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.100]   >> I got a little de Vorek going with that kid there.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.300]   >> I don't know what the deals are there.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.300]   How old is that?
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.300]   >> I don't know.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.300]   I don't know.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.300]   I don't know the Pawnch podcast.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.100]   I don't have to listen to it now.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.300]   Webby Awards.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.300]   Did you read some--
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.300]   I think this is the one--
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.900]   The Webbies are outside of control.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.500]   They have like 800 award winners.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.900]   But they still have five words for the thank you speech.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.900]   And I think that really is great.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.700]   It just gets people creative.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.700]   Meg Whitman, winning for lifetime achievement.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.700]   She's the CEO of eBay.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.700]   Earth thank you.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.700]   Bidding starts at 99 cents.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.700]   >> That's awesome.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.700]   >> Beastie Boyz.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.300]   Can anyone fix my computer?
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.500]   David Bowie didn't--
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.700]   He was unable to do.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.100]   Because I only get five words.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.100]   Shoot, that was five.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.100]   But four more there.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.100]   Oh, that's three.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.100]   Oh, two.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.100]   And then they pull him off.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.500]   It's Facebook.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.100]   I'm just here for Bowie.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.500]   There's one actually a serious one from CNET.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.900]   They won People's Voice for Guides, Ratings, Reviews.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.300]   And I like their thank you.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.100]   This one's for James Kim.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.900]   Of course, work for CNET.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.900]   And it's a good friend of all of ours.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.900]   So that's nice.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.100]   >> Got in there, yeah.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.500]   The Reggie Bush Project is one for sports.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.700]   Finally, a bush everyone loves.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.620]   Man, just to United official website.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.620]   He gave you David Beckham.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:22.100]   Sony.com, the focus groups were right.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.900]   I think this is a great idea.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.500]   We'd have to--
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   Some of them are--
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.900]   >> He got me cracking up.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.900]   >> Oh, you're laughing.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.900]   I hear it.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.100]   And you're laughing silently.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.100]   Inside.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.100]   Deep.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.100]   >> I don't know.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.700]   I'm Grand Hotel Encicino, which one for corporate communications.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.900]   Undiscover your inner Vegas.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.820]   >> Current TV, Al Gore's TV Channel.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.220]   Which by the way, I'm told, is very successful.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.780]   Much more so than we were.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.780]   Did you know that?
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.300]   >> You know, I've never seen it.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.940]   >> It's in 50 million homes, 5-0.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.940]   More than we ever were.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:59.100]   It was the fastest growth to 50 in the history of cable television.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.380]   >> Yeah, but what's our audience?
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.940]   I mean, the number of homes is a bogus number.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.940]   >> Well, I agree.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.940]   I don't think they're not used to it.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:06.940]   >> I mean, here's Al Gore.
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:11.260]   He's got-- he's hooked up with a deeply in the political system.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.740]   And he goes around as the kind of the pitchman for this thing.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.540]   And what cable company's going to say no to him because then he won if him could have
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.540]   some horrible thing happen to him based on some government edict.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.540]   So they all sign up.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.780]   So they got 50 million homes.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.780]   Okay, well, that worked.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.780]   That was a pretty good deal.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.780]   But who's listening?
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.780]   I mean, who's watching?
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.780]   I don't know.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.500]   I've seen a little bit of it.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   And I haven't watched it since.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.900]   >> It's cheap because all of the content is created by viewers, right?
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.100]   >> Yeah, but the problem is that what they're trying to do is they basically say, okay,
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.820]   if you have good content, if you're a filmmaker or you have a camera and you're shooting something
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.540]   interesting, come to our website, upload the video.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:58.260]   The community will then get around that video, vote on the best, and they'll display the
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.260]   top videos on their television network.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:06.300]   Now, the problem though is that the users, the people that are shooting this content,
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.620]   they don't need current.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.180]   They can just go to YouTube, upload it, and get 10 times the amount of viewers.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.180]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.180]   >> But can they get paid?
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.820]   >> Well, there's a five-o-box.
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.020]   So eventually, yeah, they go to Revver then and you'll make money.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.460]   >> Yeah, Revver pays you.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.940]   There's a bunch of them that do.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.260]   I think that's the next model.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.820]   >> You know, I didn't realize until I read an article in the, I think it was the Times
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:34.980]   that we all saw the Will Ferrell short, The Landlord, where the little kid is berating
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.980]   him.
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.980]   It's pretty funny.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.980]   >> That was funny.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.220]   >> Go, baby, I bet.
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.580]   >> And it was on a site, Funny or Die, and you know, I remember, you know, I linked it
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.060]   on my Tom Along and so forth, and I remember it had a little bug, Funny or Die.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:52.620]   I didn't realize this, but he was giving a ton of money from Venture Capital to create
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.700]   this site as another YouTube, except that comics would go there and use it.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.980]   Are they wasting their money?
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.460]   Is it throwing away their money?
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.100]   >> Maybe they just wanted to meet him.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.580]   >> Who, I can't remember the name of the investor.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.660]   You know, it's one of these Sandhill Road types, but they gave them a lot of money.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.660]   >> How much is a lot?
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.540]   >> I mean, 20, 30, 40 million?
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:19.340]   I mean, you're all trying to find the article, but I was kind of surprised.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.620]   I mean, I didn't even know that, I mean, I remember, I watched the thing, but I don't
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.780]   remember that, you know, spending a lot of time on the site or it wasn't even clear that
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.540]   this is Will Ferrell's new comedy site.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:35.380]   >> I think he gets that per movie nowadays.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.460]   >> Sequoia that gave him the money.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:46.060]   Mark Fami, who actually was part of the early tech TV way back when?
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.660]   >> We all know Mark.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:48.660]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:49.660]   >> I'm a director.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.180]   >> With Adam McKay, who is a Will Ferrell's partner.
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.660]   I see if I can find him.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.660]   >> Was it 20 million?
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.660]   >> I'll meet you.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.660]   See if I can find him.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.340]   >> Seems like a waste of money.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:02.900]   >> It doesn't seem like a sensible investment, to be honest with you.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:08.140]   >> I don't know, I'm still on the current TV website checking out Puppy Scams.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:13.180]   I mean, they're looking for another, I mean, they made half a billion on YouTube.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.580]   They're looking for another.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.580]   Right.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.820]   >> There's so many of these video sites now.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.220]   >> Ah, da da da da da da da.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.300]   See, Juiced got 45 million from Sequoia.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.420]   Sequoia is just funny or die.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.340]   I'm trying to find a- >> Got a track record that guy.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.340]   >> Which guy?
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.340]   >> Juiced.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.340]   >> Juiced, the great record.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.540]   >> Yeah, I give them money.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.540]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:42.180]   >> I don't- >> Much for Juiced, but I admire them.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.820]   The guy's- >> Juiced is cool.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.140]   >> Yeah, they've got the sign the right deals and they also, they're talking about integration
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.180]   to the Apple TV and a bunch of other set-top box devices.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.860]   >> Oh, now that would be good.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:55.980]   Is the Apple TV a flop?
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.980]   I even saw rumors- >> It's a hobby.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:58.980]   >> Yeah, it's a hobby.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.980]   >> Yeah, it's a hobby.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.980]   >> That's a job set.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.980]   >> An expensive hobby.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   >> That's what he said.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.980]   >> It's a hobby.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:08.180]   >> I think it's a, you know, it's one of the products that I think is the right idea at
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.060]   the wrong time and I think that the gut, as long as they don't pull the plug on it and
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.300]   they keep their foot in the door, when IPTV comes along, I think this thing could be important.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.420]   I like the Apple TV.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.420]   >> I love it.
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.420]   I'm using mine all the time.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.700]   >> I think it's the right idea at the wrong price point.
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.220]   >> Well, that's the correct- >> Well, of course, I don't use-
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.220]   >> What's the- >> What's the-
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.220]   >> What's the- >> What's the-
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.220]   >> What's the- >> $29.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.220]   >> Wow.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.220]   >> It's 250, that's insane.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.220]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.220]   >> That's like an X30.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.220]   >> It's 299, actually.
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.220]   >> It's 300.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.220]   >> Yeah, 99 bucks, you know.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:39.020]   >> The biggest problem is you can't buy high-def content on iTunes, so I mean, if you're really
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.260]   going to use it, the way you use it is by stealing stuff, and that's basically the,
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.060]   you know, almost that's what I do.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.580]   >> Well, you can hack it.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.780]   We just released a system on revision three on how to hack the-
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.580]   >> Ryan's very hackable.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.140]   >> But you don't need to hack it.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.420]   >> It takes a fair amount of effort to hack it, and there are some actually good reasons
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.940]   to hack it, like the ability to set it up, so RSS feeds will show up on your monitor.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.580]   I was actually at that episode.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.580]   >> Oh, that's right.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.580]   You're the one that did it.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.580]   >> Yeah.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.020]   >> Expanding the hard drive capacity for all the storage.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.020]   >> You forgot.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.180]   >> But I mean, it's funny, but there's also this is- it's a very clean design, but it's
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:19.460]   like, you know, seven other devices that have been out as media center extenders for a
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.460]   while.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.460]   You know, it's the right idea.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:26.420]   It's a question as to how long before the sort of a standardized, easy-to-access IPTV
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.220]   format, you know, which is what John was saying.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:32.860]   >> So, you know, to move in that direction with the MIF TV folks, trying to create a
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.180]   standardized platform, a reference platform for-
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.620]   >> Well, there's like MIF TV and democracy and, you know, and then-
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.620]   >> Democracy is cool.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.180]   >> Yeah, everybody wants to do something like that.
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.860]   Hey, I want to thank the folks at Audible.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:50.660]   They're back, by the way, on the show and-
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.980]   >> Oh, after you complained bitterly last week, you think that had anything to do with
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:54.980]   it?
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:55.980]   >> It had nothing to do with it.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.980]   You know what it had to do with?
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:57.980]   It was a very successful campaign.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.300]   We did one commercial and they got quite a few.
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.300]   They had something like 6,000 people at the website.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.980]   >> So you're telling me that the complaining didn't help?
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.140]   >> Did I complain about Audible?
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:12.660]   >> Do you remember last week I was talking about the confessions of an economic hit man
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.620]   and it was on the tape that you could get from.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.220]   So it said not to mention them.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.740]   >> Oh, I was just because they didn't pay for that particularly.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.620]   But they're back, so they're paying for this one.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.820]   Actually, what we're going to do, and I think this is going to be fun and we're going to
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:27.900]   do it on a number of the other Twitter podcasts as well, is pick a book, each show that's
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.180]   available on Audible.com.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.300]   My confessions of an economic hit man, which by the way I got a lot of email from people
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.740]   saying they downloaded it and we're listening and loved it.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.580]   And that book is free.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.740]   Actually any book is free.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.660]   No strings attached.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:43.420]   If you want to sample Audible, this is a great way to do it.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.620]   So going forward, if you guys have an Audible book that you'd like or a book that you liked
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.940]   that is on Audible.com that you think people should listen to, just let me know.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.460]   The one I'm picking this week is one I'm listening to right now, which I'm loving, is
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.220]   Jeff Hawkins' new book on intelligence.
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.820]   So if you guys know Jeff, he's the guy who founded Palm.
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.700]   Yeah, he won't take our calls anymore.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.260]   I'm doing an interview with him.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.700]   Tell him I said hi.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:12.180]   Well, you know how I did it because Donna Dubinsky, who was his partner at Palm and also at Handspring,
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.180]   is my classmate.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.180]   And I was at the reunion, right?
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.180]   She was my classmate at Yale.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.180]   And so she was at the reunion.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.220]   So I said, Donna, I'd like to get him on Twitter.
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.340]   And she said, no problem.
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.180]   So I'll set him up with you.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.260]   Anyway, he's written a really interesting book.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:29.220]   I didn't know this, but all along while he was doing the Palm and his new thing, the folio
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.220]   and the trio.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.500]   The folio is really interesting, by the way.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.580]   I think folio is going to be a hit.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.180]   I'm really liking it.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.340]   500 bucks, it runs Linux.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.940]   When I thought, at first I thought, oh, it's Palm, who cares, but it runs Linux, which
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.940]   I think is interesting.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.940]   Anyway, we'll talk about the folio.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.180]   Yeah, the price is tough.
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.540]   500 is a little high, but you know, it's, I mean, how much is the Apple iPhone?
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.180]   600, five or 600.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.300]   Oh, but that's okay.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.300]   Hey, I didn't say that.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.300]   Who said that?
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.300]   Did anybody say that's okay?
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.300]   It's nothing.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.460]   I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, just because Kevin's going to buy one doesn't mean he likes
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.460]   the price.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.460]   It's true.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:10.100]   Jeff, Jeff is, Jeff has studied from day one neuroscience in the brain and actually has
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.300]   a very interesting model of how the brain works.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.740]   And the reason I'm going to interview him, he started a company called Numenta that is
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.060]   designed around putting this to work.
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.140]   I mean, he's, I put his money where his mouth is saying, look, I think we can, this is a
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.540]   new form of computer intelligence.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.260]   Anyway, the book is fascinating.
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.260]   It's called on intelligence.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.260]   He's, I know the, for a fact that he's, but he's been like this character with his
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.260]   whole life.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.260]   Yeah, forever.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.260]   I just, just nice.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.540]   I said, you know, but I'll get that one.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.540]   So that's free.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.540]   Now what would you do?
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.540]   You go to audible.com/twit.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:41.060]   Yes, you would, John.
