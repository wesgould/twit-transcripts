[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.580]   2003 holy cow
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.980]   Can't be that long ago. I think I was no maybe maybe not quite that long ago
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.780]   I wasn't far out of college
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.420]   I mean it was one that we were within the first hundred episodes of Twi how many how many companies ago was it?
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.420]   That might be easier for you
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.800]   Yeah, a few a few different companies a couple of different startups and many many late nights
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.460]   Sleeping over
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.460]   Slaving over documents. So last time you're here. You were telling us about your company entail
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.460]   Which you had just started the nta le
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.860]   Dot com what's a really cool idea in rich podcast?
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.380]   Content and I understand very cool podcast company. I see the lower 30s changed that you have been acquired
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:43.060]   Yes, so we DMG media which owns a lot of great titles including as you might see on the lower third
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.100]   The new scientists acquired the company and actually as part of the as part of what we've been working on for the last few months
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.580]   We just revamped the new scientist podcast. So go and check out the new the new new scientist weekly podcast
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.300]   Which is a fantastic listen. I'm a big fan. Well if you like this show, yeah, we talk about new scientists articles all the time
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.060]   So that's great. I mean, I'm definitely not not a non-on-air talent for that one
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.260]   Well, I was gonna ask you a little bit behind the scene the latest research on quantum computing, but okay, we'll save that
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.420]   Yeah, no sadly putt pass me over for the
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:26.020]   Rats cuz I there's no one I can ask about this and I see that nuclear fusions back in the news. We'll get to that in a bit
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.060]   Oh, it's it's big baby. It's huge. It's huge. It's just gonna be it's gonna be a life changer
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.620]   Also with us Wesley Faulkner who has the same job two shows in a row had a community
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.860]   No, I'm thrilled to have you as always head of community at single store single store calm good to see how's things going?
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.020]   Thanks, it's a challenging week. So that almost didn't happen. So glad we were able to yeah, how close are you to Kenosha?
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.740]   Four hours, okay, that's far enough away. You probably didn't hear the
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.540]   Screams of rage does something happen there nothing zero, okay zero. We're not gonna talk about it. That's all I have to say
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.220]   Yeah, actually did you did you get a new hairdo am I wrong?
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.340]   Okay, so I had dreads. I shaved off a year ago
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.020]   and then I had a closer shave and then
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.420]   My partner said that it was too short
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.100]   Incredibly short and so I'm growing it back out. Are you gonna have a throw or you gonna have a full fro?
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.240]   I love the idea of uncomfortably short where's like
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.300]   This guy with his uncomfortably short British air
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.180]   Apparently I have a misshapen
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.540]   Oh, I would love to be able to have more hair. Honestly, I'm holding on to what I've got for dear life
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.620]   Lisa I shaved my head as you may remember for unisef some years ago
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.780]   Lisa said you may never do that again. I too have an oddly shaped skull
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.420]   So I'm under the same contract
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.940]   Actually, I think it looks good, but I mean how big are you gonna go? I mean are you gonna go you could well see only time was awesome
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.180]   That's awesome. It looks good now. It's this a good good legs. I think yeah, not that it's
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.340]   I've conditioner answers nice and shiny. Yeah, it's good. No
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.980]   I'm talking about hair. I'm so embarrassed. Let's move on
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.740]   We also have a brand new but very welcome
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.500]   Contributor on the show. He's kind of legendary Chris Brimesberger is here. Well editor
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.820]   Well editor emeritus at e-week. How long were you at e-week?
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:33.580]   Well, oh five to twenty one so sixteen years do the math and by the way, I've never shaved my head by the way
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.620]   I never will so I just won't let you know good. I
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.540]   Do not recommend it
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.960]   It was cold it was cold I bet
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.220]   Contributing writer and editor at zd net he is also I've just learned
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.660]   One of the voices of Stanford football and he's a little groggy after the big game last night
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.060]   Yeah, well fortunately the game was at four but I didn't get home until nine or ten
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.300]   I guess it was and then I had to get up early this morning
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:06.700]   But no, I've worked in the Stanford press box for over four decades. Oh, that's a long time. They call it the big game
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.800]   Yeah, unfortunately the axe was handed over I believe
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.020]   Stanford was axed by forty forty one to eleven
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:22.140]   But you know for Stanford fans that Cal fans it was a it was a joy in fact
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.740]   I think there were more Cal fans at the game last night than Stanford really it looked it looked like it
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.820]   Yeah, by the colors by the colors. Yep. Those guys in blue and gold are very loud as well
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:37.660]   Yes, they are very loud. It was it was fun, but yeah, yeah
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:44.420]   I've worked I came to northern, California and in 79 as an assistant sports information director Stanford
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.760]   Oh, really and so that was the job that brought me up from LA where I was a sport rider
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.860]   so
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.180]   I've connected with Stanford ever since and it's been fun because I you know
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.340]   I enjoy going to the games and getting to know the players and the coaches
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.780]   So it's ironic because I've always thought that tech news and tech coverage is very similar to sports
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:07.700]   In that you're covering something that people care passionately about that probably you know, it's there's no deaths
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:13.300]   There's no helicopter crashes. It's kind of the toy store, but so it's fun to cover
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:19.060]   But then the irony of it is that people who are in a tech very care very little usually about sport ball
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.780]   And I imagine it goes the other way the other way as well
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:29.240]   There's also a huge amount of like partisanship and a team base cheering right you're either team apple or team
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.240]   That's right and screw those other guys. That's right. You know, you got that
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.240]   I think we have a story about a
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.740]   New Colosseum that has a new name that may
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.860]   Put a little chink in your throat. No, it combines the two of cool
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.220]   They renamed staple center, which has been the stapler center
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.820]   Staple centers as long as it's been around it's a beautiful 99
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:56.380]   And it's where the it's where the Clippers play and the Lakers play and it's kind of famous because it's a big TV market
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:03.460]   Every nose and the hockey Kings to the Kings the staple center. It is now the crypto dot-com arena
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.140]   What it seems kind of where it seems kind of appropriate so the meteor is taken to
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.300]   To shawding it and shawding it and calling it the crypt because that's when
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:21.100]   That was a natural talk about it. I don't tell you buried buried very badly. Oh
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:28.620]   That's that's that was a natural that was gonna happen no matter what so the crypto dot-com
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.660]   I guess is one of the crypto companies that is is doing quite well. I don't even
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.180]   I honestly they're all blended together to me
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:45.500]   Yeah, that was that cost 700 million dollars 20 years for 20 years did they pay a lot of money coin because it's not so much
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:54.340]   Maybe Bitcoin hit 70,000 a couple of weeks ago. Maybe maybe they just gave him a thousand Bitcoin and call it a day
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:10:00.660]   Maybe they just put up their domain name for auction because that'll probably fetch that much did you okay speaking a Bitcoin
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.380]   They tried the Bitcoin bros tried to buy the US Constitution, but failed
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.980]   That's a link baby kind of a headline
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:15.540]   Accurate there right well turns out that there are
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:21.340]   18 13 copies printed copies of the US Constitution not handwritten
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:26.860]   But printed copies of the Constitution and sauthabees auctioned one of them off
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.540]   yesterday and seeing that this was coming a
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:37.500]   Bunch of crypto investors put together a Dow
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   which stands for this is this is a acronym for something that's equally meaningless a
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.180]   decentralized autonomous organization and
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:53.940]   The Dow raised 40 million in crypto 40 million dollars in crypto
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.540]   More than 2,000 people contributed an average of 200 bucks each 40 million dollars
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.020]   But it turned out not to be enough. They were gonna buy the Constitution
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.220]   I don't know what they were gonna do tear it up into 2,000 pieces. I had no idea
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.700]   How how would you get what would you get?
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.300]   So the idea so I think the idea was they were going to
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:19.300]   Donate it to a museum along but on the condition that it was displayed
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:28.260]   With an explanation of what a DAO was oh Lord and why it was going to be sort of like the future of currency and the
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.860]   interesting
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:36.400]   Wrinkle in this in in the stories not only did they get out bid for it by six or seven million dollars
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.260]   But it is estimated that as much
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:46.060]   Possibly as 15 million dollars of the 40 million that was raised went on ethereum gas fees
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:54.860]   And so actually they would have needed to raise more like 60 to actually bid the 50 that it would have cost them to get
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.820]   And so it's the great irony of like this is the future of you know the future of money
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.860]   But unfortunately it cost us sort of 15 million to raise 40 that still wasn't enough
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.620]   So they were I said Bitcoin it was they were raising ethereum
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:14.940]   Here's the sad so a bit and by the way it was of course a hedge fund billionaire that outbid them who else
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:21.460]   This is this is it feels like that's a huge story. You're kind of like skipping over the whole back story here
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:30.100]   Oh, please the front person for this Dow was the same guy who was doing the meme stocks of
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:35.100]   For mr. Diamond hands himself game
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.020]   GameStop and AMC and run those up and he put together the Dow and
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.780]   the person that actually bought the Constitution was
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.660]   the person who advised Robin Hood about cutting off
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.620]   Limiting the the amount of trades on those doff
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.820]   He's the CEO Citadel which was the hedge fund that fun that gave Robin Hood a bunch of money
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:07.300]   Exactly so like that it was almost like a revenge play like oh, you're wow is the ultimate revenge on the game even want the Constitution
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:13.380]   He doesn't care about the Constitution. He's a stick into mr. Stonk
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.100]   Yes, yes
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:22.100]   This is a mini series waiting for Netflix to buy it. It's just an amazing story
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:28.520]   So this got very personal very fast. Clearly. Yeah. Wow. Wow
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:35.860]   He must he knew who he's bidding against obviously and bid it up and he was gonna beat him no matter what obviously no matter what he's
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:42.460]   the fourth wealthiest hedge fund manager with a net worth of 16 billion so
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:49.760]   He's got it's also very apropos about how billionaires are buying democracy. I mean, yeah, there's a little kind of perfect
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:56.980]   This is kind of the what were on the Constitution one of those things where where subtext becomes just text
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:02.380]   a little too obvious for HBO I think they're gonna have to modify
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.140]   Constitution DAO calm
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:11.700]   the or we did not win the bid for the copy of the US Constitution
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:20.220]   While this wasn't the outcome we hoped for we still made history tonight the largest crowd fund for a physical object that we are aware of
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.100]   Yeah
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:27.660]   40 million minus gas fees. I didn't realize gas fees were that high on any theory. That's yeah
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.660]   there should be a
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:35.820]   Yeah, and the prime is of like car drivers on one side and then NFT traders in the other in the middle says the gas is
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.020]   To be a gas fee. That's who made money on this
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.500]   I mean also, it's generally not a good idea to go into an auction announcing what your maximum bid is
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.700]   Yeah, like everyone knew they'd raise like 40 million
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.020]   I well then I just bid 40 and a half and you're away in a way
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:57.140]   It just shows how dumb Ken Griffin was because he bid 43.2 million. He should have just 40 and a penny
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.060]   gonna one
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:06.100]   Maybe somebody else got involved. I don't know I got the numbers wrong. They said 17,437 donors
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.900]   median donation 206 dollars well
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:18.940]   Ethereum equivalent you will get a refund of your pro rat amount effectively minus gas fees through jukes juice box
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.940]   They said so
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.940]   There you go
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:28.820]   There have been other dows right this is not a new cons. It's not the first time we've seen a DAO
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.860]   No, and there's a lot of a lot of excitement in the
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:40.740]   In the investor community about the fact that this the DAOs might really do something to to break up the sort of hold on
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:46.140]   The hold on to the startup industry that venture capitalists have because if you can make it
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.740]   Easy enough to effectively crowd fund money
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:55.620]   But with a specific purpose so the people that are putting in the money know they're not gonna get sort of
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.380]   screwed over later and
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.780]   That you know, they kind of know what they're signing up for in advance
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.700]   That it could actually Jason Calicana's has been talking a lot on Twitter about the fact that
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.860]   DAOs could could be a real game changer for startups going forward
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.500]   So everybody caught on the NFTs and so they had a new acronym just in case
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.100]   Wait, I mean, that's not keep think let's not make things simple for everybody
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.900]   I mean there was a there was a you know, the one of the sort of
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:31.660]   Sort of key things about the entire NFT in crypto spaces is is the acronym of dyor
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:37.700]   For do your own research and it's like yes, nothing says mainstream adoption like spend hours online
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.860]   In order to well and let's be fair
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.740]   There's a lot of people claiming they're doing their own research and coming up with kind of kooky
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.100]   No, so doing your own really well for that
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:59.180]   I did the research and I think horse do you weremer. That's the solution so
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.100]   Some are saying that actually are we officially saying that DAOs are the horse D
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:13.980]   The hosty warmer of cyber currencies. Yes, I don't know that you couldn't actually effectively say that Bitcoin itself was a DAO
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:22.340]   DAOs according to Wikipedia our organizations represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:30.780]   blockchain controlled by the organization members Satoshi and not influenced by a central government, right?
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.780]   And sipped El Salvador
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:40.300]   So in a way, I guess Bitcoin is a DAO so DAO is closer to like the co-op grocery store
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.940]   Right, right go there you buy stuff
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:51.060]   But you also are a member and so when stuff comes up for bid you have like you can vote for it and saying we should adopt this rule or
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.900]   Have your favorite soaps brought in whatever
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:59.060]   So it's kind of like that your part owner and your operator and if the
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.180]   Venture itself is profitable. You get a little bit of a cut
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:07.980]   It's kind of easy Chris for us old timers to kind of mock
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.980]   The things these young people come up with
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.860]   So I don't really I don't I want to
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.660]   recuse myself
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:21.820]   I mean, maybe there's a there's could be some real interesting benefits to DAOs. I don't know
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.740]   Just give it some time. I remember Palo Alto had a had a
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.900]   co-op market for a long time it was very popular and I wonder how that worked
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:39.820]   Oh, yeah, we I used to be a member you'd have to go and you know restock the bulk bins and put more vinegar in the giant
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:45.540]   Vinegar tub and stuff like that and you'd be part of the co-op you put in some sweat equity and then you could buy your
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:52.540]   Your old vegetables there and yeah, it was that was the back in the day, right? Yeah, that was a while ago
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.980]   Yeah, no more no more now. We got dows
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.900]   dows
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:03.140]   For instance you can you now if you really want to make things exciting you can use a doubt to buy an NFT
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:10.260]   Should we call it a NIFT if I'm gonna call it a Dow I should call it a NIFT in May 2021
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.860]   Jenny Dow bought an original song from Steve Ioki
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.780]   as an NFT hmm
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.740]   People are listening this in like what language
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:29.220]   Like yeah, I hit the level of like record setting TLDR's not TLDR's
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.780]   Yeah
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.780]   I
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:42.180]   Bust up acronyms and I'm writing I explain them all the time because a lot of people don't understand
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.740]   Yeah, but does it explain it if I say to you all you mean a decentralized autonomous organization?
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.300]   What the hell does that mean? Well?
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:56.220]   It's at least two sentences every time you say Dow it's at least two sentences. Maybe that's that's true
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.940]   Yeah, the change is using our makeup names now
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:04.860]   It's not the Dow that most people think of when you think of finance
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:10.220]   Institutions not that not the D O D O W Dow not the Dow
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.420]   Immediately break that up as well. Oh, I love the fact that that just to be mischievous
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:21.740]   Because there's a you know, obviously NFT's, you know one of a kind on a blockchain, etc
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:26.860]   Somebody made the version of the pirate bay for NFT's this week
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:33.380]   Just basically right clicking everybody's like really expensive for day profile pictures and uploading
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.700]   Oh, yes, and it's gigabytes, right?
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.500]   I'm here. Yeah, yeah, so that's it
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.940]   You know, but that underscores the fact that when you buy an NFT you're not
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.940]   You're not taking something, you know the Mona Lisa putting in a box
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:54.660]   Digital copies of your NFT float around perfect copies of a float around you don't control that
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.660]   Yeah, you're buying the ownership. You're not buying the thing you can say say
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:03.580]   That's he that's see bit that's high-resombe. I own that
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:11.820]   It's it sucks because you don't even have the rights to it as well because like when Jack put us his first tweet as an NFT
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.840]   Right, and you sold it. Yeah, you can't say okay. No one else can use this no
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:21.100]   Or or you gotta give me a big like if you're like I have my copyright because I own this
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.900]   So now you have to pay me to quote this they don't you can't even do that
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.500]   You can just say like look at this tweet that everyone has seen everywhere
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.140]   So they actually call it the NFT bay, which is a circle
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.540]   it's an Australian artist as well as programmer and
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:44.060]   You can go there and download every NFT on the Ethereum blockchain with one click of the mouse
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:49.260]   But be prepared it's 15 terabytes
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:54.760]   Oh, but does it also find single housewives near me as I'm downloading
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.580]   It's be a why not be a just let you
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.620]   Just if you love it put a ring on it, that's all I'm saying
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.780]   Just it's it's just the modern world
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.340]   You get to a point in your life
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:19.460]   Where you realize why your grandfather and your father and all these old folks were saying get off of my lawn
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.180]   That there's just there's just comes a time in your life where you go
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:29.980]   You young people stop playing that rock and roll so loud, you know and cut your hair Wesley cut your hair
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.220]   Yeah, I just raised my hand said I'm done. I'm done. I don't I'm over. I'm one. I don't get it
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.740]   I don't know. I don't understand anyway. It's welcome to the crypto comm
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.580]   arena in
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:47.460]   Los Angeles. I want to hear announcers explaining that when they do the Lakers games. We're here at the crypto
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.460]   Do they say crypto comm or just crypto?
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.820]   Probably crypto crypto crypto. I think you have to say that don't call the thing
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.980]   $700 million. Yep 20 years holy moly
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.420]   Yeah, let's go around a while. I still think crypto comm is gonna be here in 20
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:14.860]   But on the other hand, you know, we can mock it but like the whole place was previously named after like a staple
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.680]   Staple is a store. It was a store. It's an office
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.540]   Yeah, but staples is only named staples because there's a whole state table, right?
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:30.660]   It's like a printer paper. A good point if you really think about it. It's not you know, it's not like exactly an iconic name
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.020]   neither is the the
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.020]   Peco arena, right?
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:39.700]   Peco Park and and Minute made Park in Houston. There's another one
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.420]   unbelievable
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:50.820]   There's one in one in Atlanta. I think it's called truest. I think they're baseball park is called truest
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.700]   That's a bank, but a lot of people don't realize what truest t. Are you ist?
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.860]   Well, well, I mean it should have been Gerber with all the dribbling. I mean it would
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:07.820]   Espy nation has a list of 15 13 dumb arena names
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.900]   Inspired by the crypto comm arena
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.500]   And I think it's just a matter of time before we have the tiktok arena
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.100]   The Jake and Logan Paul
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.780]   Brothers stadium
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.340]   Instagram influencer dome
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.140]   Well, hey, we already have to twit brick house. So
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:32.660]   The dogecoin stadium
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:39.420]   Q stadium the Mark Zuckerberg sports adjacent metaverse athletic complex
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.860]   Turmeric bone broth dome
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.260]   Elon Musk dome
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.580]   Okay, we'll stop there. I don't want to finish that list, but
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:57.620]   Thank you Espy nation for letting me steal your very fine
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.380]   humor
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.100]   I didn't play plan to start with that, but it's it's actually a great story
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:08.200]   El Salvador is about to create a Bitcoin city of course remember El Salvador
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:15.620]   Actually made Bitcoin their national currency a few months ago. They're issuing a tokenized bond
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.620]   Developed by block stream to be processed by bit fine X
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:26.940]   500 million dollars of a planned billion dollar bond offering to buy more crypto
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:33.900]   In El Salvador Bitcoin city will be located along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano. Why not?
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.940]   It's affordable
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:42.620]   Go wrong. Okay. They may actually plan on putting a power plant by the volcano
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.620]   to provide energy for the city and Bitcoin mining so
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.900]   That's the idea right free energy as the lava flows a
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.100]   residential commercial areas restaurants and airport
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:59.100]   Port in rail city it will be laid out in a circle looking like a coin
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.420]   Which is ironic because there isn't no coin in Bitcoin and in the city center. There'll be a plaza
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.900]   There'll be host to a giant Bitcoin symbol
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.180]   But you might want to move there because the city will have no income no property
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.660]   capital gains or payroll taxes
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.900]   income property capital gains or payroll taxes no taxes
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.500]   They didn't mention sales tax
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.020]   hmm and
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.980]   How do they fix the roads the circular roads the magical Bitcoin?
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:34.820]   That's it. Yeah, how can bit how can Bitcoin become a national currency? That's what I want to know
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:41.220]   The mayor of New York City has announced that he's going to take his first three pay paychecks in Bitcoin
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.620]   but that's only because
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.140]   The mayor of Miami says we're gonna have our own coin
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:53.420]   Miami coin and so the new mayor of New York says well, we're gonna have New York coin. It's just it's
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.260]   it's
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:01.100]   I thought crypto currencies are not supposed to be attached to any national current. Oh, they can be though. They can be
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:08.020]   But there's the point of it being decentralized is that you can do if you want to because you're not changing the nature of the crypto
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.500]   You should you'll change in the nature of your own currencies relationship to it
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:20.180]   Hmm. Okay. You sound like you know about this stuff. Well, I think I think we need how have we not jumped on Twitch coin?
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.780]   There you go
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:30.820]   That's that's perfect itself. I like it. Can I pay for my coin is right behind you Leo's right up there
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:36.900]   It's gonna look exactly like this logo. Yeah, it's exactly it right there. That would be a pretty nice coin
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:42.200]   Pretty nice. I think you've got a brilliant idea. Let's take a little break. We're gonna come back with more

[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.440]   Well, you know what they show the characters they do something goofy and then they laugh and smile silently

[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:36.200]   Chris Prinsberger is also here. I love the title editor emeritus at e-week
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.680]   Oh, can I ask you a dumb question though?
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.000]   Done questions are accepted sure does e-week still exist?
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.360]   Yeah, it does and it does it's run by a company called technology advice in Nashville a small kind of an upcoming
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.480]   marketing publication publisher
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.200]   and
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.120]   James Maguire is now the editor. So is there a paper because I used to get the paper e-week
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.280]   Yeah, I did too. Yeah, we stopped in
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:12.360]   2011 and the reason I remember that is we we cut the physical magazine publishing
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:18.720]   The month after Steve Jobs died when I wrote his his obit for the cover and that's why I remember that
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:26.240]   October of 2011 you know e-week was one of a large category of magazines including PC week that were give you give me give me
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:32.800]   You they were free if you could show that you had you were you know an influencer at a big company like you bought
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:40.520]   technology because it was full of ads for those technologies and they were actually very good magazines PC week had Spencer the cat though, right?
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.960]   Right, and he kind of
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.860]   also kind of
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.200]   Bled over onto e-week for what no, that's that's not a good image, but he did
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:58.840]   He he kind of he kind of overlapped e-week also so Spencer F Spencer F cat remember it's Spencer F cat
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:05.560]   Yeah, he was the Whiskard Wonder the gossip columnist and there was always a question of who
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.280]   Spencer F cat was
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.120]   Do you know?
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.640]   Well, I I do and I
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:19.400]   Don't know if I I guess I could probably tell a little bit about it. You can you can finally tell the story
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.840]   Spencer had several
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:29.160]   personal identities at e-week used to come to I guess it was calm decks
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:35.000]   Back in those days there was a guy who would wear a Spencer cat costume. Yeah. Yeah
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.760]   Yeah, I should try to find a picture of Spencer so we can all find it for you go ahead
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:45.080]   You keep telling me the story so it was rotating assignment or just different people would take it
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:51.520]   I think different people would take it for a while and then it's like Robert X cringley was different people until it was finally one guy
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.160]   Yeah, yeah, exactly
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:31:02.360]   so yeah, I remember coming on and I think Eric one quest was doing it for a while and then John Pilata was doing it for a while and
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.280]   I did it for a while
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:11.800]   Ha ha ha I thought maybe you were a Spencer cat. It was fun. It was kind of fun
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.520]   I didn't do too many of them, but we did some I had I had some I had some suspicions
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:22.280]   Here's a cartoon. Oh, he still has a um, he has a Twitter account. Yeah
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.000]   So he's still writing it a week is he he's got yeah
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.280]   I think he's on high. I think he's on hiatus
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.120]   I mean the last last he was seen he was seen in the Caribbean and one of the islands there
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:42.440]   He's in Barbados now. He hasn't tweeted for four years. So I think we can safely say he is he is uh, he's passed on
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.080]   He may be surprised
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.560]   he
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.160]   May surprise somebody someday and come back circle. Did you ever get to wear the cat costume? No, no
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.560]   I never did never did that that's a bucket listing for me. Yeah
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.040]   Somebody's got it
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.200]   Raddy probably moldy in their basement somewhere. You don't throw that out
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:09.800]   Yeah, I will have to ask around some of the old timers like john dodge and some of the other
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:15.720]   Somebody's got it somewhere. Yeah, I'm trying to find my search for Spencer f cat
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.360]   calm decks
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.360]   Oh boy, I danced with him
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:27.320]   Uh at calm decks. Uh also bill gates was at that uh, that was a I think a pc mag party
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.800]   Wow. Yeah
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.600]   Yeah, well, there you go. You've learned more about uh
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:37.480]   Spencer f cat than you've probably ever thought you wanted to know
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:43.560]   Uh our show today brought to you by brand new sponsor, but somebody I've known for a long time
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.760]   No
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.320]   I remember it was about a almost a year ago. Lisa and I were
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:57.000]   We'd been watching tv a lot during the lockdown. I had gained the famous covet 19 pounds
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.480]   and uh
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.560]   I said lisa. I think we should do new
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:09.320]   And you know the thing is I did it got great results. I'm in theory still doing it lisa. You never stopped
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.000]   My wife lisa is our new model of the week
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.720]   You look so good
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.280]   Of course, I'm a little biased
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   How did noom do for you?
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.600]   Well, I wanted to make a lifestyle change in q1
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.800]   So I decided, you know, why not join noom with you. It was kind of a joint effort at first
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.600]   Well, I think I did it first and you I think said it initially. I'm gonna do it to support you
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.760]   I did I did because I also though gained a little weight
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:44.440]   Over covet and also going through menopause. It started to fluctuate a lot more and I really
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.840]   Wasn't happy with that. So noom had me at three things one. It's an app too
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.800]   If I heard easy one more time on tv
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:34:00.040]   I was like, okay. I really have to try this and the third thing that really grabbed me about noom was that a
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.200]   Candy maker was on it and he was successful and he was yeah
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.680]   And I have a sweet tooth so they had me at those three things and so I originally
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.840]   Started noom with you and in six weeks. I got to my goal weight
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.520]   And it was easy. I did not but okay. So the easy part
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:23.240]   Yeah, but the easy part was so beyond easy that I can't tell you it was just cake for me
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.840]   And then three months after that I went, you know what? I'm gonna go down five more pounds
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.560]   And I did in july I went down and I've been rocking my new goal weight sense and
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:37.160]   I won't go without noom. I mean the articles are amazing. You get a group coach
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.880]   You also have an individual coach
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.880]   It teaches you not to be afraid of the scale and here's the best news. Nothing's bad
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:51.640]   That's my favorite part. That's my favorite part too. My coach coach tia. I felt so guilty
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.200]   Uh because I had a hot dog
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.800]   And she and I said coach tia. I'm sorry. I had a hot dog. She said what's wrong with that?
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.040]   There are no bad foods
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.000]   And it's not a diet. I think that's the first thing to understand
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.280]   No, it's just about changing your lifestyle and adopting the pieces and learning
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.400]   What foods are better for you and things along those lines, but as a woman and as an American woman
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.600]   I want choices and so nothing is off the table with no
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:22.440]   They just teach you how to think about food to be more mindful about what you're doing
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.080]   And once you start actually applying a few of those
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.640]   Practices to your daily life
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.400]   It is the easiest thing i've ever adopted in a lifestyle change in 50 years knowledge is power
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.200]   And I think that's the thing for me that I love about noom
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:41.240]   Uh, it's an app you're it's on your phone. You record what you eat, but more importantly you get lessons
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.360]   They are using something called cognitive behavioral therapy
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:51.480]   Which is a big phrase that really just describes education learning you learning instead of setting rules
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:57.800]   Don't do that. That's bad. That's good. They they teach you a practical knowledge that lets you build
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.280]   I think a much more sustainable
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:05.000]   Relationship with food so that you don't feel guilty. You don't feel bad
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.720]   But you also understand when you're eating mindlessly
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.520]   When you're what what is it? What do they call that?
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.600]   There's a phrase that they use when you just kind of
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:19.960]   So there's fog eating they talk about all of the different types of ways that you're stuffing your face without thinking about it
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.440]   And they're just making you more aware that you're putting food into your body
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.240]   And they also teach you about processed foods and whole foods and what are better for you
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.800]   It literally changes your relationship with food it does
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.000]   And we're eating and I think that that's that's the thing that's lasting and that's why it's not a diet
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.880]   It's something that lasts your whole life. Correct
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:47.000]   And and you know and you know better about what you're eating but also you understand when you're fog eating or you're eating emotionally
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.200]   Um, it's really fun. It's very easy. The lessons are not long. No more than 15 minutes a day
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:59.000]   Uh, they're fun. They're jazzy and it really works and I think that's I think just look at lisa. Don't look at me
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.080]   I'm the before lisa is the the after 75 of new musers
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:11.720]   Finish the program more than 60 of users engaged with the program keep the weight off for a year or more
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.320]   You actually you're on what they call maintenance right now with no
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:21.080]   And you've kept not like kept the weight off, but you've you're you're absolutely in control of what's going on in fact when we were in
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.800]   Mexico you're logging what we're you're eating. I'm thinking
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.440]   Wow, I'm impressed
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:32.920]   Well, you can choose to keep logging or not, but I just have and it just keeps me accountable and mindful to myself
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:39.000]   And I don't think I will ever give this up because like I said, it's easy and it works for me. Yeah
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.960]   It's the knowledge and wisdom to let you build a better more sustainable relationship with eating and with your food better habits
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:52.520]   New weights cognitive behavioral approach helps you better understand your relationship with food how to be more mindful
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.280]   It gives you the knowledge and there's lots of support by the way, not only from your coach, but also from the group
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.400]   There's great group support for a long lasting change
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:09.640]   I've done every diet in the book and people long time listeners and viewers know i've talked about all the other things i've done
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:15.320]   Uh, there's never been anything it's one fun thing about a so-called diet is it stressful makes you eat more
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.960]   You know you go off the diet and you
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.480]   Shout down. This is not a diet. This is sustainable
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.400]   With noom taking care of your health is empowering not stress inducing
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:32.120]   There's no need to fear ruining the program with one off day. Everybody has off days. That's just that's part of the program
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.680]   Noom helps you get back on track. All you need is that daily 10 minute check-in

[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.800]   uh
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   Back to the news of the week
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:40.120]   Apple you know when the apple announced this on wednesday morning. I it was like news flash
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.920]   apple put out a press release
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.040]   Saying you can fix your own phone
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.040]   And we're going to give you the parts and the repair manuals
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:58.200]   This was like a complete reverse from apple apple's been fighting right to repair legislation in states many states
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.360]   with lobbyists with also any trick in the book
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.920]   um apple has for a long time
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.000]   Done things like
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.800]   Brick your phone if you do your own repairs most recently if you change the screen on your phone apple's face ID
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:21.480]   Just stopped working apple backed down on that and then this is the ultimate or is it the ultimate back down wesley falconer apple
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.760]   Tells tells you how to fix your phone
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:31.720]   My reaction immediately like when I read this is as it feels like they just created a whole nother economy
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.360]   So this is going to be very transformative for some people some groups
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.960]   um
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.800]   just like um
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.920]   the
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.800]   Freedom of information act didn't mean that everyone
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:50.360]   Can pretend I mean you legally could participate in the government for information there'll be a few people who are like
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.960]   I'll go through this trouble. It'll be worth it for me to make sure that
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:41:01.320]   Um, I can help me my friends and then of course words gonna travel that say like hey didn't you know wesley can fix your thing
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.320]   It'll he only just need to toss him a couple books
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.880]   Um or he'll do it for free. He already has the equipment. You just need to pay for the part
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.840]   the from that aspect of like empowering individuals and
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:18.840]   People to start companies to help with their own community with repairing these devices is going to be great
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.440]   I remember uh Christina Warren. I think mentioned that her
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.240]   Screen broke she was overseas
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.640]   She had her oh, yes
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:33.160]   And then she couldn't use her fingerprint reader because it wasn't considered an authorized repair right
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.560]   uh, and so
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:42.360]   That would be a case where like she can get empowered by someone else being able to get the authorized equipment, but also
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:47.880]   What this also does is makes every broken iphone
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:55.640]   uh a source of of money because you can not only take something that's not working and then be able to
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   upcycle it have someone else use it
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.160]   but
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.080]   Apple will buy bar buy back all the broken parts
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:08.040]   And so you'll get store credit and so this person who's doing all these repairs
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.920]   You can they can charge for the replacement
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.200]   But when they in mass take all these broken parts and send them to apple they get a credit
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.440]   Which means that they're actually be able to have some other
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.280]   Value that they can bring back is like um, I mean you can
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:28.200]   Rook cycle cans and then you see homeless people going through trash cans and trying to like take all the stuff out
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.160]   And being able to recycle it because they're creating an economy for this thing that used to be a throwaway
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:38.040]   Yeah, I think that I think the thing that's really interesting about this program even
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:44.920]   You know, it's really exciting that apple is is deciding to sell this stuff to individuals and to businesses that can do this
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:51.000]   I think the recycling bit is really interesting because apple has sold itself for a long time on you know
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.280]   The fact that so much of its supply chain is renewables
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:00.200]   And I think the fact that you know if you've got a busted screen you can send it back to apple and and get some store credit
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.520]   I think one that speaks to a
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:08.600]   Really interesting sort of ethical place that apple is clearly wanting to say that they come from I think
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:14.440]   Two it goes beyond even what the sort of right to repair legislation that a lot of states are trying to enact
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.920]   It goes even beyond that so it makes them sort of
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:23.880]   Quite difficult to sort of to criticize or legislate against but also possibly like do we think that's a symptom of like
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:30.120]   Just how bad the supply chain problems are that like apple is quite happy to have your own
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:37.000]   Go ahead. Let's fix it. We can't we can't get any more screens from yeah from china. So we'll fix this one
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.200]   I think it's a symptom of them moving into more of a service economy, right? Like well
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.840]   They they let's face it more devices more services
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.960]   They were getting a lot of headwind from the EU and from congress and it may have been a defensive move
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:57.400]   Because they felt like we better do it was I think it was definitely defensive. Yeah, it's definitely a defensive move
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.880]   And I agree with both
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:06.040]   Will and wesley about some new economy options here. I think there are going to be new businesses sprouting from this
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:11.960]   However, I'm thinking of older, you know users like myself. Um, I take my iphone six in a bit
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.280]   I mean I wanted to get the battery replaced and I didn't want them to do it
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.800]   So I didn't want to pay for them to do it
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:24.920]   So I sent away for a kit to put the battery in and when it came I had real issues put just putting the battery in now
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.720]   I'm not a tech
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.960]   Expert, but I should been able to do that fairly easily. I couldn't do it
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:38.040]   I eventually had to take it back to apple ham put the battery in so when it comes to like a broken screen or something like that
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.360]   There's no way. I think that what's going to happen is I think a lot of older users
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:47.160]   Are going to just hire somebody young, you know to fix it, you know for them
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:52.360]   Maybe to save some money from going to the shop itself, but I think they're right
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.960]   I think we're going to see a lot a lot of new jobs come up as a result of this
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.920]   the chat room is pointing out that
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:04.680]   This may and it's not coincidental. This probably was due to a shareholder
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.760]   lawsuit
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:13.240]   a shareholder group was suing it over right to repair and the shareholder resolution
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.240]   uh
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.760]   actually
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.760]   Came due on that wednesday
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:26.200]   Yeah, the announcement follows months of growing pressure. This is from the verge from repair activists and regulators
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:32.600]   Its timing seems deliberate considering a shareholder resolution environmental advocates filed with the company in september
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:40.680]   Asking apple to reevaluate its stance on independent repair wednesday was a key deadline in the fight over the resolution with advocates
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:45.720]   poised to bring the issue to the securities and exchange commission so apple forestall
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.560]   that uh
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.720]   Suit going to se the sec
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:55.240]   apple said no no no this has been in development for well over a year which actually makes sense
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.600]   um
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.480]   Because you don't you don't roll this out in an instant
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:08.520]   Nevertheless the timing seems perhaps a little influenced by that shareholder lawsuit the announcement the announcement timing is very
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:16.760]   interesting right now a lot of people including martin piers writing and the information were skeptical he calls it apple's pointless
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.480]   self-repair program
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:25.000]   He says it's hard to see this is anything other than theater apples responding to pressure from the ftc
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.960]   And since most people struggle even to put a screen protector onto their phone
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:36.200]   It's hard to imagine many will feel comfortable unscrewing the back and replacing one of the 200 parts apple will make available
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.360]   But I think wesley you made an excellent point
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.280]   And this is the first thing that came to mind. It doesn't mean i'm going to make that repair
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.560]   It means I could go to apple say i have an ifo 12. I need a new screen
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.720]   I can buy that part from apple
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:51.400]   And then I could bring it to somebody an independent repair store or you wesley
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.960]   And and pay you to fix it and then send the parts back to apple for a credit
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.400]   I think that is gonna that is gonna expand
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.440]   The the availability of repairs
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.840]   Yeah, what's in the mall?
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:10.120]   And I was just saying you can go to the kiosk in the mall which is probably like five feet from the entrance of the apple store
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.280]   Yeah, probably get this down too
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:16.840]   I think what I think what's disappointing though probably the thing that is the most kind of
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:24.360]   Is this is currently for iphone 12 and 13 only the most recent. Yeah, that's it
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.720]   Of course, it's really the people with sixes that need repairs
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:32.760]   Yeah, that needs to be repaired. Yeah, I mean nobody's battery is dead on an iphone 13 already
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:40.040]   So it's really um, you know, they and there's no plans as they currently have said to start rolling this backwards
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.600]   It seems like it's gonna start from 12 and go forwards rather than allow you to go back to
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.080]   11x 9
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:53.480]   You know, which is which is not great. They do say that they're gonna do the same thing with mac computers and the m1 chips
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.280]   Uh, so
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:03.400]   That's gonna start early next year and continue in the u.s. And continue additional countries throughout 2022 according to the press release
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.480]   Um
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.200]   You know, it's they've been so intractable on this
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:14.520]   Any movement I agree it's not changing the world, but any movement in this direction is very positive. I think
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:20.120]   But also it challenges all the other manufacturers to do the same now. Yes, so yes
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:25.480]   You get rid of a headphone jack and then everyone needs to get rid of it. So yeah people do copy apple
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.320]   I also hope that it means that they will make phones that are more repairable
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.360]   Because part of the problem is these are you know, they actually have to make special machines
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.720]   That they send to the apple stores so that they can get these things apart and put in new parts
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.520]   The apple stores have special equipment to do this in many cases
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:47.560]   Glue involved a lot of glue. Yeah, yeah, no, I repaired
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:53.800]   I fix it, which is a former sponsor. I think they let's get let's say former sponsor. I fix it.com
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:59.640]   Uh, and kyle weans their ceo been and founder been very very big on right to repair
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.600]   I had a pixel for the battery swole up popped the back off
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.440]   Uh, I ordered a I ordered a battery from them
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.000]   Was a it was I don't know if it's original equipment, but it was legit. I put it in
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.560]   You know, I had to remove some glue strips. You're right. They they send you a
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:23.480]   Uh, like it looks like a little muffler that you put in the microwave to heat it up that you put on the back of it to melt the glue
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:28.200]   So you can take the thing off, but it worked. I was able to repair it
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.760]   Uh, it was it was only 50 bucks something like that
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.680]   Um, and it gave me a new phone for a while until like the pixel six came out
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.200]   So I like this idea and I do think some phones are more repairable. I would love to see more screws
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:45.320]   On the back of phones the pixel, uh, let me see if the pixel six. No, I don't see any screws
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.720]   I think a lot of phones are glued together
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.720]   Um, so I think that's the next step and I'd like to see that make these things more repairable
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.080]   It's just the right thing. We don't want to see these things in the in the dump
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.560]   We don't see them in the landfill
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.320]   Yep
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.480]   Okay, so um
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   I know it's you know, it's kind of um
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:10.120]   O'Korant to be skeptical of anything apple does and
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:15.000]   You know, oh, you're just doing it because you have to or because of legislation or lawsuits
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.640]   But I I think they deserve a little pat on the back
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:24.760]   Um, I'll I'll be the first to say good. Good. Now. Keep doing it. Now. Let's just fix this app store thing and uh
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:29.000]   And you'll have something
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.120]   Um
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.040]   All right. Good. We've decided it's good
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   one thing not good activation blizzard
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:39.880]   they've been doing everything they can to live down their image as a uh, a
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.400]   Stu of
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.400]   Sad everything sexual harassment
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:48.920]   They can do more they could do more and yeah, it feels like they've got a long way to go before they've done everything to live it
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:58.120]   In fact a hundred workers walked out this week, uh at activation blizzard demanding the ceo stepped down of course
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.960]   he is uh
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.400]   often
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.880]   considered to be part of the reason they've had such
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:09.000]   Problems and now microsoft has said we're not going to do a business with activation blizzard
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.880]   And uh, sony indicates they might do the same thing with the ps5 that is that's when you start getting some pressure
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.000]   Well
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Go early x
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.360]   Apparently xbox is evaluating a relationship now with yeah, yeah, they're microsoft's not gonna
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.960]   Uh, I don't know what it means. We're are they're gonna not you can't not have
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.160]   micro i think it's i think it's the equivalent of you know, we need to have a talk
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:41.800]   It's like you're not necessarily ending it, but uh, you definitely need some changes
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.520]   I mean, I think that just the most improbable like you could not
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.520]   Punch yourself in the face harder element of this entire thing
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.520]   Is that you know back in the summer when all this kicked off in the first place?
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:04.280]   Activision sort of committed to better equality particularly in its blizzard division and appointed a man and a woman as co-ceos of blizzard
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.280]   And then it turns out this week paid the woman less for
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:15.400]   Oh my god, and when she asked and only you know, this only came out when she asked for a pay rise
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.480]   They initially said no
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.560]   You can't have a pay rise to be on the equal pay of your co-ceo
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.880]   And then she quit and then they offered her and they offered her then equal paying
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.320]   It's like oh my word when when you have a sort of, you know
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:33.880]   Sex discrimination scandal in your point ceos, you know a man and a woman
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:39.480]   Maybe consider paying them the same thing because otherwise you really are face planting from day one
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.880]   Yeah, we're in that kind of
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.480]   Yeah
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.840]   Was the word tone deaf mean anything here. Yeah, let me think yeah
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.680]   Big big expose in the Wall Street Journal when you start seeing the articles in the Wall Street Journal
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.200]   Um
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.480]   That's when you start getting serious stock price down 10 over the week
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:01.880]   Xbox chief saying you got some explaining to do
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.880]   uh
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.720]   PlayStation sony saying
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:10.840]   How do you plan to address the journals reporting here?
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:15.720]   um, I think it's just a matter of time before cotix steps down bobby cotnik and
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:21.640]   And they've got a new ceo in there. It just seems like the this is you've got to deal with this somehow
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.120]   The companies or really I feel go ahead. I feel like they've got you know
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:31.320]   Cotic is the guy that that delivered activation out of the wilderness right 15 20 years ago
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.320]   The board is a lot of his hand picked people and it's really hard, you know
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:42.440]   For to see them, you know so far the shareholders that have you know been aggravating for for cotix to go a kind of less than 10
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:46.120]   At the shareholding and it's like it kind of feels like unless
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:51.640]   Unless microsoft and sony really demands something they're just going to try and weather it. Yeah
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.800]   the uh, they want to two two boards members like two of the most
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:00.920]   Uh the longest serving board members to leave as well. Not just the ceo. Yeah, um, so the
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.200]   Yeah, don't expect any action from the board in other words
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:11.640]   It's like micros or micros, circubergs pro board right they're not going to do anything the board did release a statement
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:18.520]   Saying quote it remains committed to the goal of making activation blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the industry
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:26.120]   I'm sorry. It's hard not to laugh and is confident in bobby codice lady is right. It's a joe. It is a joke
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:33.080]   And they're confident in codice leadership commitment and ability to achieve these goals someday down the road
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.200]   Um
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.800]   Okay, he had there was a there was a statement by um
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:45.160]   Somebody it was credited to somebody at an activation a couple of months ago
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.160]   Um, uh one of the senior female executives at activation
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:55.960]   That um that cotnik came out and and denounced at the time and said this was sort of not reflective of what we of what we believed
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.920]   And it turns out that he'd actually ghost written the memo
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.480]   So he ghost written the we're mode giving it to this woman to publish and then absolutely um
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:10.120]   Um sort of distanced himself from it and said it was the wrong thing. So I mean it just keeps on getting worse and worse and worse
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:14.040]   Here's the story from five days ago in the wall street journal activation
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.440]   CEO bobby codic knew for years
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.480]   About sexual misconduct allegations
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.920]   Didn't inform the board of some reports including alleged rapes
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.760]   Company faces multiple regulatory investigations
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:30.440]   It's just
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.960]   It's sad because you know what he did he did a good thing for activation
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:39.160]   Uh, and all he had to do was the right thing for women at activation and I guess
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:40.520]   I
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.800]   Couldn't do that
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.760]   Is is it the is it the frat boy culture?
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:50.440]   I think I think these companies scored it side of yeah think that we have to allow this or we're not going to have
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:56.760]   The programmers to do the games we need to do no so no no as a frat as a frat boy
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:02.840]   I can tell you I disagree with that strongly, um, but coming out of the pandemic especially
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:08.520]   It's not just money. It's morals. It's it's being able to say that i'm proud to work here
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.880]   And the my job takes care of me. That's very important nowadays
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.440]   And this um when I said like it sounds like apple again about equal pay is because
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:23.800]   That we have a story about how there was a movement there and then how that went to we're really wrong for the people who are just speaking up
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.560]   but it was so
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:30.680]   Like this is so strong like to make sure that your employer
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:36.600]   Knows that it's made up of employees who are humans and should treat humans
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.560]   with compassion and
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.840]   in
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.160]   I I want to also say I commend
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.400]   Microsoft
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.240]   for being able to
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.680]   Take a big hit when they're already the number two and consoles
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:55.720]   But knowing that activation and and call of duty is like very highly aligned
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.440]   Yeah, and that they're willing to take like a hit
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.680]   To injure themselves to do something that is right. I think speaks volumes
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:07.160]   And also speaks to the microsoft employees who are probably speaking up and saying
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.720]   We need to do something about this and I think that is the underlying tone
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.480]   Companies need to take care of their people that is a trend in general
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:22.360]   It certainly started in the tech community where employees were so important the engineers were so important that they could actually stand up and say
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:27.640]   We don't want you to do defense work or we want you to treat a females or uh black people with
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.560]   better and that that has now spread
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:40.120]   To I think the entire workforce and it's interesting to see workers feel more empowered all of a sudden as they should be
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:46.440]   Uh, and you know didn't didn't google start that a few years ago. It certainly happened at google
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:52.120]   It did and by the way google's still not off the hook for firing a number of people
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.880]   For act for act being activists
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:59.880]   That they still have acted badly and they've never really
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.920]   Paid the price they they paid off
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:08.040]   The creator of android what was it? He got 90 million dollars
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.720]   After being forced out of the company for sexual harassment allegations
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:17.080]   Uh most recently fired two of the people working on their ai ethics
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.960]   department for
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.440]   Maybe being women, but maybe also being
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.760]   Upstart
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:30.600]   feisty women and saying they also fired their head of the recruiter that recruited for hbc
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.360]   Yeah
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.440]   All right, so I don't think google's should be off the hook yet. I think they've just they've just
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:43.400]   Yeah, but they've had some groups of employees that have stood up. Oh, they've been very active. Yeah as have microsoft employees
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.880]   uh amazon employees
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.880]   Uh, but here's the problem
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:54.920]   Underconnex leadership the company's market value has gone up in 10 years from 14 billion to 54 billion
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:59.560]   Wow and those numbers talk they speak to the board they speak to stakeholders
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:03.880]   They speak to wall street, but when you get the wall street journal and suddenly writing articles about you
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.720]   I think you know on the board the time has come I think maybe well
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:12.520]   You also can't say that number was because of him. I think those numbers are in spite of him
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:14.280]   Those
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:21.000]   Think about how much the money more money they would have made if people loved working there and maybe stayed longer or maybe decided to
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.240]   present their ideas of unique
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:30.280]   Gaming uh, franchises could have been born that were very good point. This very good point
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.800]   Atmosphere there. Yeah, call a duty candy crush world of warcraft
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:37.400]   But what other great ideas did you not see?
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.280]   Because you know that that's
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.280]   Excellent point
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:46.440]   Um caudex pay package in 2020 a hundred fifty four million dollars
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.680]   Wow, he's the one of the highest paid chief executives in the us
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:56.360]   Um after the journal approached activation with questions for this article
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:04.280]   The journal says caudex told employees he'd asked the board to reduce his total annual compensation to 62,500
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:11.960]   And that the company was implementing a zero tolerance harassment policy and ending mandatory arbitration for harassment discrimination claims
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.880]   Where did he come up with 60,000
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.440]   Yeah, it's so that's the minimum in the state of i believe it's the state of california
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.720]   It's the minimum amount that you can pay for someone in that pay band
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.720]   So it's a bizarrely like sort of like absolute government regulation
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.520]   Someone at that level has to be paid that money
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:40.360]   Work for a buck a buck a year for a buck. Yeah, but that was before before this legislation came in i believe
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.000]   Well, i'm glad that ceos are protected
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.440]   So that they can't earn so little we want to keep those ceos above the poverty line
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:56.600]   Leo i think i'd probably take the steve jobs buck if i'd made a hundred fifty million the year before you i probably survived
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.200]   I survived
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.680]   Salary is not equal to compensation. Well, and that's the other thing like uh bonuses
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.000]   Yeah, there's like equity. There's all this stuff. So on paper 60 something
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.840]   Thousand dollars. Yeah, but you're probably getting no he did say so compensation
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.560]   It's the minimum allowed out of california law for salaried workers
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.920]   62.5
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.800]   He would he'd also said he'll forgo bonuses and equity grants
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.440]   But as you say last year he got 154 millions
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.600]   So he's he's still gonna be able to take attunus this sandwich to finish sandwich the luncheon
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.760]   Yeah
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.440]   You you're a salinity worker. Do you
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.200]   You don't make that much, john
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:38.120]   Uh lisa's probably left by now i hope
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.440]   You you make more than that, don't you?
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.960]   I hope you do it's um the minimum
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.520]   Galley we might have a walk in
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.680]   We might have a walk out on our hands right now
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.880]   Not 600
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.720]   62,500
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:01.880]   You make more than that. Yeah, nobody here it makes less than that. Are you salaried john? You're hourly
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.520]   You don't do a time card
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.320]   Well, we have to work on that. I want to cut your pace or you can uh
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.840]   We can get you for 12 bucks an hour
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:15.240]   Uh, no you deserve as much as we pay you and uh buck more
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:22.120]   Yeah, uh, who that scared me for a minute. He thought it was six pain and mft's he's i was six hundred two thousand
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:29.240]   Stop stop paying people in bitcoin leo or twig. I love it twig coin twig coin. We're gonna pay everybody in twig coin
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.880]   Anyway, uh, i'm taking my appearance fee in twig coin. Yes
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.160]   California fair employment
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:42.280]   Department of failed employment housing has opened the securities exchange commission all investigating
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.320]   Uh, it's not over for activation blizzard that story will continue
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.040]   I wouldn't be and I think that's the interesting thing
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:55.080]   Um is that it will continue and I think there was a big worry back in the summer when this all
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:01.400]   Kicked off for the first time that this would be one of those stories that created a huge ruckus for a few weeks
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:07.240]   And then just got swept under the carpet and nobody came back to it and everything just went back to
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.920]   Kind of being crappy for the people there and so if we're gonna take anything positive from the situation
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:19.640]   Is that people are still talking about this and still being active around this and still pushing for this to be made right?
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:23.240]   And we haven't just brushed it under the carpet. I think that says something about
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.440]   The state of where we are right now. We can thank the wall street journal for that. I think largely
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.560]   But when you see somebody somebody as uh establishment and corporate as a wall street journal
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:40.440]   Saying something. I think that's that's a signal. You know, that that's the you know times up as they say
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:47.400]   Uh, let's take a little break come back with nice. You like that. You like that? Yeah, uh-huh. Uh-huh. It's good. Very good
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:53.080]   Wesley Faulkner's here. Tell us about uh databases
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.880]   singlestore.com
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.200]   singlestore single store databases. So usually there are
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:06.840]   Generally two types of databases one you do data ingest and one you do your analytical processing
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:15.160]   Uh, so when you do that you have to copy the data over from where you originally got all of the data into this
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:21.800]   Place that does all the processing you or you do your artificial intelligence and to actually get some actional insights out of it
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:27.080]   Uh singlestore allows you to do all of that in one database, which means you only have one copy of your data
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.160]   That's needed so you don't have to pay for having two different databases
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.080]   It's single technology and you also don't have to pay for storage of that is
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:42.440]   Duplicated from going in this old process and so not only is it allow you to uh, do this in one system
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:46.280]   Because you don't have to do the transfer. It actually happens really fast
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:52.040]   So we can do we're one of the fastest analytical if not the fast and analytical database out there
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.600]   That can do inject ingest and transform your data into actionable insights
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:02.440]   So, you know, so Wesley. I'd like to get your take on a graphical databases in the future
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:08.920]   Um of of those in uh in it and enterprise it what's a graphical database?
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.760]   You don't mean like with pictures you mean graphs like
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:20.280]   Oh, well it means a between two. Yeah, yeah, two. I mean graph database not graphical graph database like tiger b or
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.680]   neo4j or one of those
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.720]   What do you think the future is of those because they're starting to grow?
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:31.080]   Uh in use versus say relational data versus relational. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:35.480]   Well graphic databases are hard and very specialized that I think
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:41.640]   Even if we are we do do some graphical and transformations, but of course you will get better
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   Uh, transformations and the specialized database for graphical. Um, but um
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.240]   something in terms of like uh single store we do like
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.600]   80 percent of the use cases so we do most of it that people use
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.080]   um, but uh graphical databases for those who are trying to um
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.440]   Understand what relational instead of like
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.120]   uh
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:10.920]   For a graphical database is kind of like would you use facebook or yeah, social graph or the knowledge graph. Yes. Yes, right social
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:17.240]   Yeah, yeah of saying who's connected to who and whose relationship and it's not as higher or rational because so
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:24.840]   So instead of being a hierarchical database, everything's connected to everything else is more like life to be honest. Yes, it's a big mesh
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.920]   But it's a hard thing to do
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:31.080]   Uh, it's a as microsoft is want to say it's a tough computer science problem
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.800]   I think I think my major question would be I mean
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.000]   Just hearing what you're saying and if I'm if I'm hearing you correctly
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.600]   You can help me transform my graphical appearance to improve my relationships. Not right
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:46.040]   No, no, but
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.040]   You somehow
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.920]   Well
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.960]   Yeah, if you pay enough money than yes, we can do it
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.880]   say
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:01.960]   the graph databases connect a lot of dots that are already in place and um, and they're they're very quick
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.280]   They're very fast at what they do
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:10.440]   and um and more and more businesses are learning how to use them and google and facebook and linked in a lot of others are already using them
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:15.960]   And um, this all the social networks are using them right now, but that's good. That's gonna trickle down
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.880]   Yeah, it's just the percentage of the space that rely on graphical databases still relatively tiny
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:28.280]   With all of the other use cases like with do spatial time series. There's all kinds of different specialized databases
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:35.240]   Um, we do a lot of those things. So like I said, we do probably like 80 of the the the functions that you'll need to do some of those things
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.720]   Um, but yeah, I agree
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.680]   Relational databases are extremely specialized, but um, they help you tease out insights
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.800]   From like if this person likes these things then they probably like these things which is connected to this thing
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:53.400]   Right. It's so it really really brings that data to the forefront. Yeah, it goes hand-in-hand with
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:58.440]   um, artificial intelligence for sure. Yeah, absolutely and uh
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:04.760]   If a Riley were an advertiser, I would tell you they have a big sale on their graph algorithms brand new
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:11.240]   Just go out. Yep. Yep. I've been trying to learn a little bit about this because uh, it is soon to be
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.040]   December 1st the advent of code
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.520]   begins
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:24.040]   And I always try to do this solve this. Uh, I know listeners have watched me bang my head against the wall
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.920]   It's really fun. It's uh 50 programming problems
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.840]   Um
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.920]   Two a day for 25 days as you get from December 1st to December 25th
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.960]   Usually having something to do with santa claws and elves
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.200]   And uh, they're really fun and I usually get to about day six before I go ah
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.840]   And the thing that's always stops me
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.880]   Is is frankly is uh graphs
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:51.000]   So I'm trying to get it's odd that you should have asked that question christ because i'm trying to get good at this
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.320]   Uh because I only have two more weeks to understand it
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:00.280]   There are tons of graphical libraries that you can do. I know I know well i'm trying to do it in lisp
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:03.480]   There you go. There's my property there right there. Okay, not show
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.240]   Uh, I tried to do lisp, but I use uh try to use like a
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.920]   An elixir or I use like google home and it just cannot understand you understand your risk
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:19.400]   Actually somebody on reddit. There's a slash r/lisp which is about the lisp programming language
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.280]   Somebody posted on there. How do I get rid of my lisp and that as you might imagine
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.080]   Went nowhere
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.520]   Um, so we'd like to announce our new studio manager
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:35.000]   Welcome to no john you're still here right you're not leaving yet
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.520]   Okay, 600 $2,000 he wants
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.080]   That's it
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:48.280]   Our show today brought to you by i'll get you a privacy card. How about that privacy dot com that I don't not I do not now
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.760]   By anything online
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:55.480]   With my regular credit cards. I use my privacy cards. I love these
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.240]   I have now created hundreds of them and i'll tell you why
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.360]   Every time you create a privacy dot com card. It looks like a regular credit card to the vendor
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.440]   But you could you have a few choices you can have it be a one-time only card they use it. That's it can never be used again
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.800]   More often i'll use the merchant specific card
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:20.040]   So when I set up my amazon account, I create a privacy card for amazon and only amazon can use that card
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:24.680]   If anybody else tries to it's declined immediately. It's eliminated fraud
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.880]   For when i'm by online. It's it's brilliant
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.560]   There's one other reason you want a privacy well, there's many reasons
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.040]   But there's one other big reason
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:39.640]   And it's the only time whenever i'm using of setting up a subscription or a recurring payment
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:45.400]   I've learned my lesson. I use my privacy dot com credit cards
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:50.920]   It lets you control your subscriptions recurring payments so that you're never accidentally build twice
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.840]   Or upgraded to another service without your consent and and furthermore
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.560]   You can set a spending limit with any privacy card so they can't overcharge you
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:04.760]   And uh, and and if you are tired of the subscription, you don't have to jump through hoops
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.120]   You just pause your privacy card and that's it
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:13.080]   That's it. No, you don't have to call the customer service or anything privacy blocks the charges
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:18.440]   And they'll also notify if somebody tries to charge over the allotted amount you always stay within your budget
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:22.680]   I just think it's great. The another way I use privacy cards. I've mentioned this before
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:28.600]   Uh, my mom who's 88. She lives in Rhode Island. She she just doesn't want to cook anymore. I don't blame her
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.600]   She cooked for me my whole childhood
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.000]   Brilliant cook and I said mom don't cook. Let me buy you dinner
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.840]   I gave her a privacy card and as soon as she used it with uh camera was door. I think was door dash
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.400]   It locked in the door dash
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.720]   I I said use it anytime you want and it was really easy to share with her
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.960]   There's no copy and paste. I didn't have to text message or screenshot or anything
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.680]   They don't need a privacy card account
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:59.240]   I just clicked the share button when I'm created the card for a correct click click a share button
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:04.760]   Gave them her email address and privacy handled the rest. So it was really great. She's 88
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.280]   I didn't want to make a complicated thing for it made it very easy for her
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:15.880]   Uh, there's a chrome extension a firefox extension that will automatically fill out credit card information create new cards for you on demand
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.280]   You can you I can go on and on. I'm a big fan of this. I've been using it for years
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.840]   I just think it's so great. I get a great account summary every month makes it easy for me to track how much i've been
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:31.880]   Spending they've got a summary page now. It's great for budgeting. You can filter by day and they've just added tagging which is really good
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.200]   Uh because I have so many privacy cards because I created a new card for every merchant
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:42.760]   You can tag it so you can start your cards by category makes it very easy. I just think this is the best thing ever
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.040]   Now I should explain it's not a charge card. You don't run a balance
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.400]   You tie it into your debit card or to your bank account
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:56.120]   So don't think of it as a as a charge card think of it as a way to securely use a credit card anywhere
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.800]   You don't want to give your credit card number out anywhere. You don't want the merchant to know anything about you
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:08.600]   Uh, it masks your real bank information your statement your bank statement will say exactly who all the charges went to if you want
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:13.400]   So you know you can turn that off to if you don't want to have that information. I just think it's great
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.880]   Protect your financial identity online
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.760]   Virtual cards with privacy calm go to privacy calm slash twit
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.080]   Sign up for an account if you're a new customer you'll get five bucks to spend on your first purchase
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:28.520]   That's our way of saying thank you for using that address so they know you saw it here
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.120]   privacy
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.480]   dot com
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.520]   Slash
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.240]   Twit sign up now. I I hope I've convinced you this is the best thing ever
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.160]   Credit card companies used to do these burner cards. They stopped
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.320]   Privacy does it and I like it's wonderful privacy.com slash
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.120]   Twit. Thank you privacy. Can I say something about privacy? Yes
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.400]   the limits or
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.040]   per charge per month or like
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.760]   Per the whole entire thing and I use it for my cell phone bill
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:07.160]   Yeah, and one and one month it should be the same same and then went over the limit and I got it auto denied by privacy
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.840]   This isn't that awesome. They just charged and so I said what was and so I called the my cell phone provider
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.320]   It's like what happened and it was a billionaire and you know how they take on extra fees for nothing
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.600]   Yeah, and so it saved my butt you can't be stuffed
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:26.040]   You know because that's another problem with cell phone companies is is you get these extra stuffing charges
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.440]   They can't pull one over and yeah, it's great
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:33.880]   Yeah, I'm a big fan. How does business model work for them is it per
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:39.640]   A person said it's like a credit card. I think they get the credit card fee. They're happy to get that
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.560]   I
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.880]   You should look go go sign up because there's different levels
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.240]   I have a plan and I think if you have enough charges a month, it's uh
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:53.080]   You can it pays for itself. I pay a little extra to them
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.440]   like 10 bucks a month to get 1% back
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:59.640]   But I use so much that it's you know a net
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.480]   Much
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:07.080]   Net positive for me. So they have fees and there's business fees too. So there's ways to they monetize
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.880]   Obviously they monetize they can buy an ad on twit
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:14.600]   So and I hope they monetize because I man. I don't want them to ever stop
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.840]   American Express used to do this discovery used to do this and they all stopped. I don't know why
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.640]   Um, maybe merchants don't like it. They probably don't
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.640]   But the merchant doesn't know it looks like a normal credit card to them. They don't know
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.400]   ah
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.520]   And today's sunday, but I saw that they started
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.240]   Black friday today with like at cole's. Oh, yeah, of course places
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.920]   Of course and so if you if there's also there's some sketchy vendors out there that you want to buy something
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:46.280]   Using the one-time merchant card is highly advisable. Oh god. I was talking with a friend
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:52.840]   Uh, I used to buy phone cases. They made these beautiful leather phone cases from a company in argentina
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:58.120]   But every time I used a credit card it would buy the case, but they would buy a few other things and
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:04.680]   It was not good. So uh, yeah, I mean a lot of times when you're online and you're buying from somebody you don't know
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.760]   It's a great way to go boy. They just got an extra couple of minutes on that ad
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:13.480]   Uh, but you know what something we try to do adds for companies and do good stuff
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.520]   And it's not unusual for people go. Yeah, I use that
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.440]   Uh apple cars are coming
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:27.800]   Nope, no, uh, no steering wheels no steering wheels one button rolls just a button
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.440]   you push a button and
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:36.440]   And this is supposed to be by like 2030 or 2025. Yeah, they're uh 2025
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:40.600]   So we've been hurrying this rumor for a decade that apple is going to do a car
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:46.040]   I actually never credited except for the fact that's at least we know there's at least a thousand people working there
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:51.000]   They keep hiring away big executives engineers from companies like tesla
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.360]   Um, and now mark german has the story on bloomburg. He is definitely the best connected
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.200]   apple rumor guy. He says apple's pushing to accelerate development of its electric car
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.160]   focusing around full self-driving
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.280]   according to people familiar with the matter
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.120]   um
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.960]   And kevin lynch this just happened a couple of months ago
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.760]   The guy who really made the apple watch what it was has been moved over
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:24.680]   Uh to apple cars, which usually means when when apple does that kind of executive move
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:32.440]   It's like okay time to kick their series. There's there's there's sir. Yeah, um, apple shares went up 2.4
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.320]   After this bloomburg story. So it's not just other people believe it
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:43.320]   Uh project titan has been around since 2014 so it's been seven years now
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.520]   Wow
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:49.800]   Uh the former head of the team left in september to go to ford after three years in charge and that's when lynch
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.360]   kevin lynch came in
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.320]   um
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.840]   Not a car guy
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:58.200]   But a product guy and a guy who can bring a product to market
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.720]   So this will be uh very interesting to see of course apple has no comment
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:11.640]   And you're wrong by the way chris. I know I thought you were joking apple's ideal car would have no steering wheel and petals
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.240]   Yep
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.680]   I thought you were joking
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:18.760]   No, I am i am a maid of facts here
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:25.160]   He is a man made of facts its interior would be designed around hands-off driving
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.160]   Uh, they one option discussed according to blermburg
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:35.720]   Features and interiors similar to the one in the canoe lifestyle vehicle, which is basically a living room
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.440]   on wheels
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:43.720]   Like curious you sit along the sides of the vehicle and face each other like you wouldn't a stretch
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:50.600]   You could ever cocktail party. Yeah. Yeah. Get into an accident facing sideways. That feels good. Oh, yeah
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:56.360]   I think what's really tough about this is is it's it's kind of difficult to see
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:02.280]   Uh what value like apple is gonna bring beyond software
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:06.840]   You know if if the key to a self-driving car basically is is software
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.560]   It's not really a combination of software and hardware
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:17.640]   It's difficult to see what apple's gonna do that that isn't going to be replicable because I mean if you think back to the original iphone
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:25.080]   The thing that made a lot of the iphone features so compelling on that original iphone in 2007 was the fact they they basically
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.680]   um
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:31.720]   Twisted atnt's arm into providing a lot of iphone specific features
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:38.040]   You remember like visual voicemail wasn't something that existed and was something that apple sort of negotiated with atnt
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:46.120]   As a sort of special provision of of their hardware being on that carrier and it's difficult to see how kind of apple is going to go to
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.840]   You know states and say
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:55.080]   Create road networks that specifically have some feature that's going to work for the apple phone or or do anything
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:59.080]   You know apple was able has always been able to create its own ecosystem
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:04.120]   But the problem with roads is that they are by definition an open ecosystem
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.560]   So it's hard to see how apple can leverage anything proprietary here's uh
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.880]   Here's a CNN's one of those CNN's editor former jalapna getter
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.840]   Trying tesla's full
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:19.560]   self-driving system in new york city and just the picture alone will tell you
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:26.200]   He's constantly grabbing the wheel and saying no no not there no
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:31.560]   Uh, it's challenging especially when you have non self-driving vehicles competing with you
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.680]   In the same space in an unpredictable space
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.320]   Uh, the other problem for apple is you're i mean apples
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:43.320]   I guess every tech company has to do this and certainly car companies have to do this
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:47.240]   You're aiming in the distant three to five-year future
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:51.720]   Things could change a lot for instance. I don't know how much longer
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.320]   Personal ownership of cars is going to be around
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.120]   It's a very wasteful thing
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:03.880]   One thing I wanted to point out to if I could sorry to about what will said is like what could apple bring
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:07.560]   And that is working with municipalities there are
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:13.240]   So many sensors on roads today that people don't use
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:18.440]   You ever set it a red light and just wait for it to turn and it senses the car over a
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.080]   Mantometer that there is a car there and then it knows how long the cycle the light
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:30.600]   Those are all attached to sensors. So apple could definitely make agreements with municipalities in cities about how these
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.040]   how that data is collected housed and
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:40.440]   They could make use of that in the real time and or that's something that of scale that tesla has yet to do to work
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:44.600]   Formally with companies or sorry with municipalities to get that data and to formalize it
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.400]   And so that definitely could be an edge
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:52.600]   For them to roll this out, but I also agree that you know making a car is hard
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.520]   because you're dealing with other people and other humans on the road and
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.080]   animals and
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.760]   Too many variables that are broken. Yeah, there's there's so many variables
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.240]   But uh is possible five years though
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:10.200]   Which means that they would actually have to start building the car a year and a half at least before that
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:17.080]   2020 25 date because it takes so long just to build a car do you remember when elan was in production hell
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:21.320]   And they've made cars before and then they were trying to use make the model three
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.800]   It took them a while before they could even get working cars off that line
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:32.840]   Well, there was a rumor and I think it's probably uh true that apple wouldn't necessarily have to make the car there's certainly
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:38.120]   Conceivable they might do a deal with an a regular us on a manufacturer like
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:42.840]   Ford the rumor was that they were working with an austrian company magna
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.640]   That builds cars for a lot of companies
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:50.600]   Um, that's kind of what they are as a white label car manufacturer
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:57.880]   So they're in oem for cars. So you don't have to actually know how to build the car. They're building the new fisker
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:01.000]   Ocean, um, I think they build a toyota
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.360]   Uh, they build a number of cars. So in austria, so you don't have to actually
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.440]   Have the
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.320]   Auto-manifest it's I think you were right when you said
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:16.360]   Uh, will that it's a soft that is software that's really going to define an apple car
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:21.080]   Um, they may say we're going to give it the apple brand and the apple look and feel it'll be like
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.560]   a rolling apple store
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:25.720]   uh, you know a lot of maple and
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.520]   you know comfy chairs and
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:33.560]   Stools for the kids, but they don't have to make it. They just have to make it work
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.960]   Not that that's um an easy thing to do. I we've been hearing about
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:40.600]   level four and level five autonomy. I mean
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:46.040]   Elon said he'd have it two years ago. He said oh, you know by 2020
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:51.000]   Um, I think alons had full self-driving coming next next week
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   Without falling in
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.960]   Say one point that tesla owners would be able to just let anybody use their car
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:03.080]   They could rent it out as taxi when they're not using it things like that. It's hard apparently hard to do
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:09.400]   Reality setting in i'm not seeing any google autonomous cars around in mountain view at all anymore
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:13.400]   And we used to see them pretty rekmos. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.480]   I haven't seen one and well
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.480]   Covid has something to do with it probably i don't know
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:23.480]   Covid is the result or is he excused for a lot of things they're moving uh, there's been moving all those waymos up the peninsula
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:26.120]   San francisco. They are starting to do
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:29.080]   driverless
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.560]   Waymoe in san francisco not downtown that would be a little much to ask
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:36.200]   but out in the avenues
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:41.800]   And we did we had this story a couple of weeks ago about the self-driving waymos that got lost
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.800]   They kept going down the road in san francisco
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:50.440]   And and making you turns because they were obeying traffic laws no one else did
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:55.480]   But they were being traffic laws that said commercial vehicles can't drive down this so
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:59.880]   They ended up on a dead end 15th on 15th avenue where they'd have to turn around
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.760]   oh boy
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.120]   That's where they all went
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.920]   No, they're all on 15th avenue actually yeah chris that's that's where they all went
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.680]   It's still not a wonderful story for the future of self-driving vehicles. I think it's interesting
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:18.120]   I mean this apple rumor is you know a rumor that will never die
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:22.280]   Um, but it's pretty clear that they are putting money into it
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:26.200]   Um, when are we getting the tv that's what i will come on
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.000]   We're supposed to have a tv by now. Come on
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.800]   The tv will be in the car
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:39.000]   Well, that's you know, that's the other story is everybody's trying and testing out if you're not driving what are you going to do?
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.600]   Of course you're going to watch advertisements. What else would you do?
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:50.600]   So everybody's testing out all these all these screens in the car that you know with with content advertising supported content
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.400]   You wrote an interesting story, uh chris
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:58.760]   Uh about google's what is this called the bot in a box?
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.480]   Oh, yeah
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.920]   So that's that this is another kind of ai ai you could talk to
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:12.120]   Well, the this is a do it yourself one apparently, um, it's no code. Um, it's drag
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.000]   you know drag down menus and
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:21.880]   Um, line of business employees can build you can build their own bots, you know
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:27.640]   And that seems way out there for me, but this is this is the way of the future. I think with um
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.720]   With the way customers will connect with companies and vice versa
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.240]   Uh, are gonna be more and more of these um these bots
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:40.280]   And google's making it easier and easier to build these. Yeah, that's what that's all about
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:45.560]   This is no code. This is that new no code low code stuff. I'm sure you're all over that Wesley. This is
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.200]   What do you think of no code low code?
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.840]   Yeah, it enables more people to participate
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:56.840]   So which is great if if you just like uh, you know pivot tables is very low code
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:01.000]   But it's still not necessarily accessible to everyone who does sprints right? So
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.920]   Um, it's just making the level of entry a little bit lower
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:08.040]   So people who are inclined to build the stuff that can do it very interesting
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:12.040]   I wonder how much of duplex is built into this and i'm sure that they learned a lot from that project
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:17.320]   That's the voice thing that calls and makes a reservation in a restaurant for you or uh, yeah
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:24.520]   They announced that years a couple of years ago at google.io. It's slowly inching out into the real world
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:29.720]   Um, I can my my pixel six will now if I get put on hold
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:34.840]   Monitor it and and then tell me with that. Oh, there's there's somebody on the line for you
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.640]   And I think there's some duplex built into this as well with uh, um
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:45.480]   Navigating phone trees and stuff so it's slowly it's just like self-driving cars
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.360]   It's coming but it's coming
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:52.040]   Slower and in different ways than we might have expected and that's why I think apple
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.040]   Getting into the car business is interesting because I I think it's a hard thing to
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.760]   Aim five years in the future
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.920]   But after it's done that in the past and it's not the only project apple's working on
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:07.800]   I think they they're trying desperately to say what's next after the iphone including ar
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.440]   self-driving vehicles
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:14.600]   Um, john lewy gasey a couple of weeks ago on his monday note roto. I thought a pretty compelling piece saying
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.080]   The future for apple is health
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:22.040]   That's where there's gonna be billions of dollars. They're already in it with the apple watch and the iphone
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:27.960]   And if they can come up carcraft should we call 911? Yeah, I just turned that on by the way my google pixel
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.160]   Has a feature that says if you get in a car crash will call your wife
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:36.360]   I'm just waiting. I'm just waiting. I'm just waiting. I'm you know, I'm gonna run into the wall or something
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.200]   And it's gonna call my wife saying your husband's dead
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.880]   He's a really don't want anything that's gonna call my wife
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.000]   Basically
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.200]   Do that just feels like a residue what could possibly go wrong?
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:54.200]   Really? I think I think when you look at apple, you know when the interesting questions for them is you know, what's next?
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:29:00.520]   Is what's next what is left to who's the game sky? That was like any wept because there were no more lands left to conquer
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.520]   That's right. It's like
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:05.000]   What else is there the only thing that could move
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:12.280]   apple's market cap enough to generate return for shareholders is probably health or or cars
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.360]   Or I mean aviation maybe although it's not good margins in aviation
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.360]   I don't think we're gonna see an apple jet
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:22.680]   But there is certainly you know, it certainly doesn't seem to be much, you know, I joked about the apple tv
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:29.400]   But it's like there's no margins in making a television, you know, and I know we amming something and putting apple software in it
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.400]   They need an apple printer
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.040]   They had an apple printer
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.440]   They used to they was the first laser writer
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:43.880]   Five thousand we will we will have artificial intelligence living on Mars before we have a printer that reliably connects via air
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.600]   Print time positive of that. Yeah. Yeah
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:53.000]   Alexander cried he wept because there were no more lands to cuts the dude
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.120]   There's the english public school education coming to a fraud
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:06.360]   Let's take a little let's take a little break will hares. I love having you on will you're just the greatest
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:14.200]   Oh, it's always such great fun. And he's staying up late with us in England. It's uh, it is now midnight little after midnight in
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.560]   In london. So if you're an irish pub go home
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.880]   Um
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:23.400]   That was the funniest thing you can't you can't you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:28.360]   Can't stay here. That was the funniest thing. So there's a spike of uh covid thanks to delta. I think and
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:31.560]   Uh large numbers of unvaccinated people all over europe
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.960]   Ireland's uh choice
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.080]   To to knock this spike down is to close the pubs at midnight
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:40.200]   Well, that will do it
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.680]   It's just it's just it's a perfect solution
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:50.760]   Uh anything you want to you're doing uh congratulations on selling end tail. That's fantastic
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:56.200]   Uh, you deserve all that success. And so you're going to work for a dmg for a little bit
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.760]   Yeah, gonna work there working some interesting new projects for 2022
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:06.200]   And mostly just working on uh building up that twitter and instagram following so
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:13.960]   So keep hitting me up on at will arid. All right. All right. That's what really counts at will hares one l and will
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:19.160]   That's the most all all all about the self-promotion, isn't that? Yeah, that's it me up, baby
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:25.800]   Hey, we were talking about uh google and uh and robot text messaging
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.320]   but I want to actually talk about our sponsor podium because
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:33.160]   It really is the case that customers these days
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:39.400]   Uh expect to interact with you in a kind of more intimate way and I think some of this came from quarantine
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:45.240]   Because we were you know getting texts sending texts saying i'm going to pick up my donuts
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:50.520]   Have them out front or getting texts saying your food is on the way and more and more. That's how
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.800]   I think that's how we want to interact with businesses
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.280]   podium
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:01.480]   Is the ultimate text messaging platform for you and for your employees if you own a business
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:05.560]   You know there are not enough hours in a day to waste playing phone tag
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:08.520]   And your customers don't want to do it either, right?
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:14.360]   The list of customers you need to reach doesn't get any shorter, especially if business is good knock on what it's good for you
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:20.200]   That's why local businesses everywhere are turning to podium. It makes every interaction easy for you
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:25.880]   And easy for your customers as easy as sending text so everything that makes your business great can be done
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:30.280]   Faster perfect example left my dentist office the other day
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:34.680]   They sent me a text immediately saying your next appointment is here
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:38.120]   Press a click a link in the text and add it to the calendar
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:42.600]   I left the ice cream shop the other day. They said how is the ice cream leave us a review
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:47.080]   And of course you're much more likely having just had that delicious ice cream to say yeah
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:52.360]   Yeah, all the review on Yelp or google or whatever and podium empowers that
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:58.120]   But it's not just reviews. It's not just appointments. It's collecting payments. It's marketing
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:03.640]   Actually that same ice cream shop sends me a podium message every once in a while saying we haven't seen you in a while
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:08.040]   How would you like a 10% off our uh, rocky road coupon?
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:12.760]   That is mean that's just mean podium isn't a better way just a better way to communicate
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:17.400]   It's a better way to do everything whether it's gathering reviews collecting payments even marketing to your customers
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.680]   podium
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:24.360]   Makes it all as easy as pressing send you won't just free up more time for yourself
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:28.680]   You'll grow your business. You'll get more done and your customers will love you
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:34.040]   With podium you'll close deals with customers before the competition even has a chance to call them back
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:36.680]   That's another way podium is really cool
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.400]   Uh, I these days when i'm looking for somebody I had to find a glacier to fix a window
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:47.720]   Uh, I went online found a bunch of glaciers sent him texts saying give me a quote
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.120]   This is what I need and the guy who got back to me first. Guess what? He's the guy who got the job
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.720]   podium
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:59.080]   Join more than a hundred thousand businesses that already use podium to streamline their customer interactions

[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.400]   twit
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:42.280]   We're talking about this earlier today on the tech guy show rod piles our space expert
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.480]   Uh earlier this week, uh, the denizens of the international space station
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:55.320]   Russian cosmonauts along with americans, uh, were told to immediately evacuate the space station and go to their
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.880]   launch vehicles or capsules
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:00.520]   Because a debris field was on its way
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:07.080]   The debris field which did in fact pass by but missed thank goodness the space station
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:12.360]   Was created by a russian adela anti satellite test
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:17.320]   Uh, it destroyed one of its own satellites early monday
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:22.440]   sent thousands 1500 pieces of trackable fragments
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.560]   Uh into the uh into space 300 miles up
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:32.440]   not so far from the orbit of the international space station
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:40.600]   And they will be there moving at thousands of miles an hour imposing a threat to anything that will go across their path for years
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:44.360]   kind of irresponsible
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.280]   Um
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:51.560]   It's not by the way the russians aren't the only people have anti satellite technology a set
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:56.120]   Uh, we've done a set tests, uh, so of the chinese, although
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:04.920]   It in most cases, I think the way to do it responsibly is somewhere where it won't impact people in space
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.240]   um, there will be uh
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:16.520]   A potential collision risk to most satellites in low earth orbit from the fragmentation of cosmos 14
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:19.240]   O8 over the next few years two decades
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.920]   According to leo labs of private space tracking company
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.920]   There's even some evidence that russia did this
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:38.120]   To attract the attention for their space program, which hasn't been going very well lately. I don't know here's a here's a visualization of the near miss
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:43.640]   Uh, there's the cosmos 1408 the debris. There's the international space station
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:50.440]   Wow, yeah, um, they sheltered in their uh capsules for uh, uh, uh,
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:53.320]   While I don't remember how long an hour or so and then we're able to go back
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:57.800]   Into the space station. Here's the asad explosion. There's the debris field
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:01.400]   Nice. Yeah, that's pleasant boy
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:06.920]   Is this uh, is this a potential new market for companies to go up there and clean up space?
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:10.520]   So we were talking about that too and apparently there are a number of companies
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.080]   There's a japanese company
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.840]   among others who are
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:19.560]   Try doing space cleanup stuff. They're trying all sorts of different technologies magnets
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.240]   um
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:23.240]   nets
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:29.240]   As a star trek fan. I hope this is where we start creating the deflector dish. This is the reason for it
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:31.720]   You're gonna need it. You're gonna need it. Yeah
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:38.600]   Uh, you know, uh, just one of those things could destroy the space station literally vaporize it as you know if you ever saw
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.320]   Sandra Bullock flying through the air and gravity
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.080]   um
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.280]   Actually, uh, broad was telling me around pile our space guy was telling me that
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:49.480]   uh, the uh space stations
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:54.680]   Uh, one of the windows was damaged. It's like a 14 layer window
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:59.720]   Was it the shuttle with one of the one of the windows was damaged by a paint chip
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:06.200]   Whoa paint chip that was coming out at 1500 miles an hour. So, um
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.120]   Chris Hadfield says more regulations are needed to protect
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.120]   astronauts
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.120]   from space debris. He's uh
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:20.520]   He was the first commander of the international space station. He said that you know, we're prepared for this. We're trained for it
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.520]   It does happen
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.800]   But there's really no
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:28.840]   Russia's like say they denied even doing this so like what regulation you do
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:33.400]   Well, the sad thing is that there were cosmon there were rushing cosmonauts in the space station
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:41.000]   Uh secretary of state uh blinkin accused russia of launching the mission in a reckless and irresponsible strike
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:48.280]   Um, you know there was some upset overall of this and yet, you know, it is it is always going to be
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.920]   a potential problem
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:50.920]   um
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:58.840]   I don't know what the answer is. Yeah, and we're sending more stuff all the time and of course
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.120]   The other thing ryan i talked about is the kessler syndrome
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:05.000]   Uh, which is
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.160]   Probably not likely space is a big place even though there's lots of debris up there
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.320]   Uh, the space station can maneuver
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:18.680]   But should you have a chain reaction of debris hitting debris creating more debris and then that debris hitting and more debris
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.920]   the kessler syndrome actually
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.400]   At the end of it. It's it's a chain reaction that you could actually blot the sun out
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:33.000]   Because of all this debris. So I don't know. I don't want to scare anybody something something a little uh, a little nerve
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.160]   I mean that is the definition of in space. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah as a paint chip hits your wind. Yeah
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.480]   Terrifying
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:43.960]   One of my fraternity brothers. Hi, Dave
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:49.000]   Uh, he does track debris of space debris and he says there's so much of it
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.160]   And the hardest part of it is that you can only
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.600]   Track debris of a certain size once it gets smaller
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:59.400]   It's almost like invisible to any tracking system that we have with current technology
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:05.560]   So all the smaller debris is more dangerous than some of the bigger one because you can track that and you can like maneuver like
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:10.840]   Fire thrusters get around it. It's all these tiny little bits that are like little bullets just
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:14.200]   Flying through the space and can cause a lot of damage
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.840]   Elizabeth Holmes on trial the theranos trial continues
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:24.920]   See if I were down where you are chris. I might be going to that and sitting in the trial. I like watching trials
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.920]   uh, Elizabeth Holmes took the stand this week
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:31.000]   and uh
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.360]   According to the verge Elizabeth lapado
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.720]   Took that opportunity to lie through her teeth to the jury
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:47.080]   Uh, fortune, uh, roger parlof a fortune actually made some recordings in the recordings
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:52.360]   home prylov writes at homes claimed that theranos worked with the military
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:59.640]   Was currently working with pharmaceutical companies were at the time that the company could do more than a thousand tests on its proprietary machines
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.800]   And the results were at the highest level of quality
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:06.920]   None of this was true
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.080]   Now was was Elizabeth writing a new story or is this an analysis?
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.240]   Um
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.400]   Because it sounds like she's making a judgment in that
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.000]   Yeah, but if it's not true, it's not true. Right? Well, I
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.040]   I know but she got a real wait a minute. Uh, let's see here
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:31.240]   Okay, so i'm i'm confusing this this wasn't a homes on the stand. This was Holmes talking
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.400]   to a fortune author back in 2014
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.800]   So it's not illegal obviously to lie to a reporter
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:42.600]   And it happens all the time
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:50.120]   Uh, but uh now the uh 10 hours of tape conversations have been introduced into the trial
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.760]   I think homes is
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:55.720]   Expected to testify. Isn't she gonna take the seasons?
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:59.000]   She's in what they call deep doo. I'm afraid
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:02.600]   I don't think it's going well for her. No
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.440]   Um, no, I've got evidence. That's that's
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:09.960]   If the evidence is not what you're talking about
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:14.760]   Um, that's not good for you. Not good
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:17.560]   so
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:18.840]   uh
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.840]   Pearl of her rights
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:23.960]   It was or lapado rights. It was remarkable
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:27.160]   to hear uh
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.680]   The recordings of homes lying in her own voice
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:35.800]   We've heard now in the trial from multiple investors about what she told them. It's been consistent
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:41.160]   The platform could basically do anything farm accompanies had validated it had been used in the battlefield
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.480]   But those rvest investors did not record as the Forbes
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.320]   Uh reporter did was it in her own voice? I mean
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.480]   Was it in her own? No, no, she talked like that didn't she
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:57.880]   Uh, anyway, uh, the trial goes on
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.440]   uh, interesting
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:04.920]   Tesla has ranked dead last on consumer reports reliability list
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:12.280]   Almost dead last almost dead last what's last? Um 27th out of 28 only
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:14.760]   Lincoln
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.640]   Ford's luxury brand, uh comes out worse
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:22.920]   Most of it has to do with the overall instability of electric vehicles in general s uv's
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:30.600]   Which consumer reports jake fisher said during a presentation of the absolute bottom in terms of reliability that surprises me actually
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:34.920]   My experience with electric vehicles is they're more reliable. There are certainly a lot simpler
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.680]   Uh, then, uh, ice vehicles
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:44.040]   You don't have to go to oil changes or anything like that. Yeah, uh, may the virtually zero maintenance
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:49.800]   Um, consumer reports surveys owners of vehicles in fact i get that survey every year as a member
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.040]   1000 vehicles for model year 20 2000 to 2021
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:44:01.000]   Uh, they use that data make predictions about models and their reliability history battery powered electric vehicles
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:07.240]   A bigger segment of this list this year than ever before and their reliability ratings varied widely
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:15.320]   But gas electric hybrids among the most reliable vehicles, uh overall possibly because many of these electric vehicles are new to the market, right?
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:23.480]   So, you know, yeah, I think I think they're new to the market and also, um a lot of the build processes for for building them are still sort of
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:31.480]   You know halfway sort of still in beta. I mean, there's quite a lot of um if you if you spend a lot of time on on car tik chok
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:33.800]   As I do
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.000]   um car talk
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000]   Um, because i'm down with the kids like that
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.680]   um, you see a lot of um, you know people taking deliveries of their first haslers
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:50.520]   And you know the plastics inside are moving around and the headlamps are fogging up. Yeah, and you know, um
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.240]   You know, if you put a ding in one of your doors
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:58.120]   It's a six month back order to get a new door because you can't just beat it out like a normal panel
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:01.320]   So I think that it feels a lot like tesla is
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:06.040]   Doing a very good job of of getting more cars out in the market quickly
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:12.200]   But that the build quality is sort of is slightly lacking as they continue to refine those processes
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:16.120]   Yeah, I mean we've got to think that you know ice vehicles have been being built for you know
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:21.240]   A hundred years at this point and tesla's been building cars for what ten maybe yeah
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:26.760]   Well, not just that they're notorious for inserting new parts in the middle of a stream
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:33.480]   So they get an upgraded steering wheel or button or whatever and they'll just put it in the line instead of sticking with the same
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:41.560]   Formula yeah for the like model year of the vehicle and so they'll throw that in but I love hearing well that you're into ctt which is great
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.040]   Carta
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:45.640]   Cartik talk
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:51.080]   Jake Fisher senior between that and the terror and and a lot of um a lot of air fryer recipes
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:54.120]   Cars and air fries have become my tik tok algorithm
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:56.440]   air fry
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:03.400]   See I am on the kitchen confidential subreddit in which they mock air fryers is being convection ovens with an extra fan
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:04.520]   So
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:10.760]   You know, you just there's a battle now going on in social media jake fisher senior director of auto testing and consumer reports
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:16.840]   Said there's electric drivetrains aren't so much the problem. He told cnbc
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.200]   uh
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.440]   unnecessary high tech bells and whistles
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:24.760]   Are the things that that that seemed to fail a lot
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.880]   um
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:33.560]   How about software software performance on these because they're constantly being updated right
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.120]   But i'm just wondering if if they're you know
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:42.440]   About bugs and stuff in your software. I owned a tesla model x it was very early in the production run
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:46.200]   It was very it was fine. There were a couple of reliability issues, but nothing
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:49.800]   Spectact note nothing worse than any other vehicle and I love my tesla
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:53.320]   But it was stories like this that made me think maybe I shouldn't buy another
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:58.680]   Tesla I ended up getting a Ford maki electric vehicle and that's apparently kind of in the middle of the
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.440]   reliability
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:03.720]   Band although I think it's early. It's only been out for less than a year
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:06.200]   um
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:09.320]   Consumer reports said commonly reported issues from
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:16.200]   The new model y owners include defective sensors that had to be replaced problems with heat bumps air conditioning body panels
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.120]   It didn't line up. That's been a consistent problem
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:23.080]   A fit and finish for a tesla for a long time water leaks and the trunk due to missing seals
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:27.400]   We didn't have that problem because I had the falcon wing doors at least I hated that car by the way
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:31.320]   She but the other reason I buy another tesla is least I said like over mine did body
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:37.320]   But the the they had the falcon wing doors and you never wanted to open them in the rain because it was designed in such a way that
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:42.120]   The rain would collect at the top of the door and when you open it up, it would just water fall in it was great
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:45.720]   It was just it was just bad design, you know
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:53.640]   Owners reported a variety of electrical and hardware issues with a higher price and less popular model s and model x falcon wing
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.160]   older models fair better and reliability because
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:00.280]   companies tweak and redesigns solve problems
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.080]   But tesla deviates from this approach
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.880]   This is what you were saying
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:10.680]   This is fish you're talking at almost random times during the year tesla will switch major components
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:17.000]   Suppliers or sensors and other units the more you change the greater chances you're going to have some problems
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:24.120]   Absolutely, that's why i've heard as the great marcelle pruss said la plous a challenge the greater the chances you're going to have some problems
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:27.000]   Uh, that makes that makes a lot of sense
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.480]   That was exactly what he said
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.080]   Exactly right. Uh-huh the more you change in the middle of a model
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.800]   You're the more likely rocks get built reliability issues
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.560]   I didn't get any of this public school education, but I know my pruss
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:45.400]   Is black friday coming up are you all excited?
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:51.880]   That's today today's black friday. I remember i'm old enough to remember when black friday was on friday was on friday
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:58.200]   Remember like people would line up in front of target and then kill each other trying to get to the cheap tv
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:04.360]   But that I don't think that happens now you buy online right that's right. You don't see the lines anymore as much
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:09.320]   You might see it in summer, you know far out far flung areas you might but not not in the city
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.960]   And remember uh, they they called it cyber monday because people waited
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:18.440]   They wouldn't buy on friday. They would wait till they get back to the fast internet at work
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.840]   To go online and buy
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:26.040]   Don't have to do that. No, in fact the internet work usually isn't as fast as the internet home these days
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:31.560]   And friday has expanded to november black friday is black november now. I think
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:37.240]   Well google has uh, it's deals uh apple has some deals amazon has some deals
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:42.680]   But you probably aren't going to want to go to the wire cutter to find out what to buy or not buy
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.240]   because
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:49.000]   The wire cutter's employees are threatening a black friday
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.880]   strike
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.280]   Treat your employees like people. Yeah wire cutter is owned by the new york times
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:58.840]   They say we make a lot of money
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.400]   For the new york times
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:06.520]   After two years of bargaining the times companies continue to layer negotiations. This is i'm quoting
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:13.320]   Wire cutter union.com through unfair labor practices and wage offers that are significantly underpay our staff
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.480]   i'm sympathetic. I love the wire cutter
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.520]   Uh, and if they're not getting what they deserve
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:23.480]   Black friday is a nightmare for anybody working on tech blogs, especially the wire cutter
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:28.440]   The two worst days of the year for wire cut employees are at prime day
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:32.680]   And black friday because they they constantly update the blog
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:37.560]   Like for 24 hours with the best deals and deals not to get and so forth
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:42.280]   Our staff works around the clock the union says during the black friday shopping week
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:47.080]   Our busiest and most profitable time of year putting extra hours in over the holidays to serve our readers
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:50.360]   Our labor continues to bring in record revenue for the times
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.360]   And help to grow the wire cutter by 10 000 subscribers in the past quarter
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:51:00.840]   Now they're saying to everybody if we do not reach a deal by black friday do not cross the picket line
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:06.360]   Do not shop through wire cutter on black friday through cyber monday. Let me guess
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:09.720]   Let me guess i'm thinking as as the um
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:14.760]   As the autocrat in the group will hear us that you're not a fan of labor unions
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:19.160]   That's absolutely outrageous
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:21.880]   Okay
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:30.120]   Somebody bring there's a big entrepreneur union which has some of the strongest so um some of the strongest labor
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:32.600]   Teasing you
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:35.000]   So as somebody who uh, you know
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.200]   The son of a teacher who is um, you know if you're not in a teachers union over here you're you're
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:43.080]   um, not a great place to be and as somebody who
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:49.000]   Works in a building full with full of journalists that are in the national union of journalists
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:56.040]   Um, which provides very important, you know legal protections and and rights for the journalist working in the area
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:59.560]   I'm extremely important to do. I think where
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:02.280]   um, I slightly
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:06.520]   Not that I lack sympathy, but where I take issue slightly with the
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.400]   um
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:13.880]   With some of the rhetoric that the wire cutter guys have deployed is sort of well the new york times has got x amount of
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:21.000]   Cash in its cash reserves and we're only asking for for one percent of that as rises. I think it's very difficult to sort of
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.440]   Uh draw a direct line between a company's cash reserves and what it should be, you know
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:29.720]   Paying people otherwise apple, you know, everybody that worked at apple would be on
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:35.640]   You know 20 million a year and you wouldn't even touch apples cash reserves. I think there's a difference between
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:42.280]   Um, you know the new york times as a whole is obviously, you know coming back stronger and is is doing well
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:47.160]   But I think you can't necessarily draw a straight line between that and
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.560]   Exactly what people should be being paid
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.280]   But if you know if they're not being paid fairly and of course they should be
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:57.800]   entitled to take action and I think the fact that you know, obviously they're based in New York which has got some of the
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:04.440]   Some of the better labor practices the times itself is unionized. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so is the journal the post
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:07.800]   Reuters the associated press or I mean, it's not unusual
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:12.200]   It is unusual the tech industry though the tech industry is is kind of a hereditary
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:17.800]   Aversion to unions. We need a tech journalist's union. We need to start right away. I agree chris
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:24.200]   I'm actually a proud union member. I'm a member of after sag because I uh, i've done a radio show for many years and
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.520]   Uh, I i'm i'm a i'm a all-in-favor of unions
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:32.040]   But uh, I know not all of my colleagues working in the
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:36.200]   The tech journalism sector think it's a good idea. What how do you feel about it chris?
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:42.760]   Well, well, I mean for most people some people it would be good for a person like me though. I have my own business now so
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:48.120]   Um, and i'm contributing to a couple different publications and I I ghost right for other
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:55.320]   Organizations and i'm ghost editing for a large social network. Did you get hurt by uh, sp8?
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:59.720]   the um, the uh, was that that was sp8 the uh,
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.400]   California
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.400]   independent contractors
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:10.200]   No, I know a lot of people and prove driver one of them who lost in effect lost his contract
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:18.360]   Reporting gig because it would have been an owner as burden for uh, tech republic to uh to keep him on as a contractor
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:23.560]   Okay, I know it hasn't affected me. So it hasn't okay. They're all so
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:31.240]   tech republic tech republic by the way was just sold by uh red ventures which now owns zd net wait a minute red ventures sold tech republic
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:36.040]   Yeah to um for my understand to uh technology advice my old publisher
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:40.040]   Oh my goodness. I think this has happened a couple weeks ago
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:47.160]   So tech red ventures bought bought most of zd right yes zd net cnet z
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:51.800]   Yes cnet cbs interactive. Yes cbs interactive
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:57.400]   Uh, some others too. There's a button for operating. So did they sell off just tech republic or
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:04.840]   Uh, that's to my knowledge. Yes. I don't know if we sold a new yet technology advice
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:11.480]   Yeah, a berry media company. Huh private privately held there eight years nine years old
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:17.480]   They're in Nashville, Tennessee of all places. Well tech republics in Louisville. So yeah, that makes sense
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.560]   Maybe that makes sense from that
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.480]   Uh, on the other card. Yeah, uh, I worked for a year with them
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:30.200]   Well, we have lots of friends uh work at tech republic including the editor in chief who's been on this show was just on the show a few weeks ago
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:34.520]   Wow, uh, there's a bit of a shocker. Well, I
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:42.440]   You know, it's it's there's been a lot of turmoil thanks to the internet and the tech publications and I think that's one of the reasons
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:49.320]   Uh, these companies are reluctant to unionize. It's not a predictable business and it's been an impact of money loser
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:51.880]   For a lot of them
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:54.200]   Yeah, yeah, it has it has been. Yeah
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:56:01.480]   I think it's very easy, um, you know to look at the good times and and want to cash in but it's also a you know
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:08.600]   Goodness knows how much the new york times has has lost and invested over a very long period of time to get to where it is now
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:10.600]   I suspect that was it might be
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.800]   profitable in that area now. I suspect there's a net enterprise over the last 15 years
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:21.720]   That's still pretty heavily in the red. Yeah, well, that's exactly right and that's exactly why you can't say
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:28.520]   Well, look at your cash holdings. It took a it was it was nip and tuck for a while for all all newspapers
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:33.880]   But the times is okay, fuse the handful of success stories. Yeah leo. I just looked this up
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:36.680]   technology advice bought
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:38.760]   uh tech republic
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:43.480]   Actually, it was announced on in august so it's been a little while I wasn't paying attention
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.360]   And it was 23 mill what they bought good
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.440]   Good
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:52.440]   Well, that's that's a decent amount of enough money. They don't want to keep it going. Let's put it that way
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:57.320]   No, absolutely. They should invest in yeah. Yeah. Yeah more coming up in just a little bit
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:56:59.720]   We got to take a little break before we do though. I do want to

[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:39.160]   There is absolutely no reason this shouldn't be looked up by regulators
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:41.320]   There is no rational justification
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:46.200]   Other than we're looking to eat every penny we can out of everyone who uses this product
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.840]   And we don't care if we do it through malicious means

[01:58:54.920 --> 01:59:00.360]   Investing in creators and maybe we can get them to give us a little I don't know. It's just worth a try
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:02.440]   So that's coming up meanwhile

[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:13.880]   um
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:19.080]   So leo can I jump in with a story story of the week we'll hear us we take and suggestions. Yes
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:26.040]   So as somebody um who finally this week managed to get their hands on a on an xbox series x what
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:33.400]   It seems apt to um to remember that this week is 20 years since the launch of the original xbox
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:39.560]   Oh never forget which yeah, which I remember having the enormous controller in the uh
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:44.440]   And so this week is uh, so it's you know the launch of um halo
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:49.320]   Infinite. Yeah, which is our forza is going great guns
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:53.160]   Um, and it's it's you know, it's remarkable to think that
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:03:00.520]   You know looking back 20 years ago everyone thought that that microsoft were completely bonkers for for launching into that market
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:03.400]   I have to play
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.800]   The bill gates meets the rock xbox launch
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:16.280]   Yes, this was before the rock was you know, it was the raw famous movie star
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:22.600]   Soon to be presidential candidate. This was when the rock was merely a well-known wrestler
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:26.920]   Mm-hmm. This is the product that will be out later this year
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:32.360]   Uh, and there's an amazing amount going on working with so nerdy
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:40.360]   Where i work with a developer working with the retailers the program around this thing is really quite phenomenal
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:45.960]   But the box itself, uh is another thing that we put a lot of energy into so
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:49.320]   You made it one way. Oh my god. Here he is. There's a device plus here
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:52.920]   A lot of energy into it. No wonder because it was so bloody enormous
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:56.120]   I'm gonna be now unveil xbox
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.280]   Oh
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:01.480]   No, but a pause from the non-journalists in the audience
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:07.400]   Uh, most journalists just sitting there going wow, that's that's look at the size of that controller
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:11.560]   Here's got here. He's got here on his head. Here's the rock
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:15.480]   That's fascinating
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:22.040]   I really think that the only reason they brought the rock into this presentation is because he's the only person who's
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:25.160]   Hanner's with make that controller look like a regular song also
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.400]   For instance, I know that you're a five time
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:34.280]   WWF champion not to mention one of the top entertainers in the world
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.520]   Bill and very flattered. I'm a big fan of yours as well
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:43.800]   For instance, the rock knows you the chairman and chief software architect of the microsoft corporation
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.080]   Leading worldwide provider software for the personal computer
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:55.880]   Thank you rock. I'm I'm very flattered myself by creating windows by creating windows in 1983
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:05:04.200]   multitasking graphical user interface environment that runs on ms doss based computers along with windows nt and windows
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:08.680]   And completely self-contained operating systems that feature networking
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:18.440]   Symmetric multi processing multi threading and security bill you certainly revolutionize the technology we know today
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:27.080]   I mean the rock doesn't impress easily bill, you know that but i'm pretty damn impressed with what we're seeing here today
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:33.720]   And considering that this xbox at this moment is only running on one fifth of the system's power is very impressive
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:40.280]   Bill do you have any idea what the rock would be like if he won't only running on one fifth of his power
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:47.000]   Well, I I would think it doesn't matter what you think bill that right there's why the rock gets the big money
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.480]   Yeah, he could tell the world's richest man. It doesn't matter
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:57.480]   What you think anyway, I won't play anymore of this. It's always painful these corporate things. I don't know why anybody
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:00.200]   thinks this is a good idea to bring in
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:04.840]   Some big names I think there are probably a few million very good ideas that
[02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:10.600]   So happy 20th to xbox i'm
[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:14.680]   You still can't i'm stunned that you don't get a zex
[02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:19.480]   Uh, I I had to resort to I do you know what I had to sell
[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:22.360]   Yourself sexually to get this
[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:29.320]   It came close it came close sadly nobody that I knew that had an xbox series x was interested in
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:33.880]   Tried so it was so it was a stellar company like that was part of the company
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:35.480]   Yeah dmg
[02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:41.560]   I want 40 million dollars and an xbox series x and an xbox series x no, n well, sorry. We can't do the series
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:45.800]   Exactly impossible
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:51.080]   Impossible I went I went I went to ebay and paid the scalpers tax, but I had to do shame on you
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:53.160]   How much did you have to pay for it? How much?
[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:58.680]   Uh, so I think over here they retail for 4 9 9. Yeah, and I paid
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:01.240]   629 I think that's not bad
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:09.080]   It's not bad to have to have one now because I had to have forza or everyone that I know it's people are raving over this new forza
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:10.360]   It's the hottest came out right now. It's
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:13.640]   Do you know what's really interesting about it is um
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:18.520]   It's it's it's the first thing that I've seen that has done what what I call
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:25.400]   Non-contemporaneous multiplayer and I don't know whether that's a real phrase whether i'm just making that up. That's all right
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:29.480]   It's yours now, baby. You own it as your but I love the fact that you know
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:34.280]   I don't often have time to go online and actually play at like a schedule time with my friends
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:36.120]   You know actually like keeping a work
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:40.600]   You know we've all work schedules and families and it's impossible to get online and actually play at the same time
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:42.840]   But as I'm racing around on my own
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:48.280]   It keeps pushing you like other people's records and your friend you have like ghost cars that you can follow
[02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:54.040]   So I'll be driving a bit of road and it'd be like hey, you know your friend drove this bit of road like 10 seconds quick
[02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:56.520]   And you just didn't you're like screw that guy
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:59.720]   Straight back again. I'm gonna do it
[02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:06.840]   And so you end up with with a really interesting like competitive multiplayer where you actually don't have to play at the same time
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:11.640]   Really guys. It's it's really nice in the world of you know not to get to macro or depressing
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:17.240]   But in a sort of covid world where you probably don't see your friends quite as much as you'd like to it's a nice little bit extra connection
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:20.920]   Well, yeah, and you're late and you're you know kind of lonely sweat filled box
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:23.560]   You know you get to
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:25.560]   10 years
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:30.280]   Single-huffled yeah, I've got friends. Yeah, look I can see them
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:35.400]   Beating me on the screen. I can see them ghosting. I mean literally is a whole new definition of being ghosted
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:44.440]   No, I think that's great. I wish I could get a series x I I've been trying since it came out and actually now microsoft saying 2023 probably
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:46.840]   before this uh supply chain
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:49.480]   nightmare ends
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:55.160]   Happy anniversary 20 years for xbox. How about you wesley? Was there a story? I missed that you wanted to talk about
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:02.600]   Yes, um, I logged on to my twitter blue and went into new stories
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:05.720]   Twitter blue are you my top artimals
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:14.680]   And I saw facebook's waistblind policies around hate speech came at the expense of black users new documents show
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:16.760]   how could that be
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:24.840]   And what the reason why I'm pointing this one out specifically is because there was another story in the rundown about their glove
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:27.880]   Where you allow you can touch the metaverse. Yeah, um
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:35.000]   It this just really shows how they're not putting people first in anything they approach
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:42.360]   and um the the type of arguments that they are that they expose is in the board room about
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:51.720]   Oh, well if we actually made things equitable for people who are marginalized our conservative groups will get angry because uh, we will have to start
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.480]   um
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:59.880]   flagging some of the stuff that they post um and so it's it's it's kind of like shown that it's it's really like
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:07.320]   In the company their motto shouldn't be moved fast and break things. It should be simply profits over anything else
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:09.880]   Anything else am I getting the way this is the story?
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:16.680]   Elizabeth dwaskin from the washington post facebook's race blind policies around hate speech came at the expense
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:24.920]   Of black users new documents show researchers proposed a fix to the biased algorithm, but one internal document predicted pushback
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:26.280]   from
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:27.240]   conservative
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:32.120]   Part and I think there were even some stories some stories in there that um some of the people
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:36.760]   Specifically tasked with working on this internally at facebook had documents withheld from them
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:40.920]   To prevent them sort of sounding off for doing anything about it, which is yeah
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:45.080]   Great luck when you're withholding research from your own employees, but it's on brand
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:47.640]   It's on brand can't deny that
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:52.280]   And so when they came up with this glove for meta um to go back to that story
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:11:01.320]   What if facebook really listened to all the outcry they would the first thing they would say about the glove is this is what we're doing for privacy protection
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:07.400]   This is what we're doing to make sure that the the use of the glove won't adversely hurt health or
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:11.640]   This is what we're doing to make sure that it it enriches lives. They don't do that
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:15.400]   Um, they're still talking about how cool it is to fill a plane plate or whatever
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:21.080]   Yeah, so it's not in their dna to have a people's first approach to technology
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:26.600]   Uh and in meta everyone's black. How about that? What if we just do that make everybody black
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:34.120]   Yeah, yeah, no, by the way, I'm not wearing this glove. Uh, I don't care what they say
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:36.680]   That is that is horrific
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:39.880]   It's a metaverse glove where you
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:47.960]   That's the power. It's like the panos club doesn't it does like you can expect to sort of put some in and sort of
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:53.320]   We used with the same sort of um maliciousness snap your fingers and uh half the world's gone
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:12:00.360]   Okay, good pick. Thank you wesley. Um your turn chris anything I missed in the uh rundown
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:04.680]   There were a lot of good stories or not in the rundown for them. Oh, there's always a lot of good stories
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:07.800]   But I found one this not as razzle dazzle as the rock or
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:14.520]   Quite as contraver kind of controversial as facebook, but I came across a new company called flyfin that just
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:18.280]   Uh launched about a week ago a little over a week ago
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:24.120]   And you know, we've got holidays coming up and we're spending lots of money and on black friday and black
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:25.800]   black month
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:28.360]   Um, and uh, we're gonna have to eventually
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:31.240]   Look at the look at our taxes at the end of the year
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:39.000]   And this is not as exciting as those other stories, but it's important flyfin offers is a ai bass based
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:45.560]   Tax app that's aimed at freelancers and gig workers mostly but anybody can use it and what it does
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:49.240]   Is it it's in the background working all the time?
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:53.960]   For whenever you do a financial transaction of any kind
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.240]   It keeps track of all your tax liability all your tax
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:01.240]   credits
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:06.200]   And it's it's spinning around it's always working for you and you can start it right away and get caught up
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:13.240]   It'll go back in to the past year. So it's like me or uh something you link your accounts in and then it goes through all of those
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:16.600]   Interesting it does and then at the end of the year
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:21.960]   Ostensibly you push a button and everything's totaled up and then you have time to
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:24.760]   Uh use one of their their actual
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:33.560]   Humanoid or humans to help you to be sure that everything lines up correctly and is legal and then there's no
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:39.800]   No problems with your return, but you can have your return done. Uh, you know, I generally first it says
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:42.600]   January first
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:46.520]   So the idea of having this always running in the background. I love that idea
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:54.120]   Of her, you know, I'm thinking answers. See I have lisa. So I don't have she's she's watching every every penny I spend
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:14:00.520]   Okay, you gotta you gotta person. I have I have real intelligence is not artificial, but what's really you're right. It's very interesting because
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.440]   uh
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:07.880]   It kind of it's a it's a statement about our tax policy in this country that it's so complicated
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:11.560]   That you need our official intelligence to figure out
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.200]   To maximize your deductions. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:23.720]   Do you in in England? Do you uh will have to does inland? I know there's some countries where you get a postcard saying we think your taxes is
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:24.760]   Okay
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:28.360]   Do you have to go through the same rigor role with inland revenue that we have to go into us?
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:35.160]   It's it's almost it's almost for every for 95 of the population I would say it's incredibly simplified
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.560]   So your tax just comes off when you get your paycheck at the end of the month and
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:42.600]   So I have to fill out a tax form in your life
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:47.640]   There is a there are a small percentage of people's every example if you're a if you're a company director
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:52.680]   Or if you're self-employed you will have to fill out a form but in each case
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:15:00.680]   Generally generally the government will lead you through a form pretty simply. It's all completeable online. You don't need any third party software
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:07.800]   Um, you don't that's another scandal in this country because I mean the the fact that is it into it that has like just a lovely
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:12.120]   monopoly yeah, they hide the free form and they lobbied for a long time
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:16.760]   To keep the us government from offering free filing because they make so much money on turbo tax
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:23.400]   Yeah, so it's it's it's really it's i'm not going to say that if you have to if you have to fill a tax return out in the uk
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:29.800]   You know, it's not trivial, but it also, you know, you don't require artificial intelligence to do it
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:34.200]   I mean chances are if you're clever enough to be running your own business as a freelancer
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:40.040]   You can manage to do your in tax without ai but for 95 percent of population you've never got to touch it. It's um
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.120]   It's it's one of the things one of the few things that we get right
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:52.440]   In portugal ifil says we have automated taxes a lot of countries do this you just confirm the value you said that's right and you're done
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:16:00.440]   You can dispute it if you want but because it's all done automatically. It's almost always exactly if only if only we could be so automated here in the states
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:02.840]   Well, I'll tell you wow
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:05.000]   uh

[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:17.400]   Thank you. Oh, yes. Great to see you. Thank you, chris
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:24.120]   Thank you wesley. What a great panel always fun to get together with new and old friends and talk about
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:29.240]   tech we do a twit on uh sunday afternoons round 230 pacific 530 eastern
[02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:32.280]   230 utc because yes, finally
[02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:35.720]   We finally followed the rest of the world and set our clocks back an hour
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:40.520]   230 is the starting time and I mentioned that because you can watch us record the show
[02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:44.040]   Uh, most people watch on demand, but if you would like to watch live
[02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:46.520]   Tune in at that time to go to twit
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:53.160]   Actually live dot twit.tv is the website and that'll give you a chance to choose between live audio or video of the show
[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:57.000]   People who watch live often like to chat live there two places you can do that irc
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.280]   Dot twit.tv open to all and of course our
[02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:03.640]   fabulous club twit members they have access to
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:09.720]   A discord server, which has been really fun. I think the surprise benefit
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:13.800]   Of club twit membership is the chance to interact with all of our hosts
[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:19.640]   We had a book group on friday with stacy. Oh, I had a fill-in overflow room so many people joined
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:24.200]   Thank you that went so well and I presume that's going to be on the twit plus feed right
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:28.040]   That's a special it's already is that's a special feed for club twit members
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:33.160]   The final benefit we thought it was going to be the primary benefit add free versions of all the shows
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:35.240]   But the discord's great
[02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:38.760]   The twit plus feed has lots of extra stuff that doesn't make it to the podcast
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:43.320]   And all of that seven bucks a month go to twit dot tv slash club twit
[02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:48.200]   If you'd like to find out more this would be good to sign up because I have a feeling there's some great events coming up
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:50.680]   in the near future
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:54.360]   Uh, let's see what else on demand versions of the show all of our shows
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:23:01.240]   Still available for free, you know add supported at the website twit.tv go to twit.tv
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:08.200]   Uh and download this show or any of our shows you could also go to the youtube channels each show has its own youtube channel
[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:11.080]   Uh, I think it's youtube.com slash this week in tech
[02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:15.400]   Uh youtube.com slash twit is another place you could go to get twit bits
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:18.760]   Uh little stuff and also links to all of the youtube channels
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:24.440]   Finally probably the best way to get it subscribe to uh twit in your favorite podcast player
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:26.520]   If you search for twit you'll find all of our shows
[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:31.880]   And if you do me a favor if your podcast player allows for reviews as many do
[02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:36.600]   Leave us a five star review. I know we've been around since 2005, but there's still some
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:42.440]   People youngins who've never heard a twit let them know what a great show it is. We always have so much fun
[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:46.520]   Thank you all for being here and we will see you next time another twit
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:49.400]   Is in the can. Bye. Bye
[02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:52.600]   Do the twit do the twit all right
