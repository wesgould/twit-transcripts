[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   I'm excited to talk tech with someone I've watched since the tech TV days.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   This is a big moment for me.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   And your webcomic Extra Life has been around since...
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   2001, June of 2001 started the comic and the shows started rolling in around 2003, 2004.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   And most recent was App Slappy, show for App Store lovers and iPhone, iPhone, iPhone,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   iPhone Honors.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   iPhone Honors, iPhone freaks out there.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   They just can't get enough of the App Store.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   I started that a couple of weeks ago and that's doing well.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   I did Scott and Tom Aaron have a new podcast called, I'm sorry, called Forecast, F-O-U-R, Cast.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   And I did that last week and had such a good time.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   And I thought, "Well, I should get Scott on the show."
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   And then he said, "Well, if I come on the show, you better bring Miss Veronica Belmont on the show."
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   Okay.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   We're all friends.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   I just love Veronica.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   She's the greatest.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   She's like the weird little sister I never had.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   Veronica, is Scott our Guild Master?
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   Should I be bowing down to him?
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   He's over there.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   Randy is really our boss guy in the Guild.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   But yeah, Scott's up there too.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   With a heart!
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   Veronica and I were there the day we founded it.

[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   Correct.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   You should be in there.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   You should be in there, Leo.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   What do you mean?
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   I should be in there.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   I'm on the rolls, dude.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   I just don't play this silly thing.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   You know why?
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   My life's worked.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   Every time I watch Warcraft, World of Warcraft now, it says, "Check back at five days.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   We'll be updating."
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   If you don't update like every time, you pay the price.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   It takes a lot more.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   It'll be pretty bad.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   And now they're using peer-to-peer.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   So it's even slower than before.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   Well, the way that I met Scott was through Buzz Out Loud, actually.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   He was a listener and called in all the time with really great comments.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   And then I think one time he mentioned that he had a World of Warcraft podcast.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   So I started listening to that and then we became buds.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   Great, great show.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   Well, speaking of buds from Buzz Out Loud, ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Molly Wood is also here.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   Hello.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   It's so nice to be here.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   A lumb from Buzz Out Loud.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   I know.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   I didn't understand a word of what was just said because I didn't go the wow route.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   But the Buzz Out Loud, they...
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   I got two words from Molly.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   Bullet bourbon, baby.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   Oh, I hope that's not still the first bottle.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   I'm almost out.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   It's still the first bottle.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   No, what do you think I am?
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   A lush?
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   Molly brought me this last time she was in studio.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   It is good stuff.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   You fueled your guest appearance on forecast without a fire.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   Absolutely.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   I discovered that it goes very well with Odwalla Lemonade.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   That's funny because I was also drunk.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   I did forecast.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   Were you?
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   I think that was the inspiration.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   You're glad to have wine.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   You should know that for today I have a nice summer Lombusco, which is sort of like a fizzy red wine.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   It's really quite lovely.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   How delicious.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   Yes.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   It's my goal to do Twit with some sort of liquor all the time.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   Also, it's hotter than blazes, so we need whatever we do.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   It is.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   Molly's out on the deck of her lovely palatial estate in the Oakland Berkeley Hills.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   She actually owns the Oakland Berkeley Hills.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   That's true, the whole thing.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   The view is spectacular.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   It is spectacular.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   Let's get to the stories.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   The big story, of course, was the Thursday meltdown that everybody experienced when Twitter was
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   not online Thursday morning.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   Kind of an interesting story.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   It turns out that it wasn't an attack on Twitter.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.000]   It was an attack on one Twitter user and not just on his Twitter account, but on his Facebook
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.800]   account, on his YouTube, on his live journal.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   He's a Georgian blogger.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   I feel like he's a Georgian blogger straight out of the Soviet former Soviet Republic of
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   Germany.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   That's what I call it.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.160]   The DDoS traffic was not coming from Georgia, but from all of the owned computers here in
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.800]   the United States and in China and around the world.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   Facebook had slowness, but Twitter was newt.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   It was absolutely unavailable for days.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   Facebook did seem to, even though it had trouble, it seemed to weather it a little bit better
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   than Twitter.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   They recovered quickly.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   Google, which also was hit, didn't even stumble, didn't even quiver.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   Twitter, yeah.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   Does this say something about Twitter's infrastructure?
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   That's what this serves to do once again.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   It's an attack like this that supposedly on one guy takes down the entire service.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   It's a total wake-up call to Twitter.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   They've got to figure out a way to scale better.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   I know we talked about it, been talked about a billion times on this show alone, but they
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   are not ready for something really, really major for people who really want to take them down.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   Dave Weiner has been saying about this.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   He actually has Dave to come on the show, but he couldn't make it.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   Dave Weiner has been saying this is, Twitter needs to be distributed.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.800]   Twitter needs to be distributed.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   Boy, this points it out.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.080]   What he's wanting saying is there shouldn't be one Twitter, there should be a lot of
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.280]   Twitter's federated together so that one goes down.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.800]   It doesn't mean Twitter goes down.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.280]   Well, he's been saying that for a long time because Twitter just had so many performance
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.240]   issues for so long.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.920]   I think it has got to be frustrating for Twitter because it is a giant setback in that sense.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:20.520]   They barely had recovered from the Oprah onslaught, after which they got embarrassingly slow.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.800]   Then they basically proved that they can't handle a DDoS attack as well as your local
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   bank.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.280]   Yeah, but they're saying even now that they don't even know when things are going to go
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.360]   back to normal again.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.840]   It could be any amount of time.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.880]   The scaling issue is definitely a big deal, but they've done better.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.280]   I mean, they've added tons more servers and the more money they get, the more they build
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.080]   up their infrastructure.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.680]   But I don't think they were expecting this kind of thing, although they probably should
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   have been.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.760]   It's really a matter of time before something like this happens.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.600]   So it really things as people like everybody with their trying to use the API to use their
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.800]   little services, I use TweetReal on my iPhone and they're down for days.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.400]   That's what I haven't heard of before.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   TweetReal is great, isn't it?
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   It doesn't hurt, TweetReal.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   Pretty great app.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.280]   It only does one thing.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   You don't Twitter from it.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.400]   You upload video or pictures from it.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.240]   But you can't, but it's a the Sobsie iPhone problem.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.520]   I don't have a free G.S.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.280]   Well, I think it'll work with, oh, you can't do video, but you could still use their pictures.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   But the problem with video on the iPhone 3GS is that even like a 10 second video, the
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.680]   iPhone says, no, that's too big.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.880]   I won't send it.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   But TweetReal doesn't care.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.320]   So I was TweetRealing from China.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.960]   In fact, when China was blocking Twitter, I was able to use TweetReal to get out, which
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   really really was awesome.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.960]   It's so odd.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.080]   The downtime didn't even affect me for some reason.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.000]   I was shooting all day on Thursday and I kept hearing about all these problems.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.880]   Like I was checking tech meme and everything every so often.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.040]   But I sent out a couple of Twitters.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.240]   I don't know if they made it out there, but I didn't have any actual issues doing anything
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.760]   or reading tweets that whole day.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.360]   So I don't know if I was just in some kind of like safe pocket or if I was just on at
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.360]   the right times.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.280]   But I was like, what's everyone talking about?
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.440]   I don't understand what's going on.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.440]   I know.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.080]   I think you must have been on base for sure because I was going crazy that whole day.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.240]   Like I can't believe how I had to go ghetto with Facebook.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.400]   It was just so depressing.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.600]   Well, as Evil Monkey says in our friend feed room, is Twitter really that important?
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.240]   Well, you know, I think actually, I mean, whether or not it's that important, it certainly
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.560]   is perceived that way because all day long the media was calling CNET for comment.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   You know, there was the number one story on the Times in Newsweek.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.640]   It was the number one story on NPR.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.240]   It's as if, you know, it's as if the Bank of America collapsed or something.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.240]   It was huge.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.240]   It upset your addiction.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   It upset your addiction.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.240]   The infrastructure went down.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   And it's not.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.240]   The telephones are gone.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.120]   I missed the people I follow was my problem.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.080]   So I, as soon as this hit, I was like, wow, it's quiet in Twitter.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   There's something wrong.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.560]   It feels like apocalyptic almost.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   I hated it.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   I felt lonely.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   Really?
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.440]   I was all alone without my peace.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   I didn't like it.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   Wow.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.080]   Twitter really is an addiction.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.080]   It's like Starbucks.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.080]   It really is.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.080]   It's bad.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.080]   It's bad.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.080]   It's a bad addiction.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.360]   And I think it, it's totally bad for, I think a certain, a certain kind of, maybe not
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.080]   a certain kind of person because I don't want to paint myself as some sort of personality
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.360]   brush, but if you have a really good dialogue going with the people that you follow and
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.280]   who follow you, then I think it can be really, it can feel like you're all of a sudden kind
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   of off in the void and none of your friends are calling you right now.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   They say so.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.840]   There's so many other ways to reach out to people.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.800]   I mean, we're all on Facebook and we're all on Friend Feed or at least we should be.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   And so I think there's a lot of different ways to kind of fill that gap if you don't
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   have Twitter for a little while for a day.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   Friend Feed got really busy.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   I live on Friend Feed.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   It got very busy.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   No.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   No, you don't need a replacement?
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   No.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   No.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   Other things.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   I only want Twitter.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   No.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.080]   Were you an early at Twitter adopter, Molly?
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.080]   No, I was late.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.440]   Veronica knows I was pretty late.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.640]   I didn't adopt it until 2007.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.600]   I think it was right around the time I went on maternity leave, like right after I had
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.680]   my son and I had discovered it just shortly before that.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.280]   So maybe February, April 2007.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   According to the-
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.800]   I mean, I guess relatively speaking, but you know, it had been around.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   Kids don't use Twitter.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   Teenagers don't use Twitter.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.760]   Teenagers kind of very, you know, sketchy-leys.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.560]   They like Facebook.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   They like MySpace.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   Younger people don't use it.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.320]   It tends to be professionals in their thirties and later.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   Yes.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.560]   My daughter, my 15-year-old daughter started using it.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.080]   She unfollowed me and I said, "What do you do?"
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.440]   And I asked her that and she said, "Dad, she says you tweet too much."
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.800]   I was like, "Well, crap."
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.600]   I mean, I can't even get my own daughter to call her.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   Your daughter says you tweet too much.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.600]   So that's not a sign of addiction.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   I don't know what it is.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.400]   That's a boring episode right there.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.040]   My mom's on Twitter, but she only follows me and Levar Burton.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   Aw.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   I don't know.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.880]   She just really likes Levar Burton.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   Fathers who tweet too much.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   Who doesn't?
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.200]   And the daughters who love them on the next mori.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   I think it's good.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   I like it.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.760]   I don't want to drive this story into the ground.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.760]   I think we have.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.440]   But I was stunned more by the media reaction to this than the fact that Twitter was down.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.440]   I mean, big deal.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440]   Fail wells were used to that.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   The Twitter level is far out.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.440]   Twitter.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440]   Twitter.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.360]   I just think the interesting thing.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.360]   I just think it break up so.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   Go ahead.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360]   You broke up with your iPhone?
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360]   I did.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.400]   I broke up with my iPhone and I've been using Uber Twitter on the BlackBerry.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.920]   And I'm going to have to say the iPhone is a better device than the BlackBerry, but the
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.080]   BlackBerry can.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.560]   And this is astonishing.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.120]   Both send and receive text messages and also make calls at my house and at work.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.520]   Oh, you have an AT&T problem is your problem.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   I saw a tweet from somebody who said, now I understand why there's so much hate from
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520]   the didgerati.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.520]   ATD sucks in San Francisco.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.800]   When people come to visit San Francisco, they go like, Oh, now I know what you've been talking
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.560]   about all this time because it's just it's appalling.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.080]   I mean, I shouldn't be.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   It's one thing that, you know, I live up here in a tree house and I guess it would make
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.840]   sense that I don't have great coverage.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.200]   But in downtown San Francisco, South of markets, not be able to make a caller send a text.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   Suck at AT&T.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   That's just embarrassing.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.520]   That is I admit it.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.080]   I was sad when I heard you dumped it, but I agree.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.080]   That's terrible.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.080]   I can't believe that.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   I have great service and I'm out in the middle of the West Desert in Utah.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.760]   I don't know why I'm getting better service than you.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.480]   It doesn't make sense in a big city like that.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.400]   It's probably too many people or if it's, you know, it has something to do with the geography
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.560]   and just there are too many being too many people trying to get on to the 3G network
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.080]   at the same time.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.320]   And I feel like there should be ways that they can fix it, you know, by installing repeaters
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.680]   around the city or putting up new antennas or it's just like a bandwidth thing.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.840]   There's just too many people on at the same time.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840]   Show of hands.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.320]   How many of you go to Verizon if iPhone shows up on Verizon?
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   In one second.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   Instantly.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.320]   Veronica?
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.440]   I had bad Verizon experiences in the past.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.240]   The only time I would switch was if it went to T-Mobile.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   Really?
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   T-Mobile.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.240]   Wow.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   T-Mobile.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.240]   Well, you can--
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.240]   Jellbreak.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   Yeah, I know.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.760]   I have no interest in being on that.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.320]   And a lot of people ask me why I didn't just jailbreak my iPhone and go to T-Mobile.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.200]   And I have no interest in being in that kind of running gun battle with Apple once I
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   jailbreak the phone.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   Like, it's just that you know what it is?
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   It's a pain in the butt.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   Well, you know what Apple says.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   And I just don't want to deal with it.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   I want it to be legit.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.960]   Apple says you jailbreak your iPhone and the terrorists win.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   Also, I don't want to be a terrorist.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.960]   That's just not nice.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   You're the problem, Molly would.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.800]   No, I'm not though, because I decided to be a good citizen instead.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.680]   I have talked to more and more people who for a number of reasons have abandoned the iPhone.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.800]   In fact, Jason Calicanis just wrote a scathing article about Apple and how he was, you know,
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.640]   felt abandoned by Apple is moving away.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.320]   A lot of people with the Google voice application problem last week where Apple blocked the
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.680]   Google voice from the iPhone.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.560]   I think do you think that last week's Twit was a really much, pretty much like a bunch
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.200]   of us going, "Weeee Apple, you broke our hearts."
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.960]   Now, Molly, you've never been an Apple fan.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.800]   No, in fact, I'm kind of happy to see everybody finally coming around.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   The trans-
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   No, I'm going to think, "Wha, wa, wa."
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.080]   I think, like, on the one hand, everybody who suddenly discovered that the closed platform
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   that is the iPhone is, in fact, a closed platform, I kind of want to say, like, "What
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.240]   are you so surprised about?"
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.840]   You know, of course, this was bound to happen.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.040]   And of course, they don't want Google voice on the iPhone.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.280]   That is actually not surprising, not unexpected from, you know, giving everything that they've
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.200]   done with the iPhone and the App Store approval process so far.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.960]   And hardly the only reason to leave if you're going to leave.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.200]   Like, for me, it's a great device.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   It doesn't work on AT&T.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   It's that simple.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   And yes, it is a lot of art.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.000]   Well, they're working on a good web app now, right?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.440]   For Google voice, that's the next thing they're going to do is make a really good app.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.760]   David Pogge had this story in the New York Times.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.760]   That is fascinating.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.520]   Google says, "No problem.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.080]   We will do it as a web app.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.360]   It will have every one of the features.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.720]   Now block us Apple.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   Now block us AT&T."
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.120]   And I've been already using it that way a little bit for sending text messages back
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.600]   and forth on Google voice.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.600]   That's not a pretty well-known app.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.880]   It works really well now, as a matter of fact.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.320]   We took so much heat for that on apps lappy.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.080]   I can't tell you how many readers were mad at me because initially I kind of said, "I
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.080]   was a little sympathetic."
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.960]   I was like, "All right, well, look, AT&T wants to control their network.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.000]   Google's maybe got something going on with Google voice.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.920]   It's just going to kill the network.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.560]   You know, I'm making these excuses for Apple."
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.440]   And my gosh, I had people...
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.720]   I've never had so much hate mail about any issue.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   So people really are have worked up about that.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.960]   Do you think that this is the beginning of people turning on Apple?
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.800]   Oh, man.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   As I stand...
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.800]   I don't know.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   It goes back all the time.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   No way.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   No.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.840]   Because really, if you think about it, the people who are angry about Google voice or
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.880]   the few hundred people who are invited to the Google voice thing right now, you know?
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.680]   I mean, I just don't think that the mainstream, the people who are really snapping up the iPhone
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.600]   and droves who have perfectly good AT&T service in the middle of America or wherever they
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.960]   live, I honestly don't think they care.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.960]   I think they don't know.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   They're such an echo to find.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   It's just fine.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   It matters to us.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.280]   It doesn't matter to real users half the time, you know?
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.520]   Who have no idea what Google voice is and no matter how many times you try to explain
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.280]   it, they kind of don't get it, you know?
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280]   That's true.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280]   It is a little hard.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.280]   It's gonna be hard to explain.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.720]   They say, "Okay.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.960]   So you're saying instead of making my phone to make a call, I call Google voice and then
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   they call me back and then I'm making the call on my phone, but I'm not using..."
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   But I'm not really...
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.360]   They go like, "Oh, is it Skype?"
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   And then you just go...
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.200]   No, you're still paying for minutes.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   So...
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   So...
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.680]   You're gonna say that Google voice is really nice when you're testing a lot of different
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.840]   phones at the same time.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.840]   That's what I use it for.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.840]   Yeah, sure.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.400]   Sort of having to get a number for a small population.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.600]   That's the echo chamber right there.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   I know.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.240]   You know, for those of us who have eight different cell phones, there's nothing like
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.240]   Google voice.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.840]   For those of us who have review units, raining out of the sky.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.480]   Oh my gosh, Google voice.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.040]   Well, you know, I often wondered if it wouldn't be smart for somebody to design a product that
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:43.080]   would just like make Walt Mossberg so happy that, you know, just jump up and down and
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:49.200]   David Pogue and Ed Begg, all the big reviewers and, you know, and Ryan Block and Veronica
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   and Molly.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.120]   And everybody goes, "Oh, this is the best thing ever."
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.440]   Even though it has no usefulness for anybody else, wouldn't it be a success?
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.880]   Because everybody says, "Well, I'll have to...
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.360]   I gotta have that."
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.360]   Maybe that's what Twitter was.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.360]   You mean?
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   I think that's what Twitter is actually.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   I think that's...
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.840]   You know what I think that product is?
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   Chubby.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   Chubby.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.840]   Definitely.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.840]   I still want one.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   I don't know why.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   I want one so bad.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   Well, you guys...
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.840]   Yeah, it's something...
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.400]   Okay, so I have a chubby that's in the drawer that I will give one of you, the winner of
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.640]   tonight's show, gets...
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   Real tight.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   My old chubby.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   I think so.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   Farm wrestle or just straight up my wrestle.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   I don't even know where to go with this.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.640]   Well, you're on diagonal monitors.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.640]   You're on diagonal monitors.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.440]   If there was some way you could like, spit at each other across the screen.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   I don't know.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.440]   I don't know.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.440]   No, I tell you, I thought...
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.440]   I had to get an ad to get enough crap around here.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.640]   You can't turn me against my friend Veronica over at Chubby.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.440]   Oh, you don't really want one, then.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.440]   Chubby won't come between us.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   Oh, geez.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.840]   Everyone will come between us.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   You must really want one.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.840]   I'll get it for later.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:55.040]   Here, I'll put you in a double box and let you guys fight it out.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   You could figure out who gets what.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.440]   No, I got the chubby.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.040]   I thought this will be really cool for video, right?
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.640]   I don't know video what, but video like...
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.840]   I could use this somehow and it's just stupid.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.840]   It's just stupid.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.840]   There's no reason for a chubby.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.640]   Fighting each other.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.440]   Fight girls, fight!
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.640]   For those of you not watching at home on video, you are missing an amazing bow.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.240]   And/or you were totally bored and baffled.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.240]   Yeah, since like a fight with a blue screen that's usually de-vore-ac.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.240]   You're getting you!
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   Facebook now, the fourth largest site in the world, the global rise of Facebook.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.840]   Nothing less than a standing says Eric Schonfeld writing in Tech Crunch in the month of June
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.640]   alone it gained 24 million gained, 24 million uniques.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.040]   For a total of...
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.040]   Drum roll please.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:56.040]   340 million unique visitors worldwide.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   Wow.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.040]   Crazy.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   Do we know?
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   Do we have any idea what my space was at its peak?
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   At its moment.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.040]   My space at its peak.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.040]   What was their moment?
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.040]   What was the peak?
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.040]   Moment that had been.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.040]   April 2008.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   But I don't know exactly what that was.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   I think it was 150 million eyes I remember.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   I think so.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   Yeah, I think that sounds about right.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.040]   Passes remarkable.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:30.840]   Now, according to Facebook itself, they only acknowledge 250 million active users.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   But I think that if you think about it, people will visit their face.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.840]   If you get 340 million uniques a month, that's because it's people visiting their pages again
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   and again, right?
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   Yeah, I mean the pages are becoming like landing areas for bands and people and personalities.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.840]   And so they're trying to kind of take that home page style market that MySpace has had
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   for that kind of thing as well.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.840]   I don't know if it'll pick up in the same way that MySpace has for music and entertainers
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   and movies and videos and that kind of thing.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   But it's possible.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   I mean, it's just going to take a while for people to make that mental shift to think that,
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.840]   "Oh, I can go to Facebook to interact with my favorite bands and personalities."
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.840]   I wondered if that shift had already happened because I know, you know, MySpace has long
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   been the domain of bands, but Facebook had sort of picked up any of that.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:23.840]   Long ago, I started using Facebook as kind of, not long ago, like last month, as long ago
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   as the dog years and internet age as kind of more of my, it's almost I think becoming
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.840]   people's blogs.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   If you go to Facebook.com/leoloportthefanbaje, that's more and more becoming like the blog,
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   right?
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   The center of the universe for me.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   And I just think that that's the trend.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.840]   That's where it's heading.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.840]   Get this.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.840]   In the month of June, 77 million uniques in the US.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.840]   That's like a third of the US.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.840]   Yeah, people get Facebook.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   You're talking about how they don't get Twitter or they don't get some of these other technologies.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   They totally get Facebook.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   My mom gets Facebook.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   They do.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   She totally gets it.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   If you.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.600]   As much as Twitter seems like it's dead simple, Twitter is hard to, we've talked about this.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.360]   It's sort of hard to get a foothold on Twitter and hard to get that conversation.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.120]   Easy to use, hard to understand.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.920]   But everybody, you have to figure it out.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.920]   You have to figure it out.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.880]   All of a sudden you're in contact with all the people that used to go to high school within
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   their fat now.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   So woo hoo.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.880]   You know?
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   That's easy.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.840]   Yeah, I get that.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.360]   That is not true of any of my Facebook friends from high school.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   They're all gorgeous.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   I'm sure.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.360]   Not those ones.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.360]   Not my friends.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.640]   No, my friends are fat.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.640]   Facebook.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.280]   Facebook has been really good about getting people that you care about together.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.200]   Twitter's gotten really good about bringing people together that may have no idea who the
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   other guy is.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.080]   But Facebook, as long as it has that sort of my mom, my sister, these guys I went to
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.280]   high school with, my buddy from college, they're going to kind of win that whole, you know,
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.120]   the social part of social networking.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   Mm hmm.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   I think that.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.960]   So I said their number four, do you want to guess a gang who one, two and three are?
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.800]   I think you probably could do that pretty quickly.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.320]   Google Google Google, right?
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.760]   Google with get this 844 million uniques.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760]   Wow.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.760]   Good Lord.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.520]   That's a third of the.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   What is that?
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.520]   That's the third of the.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.680]   I mean, if you take out 80 people over 80 and under 12, it's everybody.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.680]   That's remarkable.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.560]   And of course they would stood a DDoS attack.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.720]   If they're getting that kind of user ship, that's that alone is a DDoS attack.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.880]   Well, and of course Facebook kind of weathered it because what is Twitter?
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.280]   Like 20 million users, I think 45, 45 million.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.280]   Okay.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.280]   Growing fast.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.280]   Hire than I thought.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.120]   I'm thinking Yahoo's got to still be in the top three.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.120]   Aren't they like half a million?
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.840]   Yahoo, five hundred and eighty one million.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.840]   Very good.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:44.520]   Molly would probably like live Microsoft total, not just live, but the whole Microsoft is
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   number two.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   That's a 71 million.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   Then Facebook.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.120]   You know, here's another surprise.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.920]   Wikimedia is number five.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   Really?
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.320]   Oh, that's a big sound to me.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.320]   A lot of people are.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   Right on Wikimedia beating.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   Well, they have.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.520]   You know why?
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.920]   Because it's all coming from Google.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.720]   They have such remarkable SEO.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   Oh, that's a big.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.080]   Like they have such high Google, you know, Google search, which has always like first
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.320]   or second result for most things.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.600]   Some people have thought that that's a little suspicious that that Google is maybe preferring
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   Wikipedia.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.040]   I have wondered about that.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.040]   What, but why?
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   I don't know.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.080]   Those entries are so keyword filled.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.920]   I mean, they are perfectly keyword.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.920]   Just naturally.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   Yeah, I grew Scott.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.360]   Well, and I can imagine Google's algorithm saying this is perfectly relevant because this
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.200]   is in fact the purest form of like information about the topic that you're searching for,
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.320]   you know, I'm trying to remember the blog post I read.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.520]   I was a John Gruber.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.560]   I can't remember somebody was saying it had compared Google search results over a period
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:45.080]   of three or four years and bemoaned the fact that in three or four years ago, if you search
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.000]   for something, you would still find good results, but there'd be a more variety.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.640]   You'd be a variety of different pages.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.760]   And now if you search for something in Google, you really tend to get mainstream media,
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.920]   Wikipedia, you know, the same old suspects over and over again.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:08.560]   Is that because people have figured out how to do it right so that Google finds them?
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.080]   Or is it Google up to something?
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.040]   By the way, a lot of those sites are Google sites.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   You find Google.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.680]   So they're pretty limber with this.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.440]   They change this stuff up all the time.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.120]   And when I worked for a company for a while, where our goal every day was to say, how do
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.200]   we get keyworded in the best possible way without actually breaking service agreements
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   and making them mad?
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.880]   I mean, there's tons of like SEO specialists whose whole job it is to like make sure that
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.840]   your results come up on top.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.200]   So there's ways to game it for sure.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   But you really want that.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   I think you want the diversity.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.000]   Don't you want Google to?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.520]   I think Google has a I think Google has always had a little bit of a relevance hegemony.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.120]   I mean, it's almost it's almost a search result popularity contest in some ways.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.200]   Like there is other information out there, but you really don't see it.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.200]   And you kind of, I do wonder if Google could benefit from something that just kind of said
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.280]   like turn off relevance, just show me everything.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.160]   Just put on the front page the things that are, you know, maybe totally weird, but actually
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.480]   fit my query the best.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.280]   And I would just kind of be curious to see it would almost be like some sort of Wolfram
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.320]   alpha experiment, basically, just to see what would happen if relevance was off.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.080]   I have to say when I search for say Scott Johnson, and I see Wikipedia as one of the
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.000]   links, that's the first one I go to anyway.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   So Google's just giving me what I really am looking for.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Right.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.680]   And some of that, some of that, you know, those results are based on, I know Google says it's
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.800]   not based on clicks, but I have to think there's something in there that says, okay, well,
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.360]   a lot of people clicked on the Wikipedia article for my name.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.080]   Therefore, that has higher relevance than something that's keyworded better.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.600]   I just have to think that's the case.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.920]   I'm not 100% about that, but I just Google's always said, oh, no, it's all totally organic,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.400]   but I don't buy it.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   No way.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.040]   Maybe it's not only based on clicks, but come on.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.240]   Everything on the web is about clicks.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.200]   Well, have you guys been using Bing regularly?
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.600]   Have you been trying it out?
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.840]   No, I don't think the results are awesome.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.480]   I think they're kind of bad.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.480]   I think the results are pretty questionable, actually.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.000]   I use it for video search.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.440]   I actually find it very useful for video search and better than Google in that way, but
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:14.360]   even then, not that often because honestly, anymore, I just control K into my Chrome toolbar
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.200]   and type whatever I want to search for.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.320]   And then, you know, since I've never changed it to Bing, it's like, ooh, I don't go to
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.600]   a search homepage and can't remember the last time I ever did.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.840]   So it just, I had kind of a, I had kind of an ooh, shiny week.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.240]   Oh, I guess that's a good idea.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.600]   I went back to Google after that, pretty much.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   All right.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.760]   There is a blind, we should do this.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.680]   There is a blind search engine test.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.680]   Oh.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.760]   Oh, all right.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.600]   Let me give you the link to this.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.840]   It's blindsearch.fegus.com.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.840]   Go there quickly before everybody else does.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   I'll shoot you.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.840]   I know, it's totally all too, like, yeah.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.840]   Fegis.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.840]   It's definitely, it's down.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   It's already down.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.480]   I know, I was going to say, my little and that boat can't even handle like more than
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.680]   one tab open at a time without dropping my Skype call.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.920]   So, you know, you, you mentioning everyone on the Google bar made me wonder, I haven't
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.600]   even tried, but is there no?
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   That wouldn't work.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:13.200]   I'm thinking, it wouldn't be funny if you could put Bing in as your default search toolbar
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.560]   for Safari, which I'm using now.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.040]   You can do it, obviously, for IE very easily.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.680]   You could do it for Internet Explorer.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.200]   There is a way to do it for Safari, but it's non-trivial.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.280]   Oh, see, I thought all the browsers just kept it like an updated list of preferences and
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.840]   search engine preferences that you could choose.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.240]   It wouldn't be nice if Apple would do that.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:39.960]   Yeah, I actually was going to try Bing, you know, I mean, try to be fair and say, I'll
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.600]   do Bing for a week.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.640]   But in order to do that, I'd have to modify Safari because I use Safari most of the time
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.200]   and I couldn't find an easy way to do that.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.520]   And they don't include that seed.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   That's not cool.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.520]   It's not cool.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.160]   Again, Apple showing that it's not exactly open.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   Not exactly.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.560]   I think you could say they are not exactly open.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.320]   But everything else is so cool.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   But it's cool, but not open.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.920]   Last week, I said Apple was like Mussolini's Italy.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   You had no freedom, but the trains run on time, right?
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.760]   It's a very beautiful prison that you live in.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.920]   Like white collar jail.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.160]   So it's really nice.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.320]   Yeah, white collar jail.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.320]   It's nice here.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   It's nice here.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.320]   It's nice here.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   It's not fine on Thursdays.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.320]   That should be their ad campaign.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.120]   They should come to Apple and it's nice here.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.120]   It's nice here.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.360]   I have five max in here and they're all looking a little ominous now.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.360]   Thank you, Molly.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.920]   They're like surrounding me.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.320]   How do you like living exactly how Steve wants you to live?
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.120]   It's Steve's world.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.520]   We just live in it, Molly.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.840]   Now I'm just blatantly baiting.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.840]   That's good.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   No, bait, bait, bait away.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.840]   Blat, blatantly, blatantly, blatantly.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.840]   Blat away.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.840]   Blat away.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   Blat me.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.840]   Not like me.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   Blab, blab, blab, blab, blab.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   Hey, let's take a little break.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.080]   Give everybody a chance to quaff some beverages while I mention our friends.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.480]   Wow, Molly, is that you quaffing?
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.480]   It sounds a little robotic.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.480]   No, I'm not making it.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   Did I quaff?
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   I think I'm off.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   I think I'm off.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.480]   I think I'm off.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   I think it quaff her.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.280]   We're going to start a rumor that Molly's actually a silon.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   That's true.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   I am a starter rumor.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   I am a starter rumor.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.280]   Because I was a silon, I'd be making better noises.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.280]   I want to talk.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.280]   What is that?
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.280]   I wonder.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.280]   What is that?
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.280]   I wonder.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.280]   What is that?
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.280]   I wonder.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.280]   What is that?
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.280]   I wonder.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.280]   I think that's you.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.920]   I'm going to mute and see what happens.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   It's just noise.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   They're saying it's me.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   Oh, it is.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   It's you.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   It's you, Veronica.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   What did I do?
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   I didn't do nothing.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.920]   So here's what you do, Veronica.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.560]   You unplug and plug into the other port.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.360]   You're on a Mac book, aren't you?
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   Yes.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.360]   Yes.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.360]   Yeah, use a Mac book.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.000]   Use the port closest to you.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.360]   Oh, I'm on the USB hub.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.360]   Can you hear me?
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   Yeah, now you're better.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   You're all better.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   Okay.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   I just kept it the same way.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   It is a weird thing that happens with Max.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.360]   Sorry.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.400]   Whatever you start mentioning, Steve Jobs' name in vain.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   It starts.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.640]   They're actually tapped into our conversation.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.120]   That was probably my fault, even though it was not my end.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   So I apologize.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   They're making fun of me.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   They're saying I'm a freaking sound engineer.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.600]   But I couldn't hear that happening on my end.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.600]   No, you wouldn't hear it.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.840]   Yeah, you wouldn't hear it.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   Only we can hear it.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.840]   Exactly right.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   I want to talk about go to me.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.480]   Go to meeting is fantabulous.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.480]   I know you don't like to travel.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.280]   But at the same time, if you're in business, face-to-face meetings with your clients are
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.720]   often very important.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.320]   There is a way to take that conference call and turn it into something truly useful, truly
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.080]   engaging.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.480]   Everybody's as good as a face-to-face meeting.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   It's online meetings.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   You probably tried it.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.080]   But if you haven't tried go to meeting, you haven't tried the best.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.560]   In fact, you could go there right now.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.520]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.000]   And sign up for the 30-day free trial.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.560]   You'll be done before I'm done talking.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.560]   It's very easy to install.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:05.280]   And now, the next time you want to have a meeting, you can click and send an invitation.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.240]   It's very simple, automatic setup.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   Or you can even do it manually.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.800]   You're on the phone with somebody and say, "Look, just go to go to meeting.com.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.400]   This is what we're doing all the time."
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.600]   We do a fact that I just had to go to meeting the other day.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.360]   We do it with Ray Maxwell and Maxwell's house.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.200]   I said, "Just go to go to meeting.com.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.480]   They enter it in."
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.800]   They don't even have to have installed within seconds.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.600]   They're seeing your screen on their computer.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.760]   It works Mac or PC.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.880]   So they see Keynote or PowerPoint.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.360]   They see the drawings.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.360]   You can work together.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.360]   We paid for Ray's account.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.920]   And Dan said, "You don't need to pay for his account.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.680]   You hold the meeting and give him control."
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.920]   And I said, "Oh, yeah.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.840]   Because I can see his computer, too.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.200]   It goes both ways.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.760]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.760]   You're going to try it.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.760]   And you're going to think of 100 ways to use it.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.800]   I'm not even going to try to list them all.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:58.680]   It is the simplest, secure, easiest way to collaborate, to train, to demo, to do sales
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   presentations.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.840]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:07.120]   By the way, it includes phone and voiceover IP conferencing for less than $50 a month for
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.120]   this.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.120]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:17.160]   We thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.000]   I got an interesting debate.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.920]   You guys would have some opinion on this.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.200]   I tweeted this week because there's a new service, IZIA.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   Have you seen that?
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.960]   IZIA, that pays people to insert ads into their Twitter stream.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:39.640]   And I said, on my Twitter stream, I said, "IZIA ad in your stream, ads in your stream,
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.960]   instant unfollow from me."
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.280]   And then somebody said, "Well, how is that any different from an ad in your podcast?"
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.200]   And I had actually rocked me back and I had to think about it.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.200]   So, "Well, you're right.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.720]   That's just putting an ad in content.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.600]   How is that different?"
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   And I thought about it.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.040]   And I think now that you tell me what you think, guys, because this was my answer.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   And it actually shook me up a little bit.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.000]   I thought, "Boy, I guess you could put ad.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.600]   There's something that bugs me about having ads in the Twitter stream."
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   And I realized what it is.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   Why?
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   You tell me.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.720]   The reason I think, to each their own, if someone chooses to do that, that's fine.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.960]   It's their own business.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.280]   But to me, it feels like Twitter is a really personal thing in a way.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.980]   Yeah, sometimes I self-promote on Twitter to a blog post I've written or a podcast I
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.320]   didn't interview on.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:27.520]   But mostly I try to keep it my personal life, stuff that I'm doing, things I think are funny.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.680]   And when you stick ads in there suddenly, it feels like you're selling yourself in a
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.680]   way.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.680]   I don't know.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.920]   It's something about it just sounds like right to me.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.480]   I think it feels spammy, but it really isn't significantly different from having Google
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.720]   AdWords on your blog.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.440]   I don't do that either.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.280]   That the content, yeah, I don't do that either.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   Well, here's the difference.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.280]   I'm not saying anything about the content.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.800]   It feels different, but it's really not.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.120]   It's really all just content.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   Well here's what I thought.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.760]   Maybe now, tell me if I'm full of it.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:03.200]   When you intermix content with advertising with the intent to fool somebody, that's when
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.360]   it goes over the line.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.000]   Is that what I see it does?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.120]   No, in fact, they make a big point saying, "No, it's an ad."
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.520]   But it somehow seems to me that the Twitter stream, for instance, if you put Google AdWords
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.720]   in your blog post or in your content, I hate it when people do that.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.560]   When you put ads in between posts even, but if you put the ads to the right of them on
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.640]   the blog, I know that's the ads.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.760]   This is the content and they're separated clearly.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:35.160]   And I guess that's what I figure is that people advertisers pay a little bit more if
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:40.560]   the paper post thing, they pay bloggers to write articles about their products because
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.680]   it tricks consumers into thinking this is editorial, not advertorial.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.560]   I'm glad I'm not the only one here that turned this down.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.120]   I had an advertiser approach me, a specific advertiser, not somebody who does this like
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:57.800]   I see it, but someone said, "Would you be willing to do reviews even though you haven't
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   seen product or whatever?
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.680]   Put those right in your Twitter feed."
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.120]   And I was just, it freaked me out to be honest and Molly makes a good point.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.680]   I don't know why it's so different, but something feels really different about that.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.680]   I said that.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.680]   I said, Veronica said that.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   I said, "Go crazy."
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:14.600]   But here's the thing, Veronica made a really good point though.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.080]   She said, "Okay, you want to help people when you're on a show or you want to let people
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.600]   know there's a new blog post up."
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.080]   That's why they're following us.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.160]   People want to know when my new comic is up on Monday morning.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.440]   They want to know when extra life radio posted.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.320]   That's why many of them are there.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.120]   So I don't see that as a statement at all.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.920]   My bottom line is if you want me to put ads directly in Twitter, we just can't make a
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.920]   deal.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   There's no way I'm doing it.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:42.480]   I think we're at a very tough point on the web because we are very conditioned as web
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.720]   users to be anti-advertising.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.040]   I think we've been over-advertised too.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.560]   And so we're exhausted by it and we have gotten very used to a free product.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:56.720]   But the fact is that can't last forever and the line between advertising and editorial
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.120]   is increasingly blurry.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.800]   And there's this question of, "Well, okay, but what do you want Twitter to do?"
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   I'm so tired of people-
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.640]   Twitter doesn't make the money there that you do.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   Right, that's true.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.640]   But I think you are.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   Can you tell me what the ads look like in the stream?
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.400]   I haven't seen them.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.960]   In our chatroom, Noman Steven says it would be like having an ad in the middle of a conversation
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.520]   with your friends.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.120]   But is that what Twitter is anymore?
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.120]   Are you really?
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.960]   I guess that's what makes me wonder is.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.200]   I'm not sure that Twitter really is.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.480]   Even though I just said that I missed my friends when Twitter was down, I think that people
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.240]   really are branding themselves on Twitter.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.560]   And I think that it's become- the reason that it's so important when Twitter goes down
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.960]   is that there's this idea that it's this huge kind of very important thing.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   And so I can kind of-
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   Well, they're branding themselves, yeah.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   But if you're-
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   It's Twitter's going down, you're missing your friends.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   It's not because you miss their branding.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   It's because you miss their personal insights and conversation.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   I miss your brand.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.680]   But me missing my friends is not the reason that people care that Twitter went down.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.960]   They care because Oprah is on Twitter talking about her show all the time.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   I mean, you care to be-
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.960]   You care to be here totally right.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   Not other people.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.640]   To me, that's not significantly different than having ads in Twitter.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.440]   The reason that Oprah is on Twitter is to advertise.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.960]   So then I feel like if Joe Bob wants to make some extra money by putting ads in his Twitter
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.320]   feed, shouldn't he be just as entitled to do that as Oprah is to come on and basically
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.480]   spam all of us all the time with her bull crap?
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   That's true.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.960]   But I think it's for people who have been on Twitter for a super long time and you kind
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.920]   of have built up this reputation and this certain dialogue that you share with your readers
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.600]   to suddenly interject ads in there.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.320]   And I'm not really sure how they're being disclosed.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.320]   I don't know if there's like a-
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.320]   Add the-
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.320]   There's an ad.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.320]   Yeah, there's a hash tag.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.000]   Well, the problem partly is that I see it gives you all these different ways of doing
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   it.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.800]   But one way, for instance, is a pound ad.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.160]   So there's a hashtag that says it's an ad and it even says brought to you by-
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.320]   I have to say, I changed my tune.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.840]   At first I was really dogmatic saying, no, I'm not going to follow somebody that does
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.840]   this.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.640]   And then I mean, really feel like, well, it is kind of like what we do in podcasting.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.640]   But-
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.640]   I know.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.680]   I just feel like I'm not going to do it.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.960]   If I'm going to do it, I'm going to let my readers down.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.000]   I feel like they're not going to come there and they're not going to go, ah, this is
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   why they followed you.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.160]   I can't wait to see the ad you're going to post on here.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   Yeah, and Leo.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.160]   I mean, you at Leo and Scott and Molly, you all have podcasts that are, you know, well,
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.120]   maybe not buzz out loud, but the other ones are like advertising supported.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.040]   You know, that's kind of how you make your career.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.560]   That's how you make your money.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   And people expect that.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.400]   You know, if you've always had ads on there, people have come to understand that once in
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.960]   a while they're going to have to have that time where they have to listen to a little
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.560]   ad or they can fast forward and go through it.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.680]   But that's expected to suddenly interject ads into tweets where you're not normally used
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   to seeing them, I think would be really kind of misleading to my readers in a way.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.200]   I think that was, it felt wrong to me and I couldn't pinpoint why.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.800]   And I think it is there's a con, you do have a contract, unwritten contract, when you
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.440]   blog or when you Twitter that this is going to be my thoughts.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.200]   And when this ad comes in there, it's like, well, wait a minute, somebody, you're selling
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   out.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.120]   I don't think about, I don't think it's about us doing it.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.000]   I think it's the, I think it's about the, the people, it's like the same people on YouTube
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.760]   who are making kind of content distribution partnerships with YouTube.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.760]   I think it's about, it's not about necessarily the person with a, with two or three million
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.760]   followers doing it.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.120]   I think it's about people who are building a reputation on Twitter or who are just kind
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.120]   of on Twitter goofing off and then feel like I might as well get paid for throwing these
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.440]   ads in once in a while.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:27.320]   I definitely think that for us to do it would just be weird and also kind of sleazy because
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.240]   we already get paid for the brands that we've built.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:35.480]   And part of our Twitter outreach is to continue to build that brand and also like make friends,
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.480]   you know, on Twitter.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.720]   I don't, I don't, I definitely think it's not something for like us to do if that makes
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.720]   any sense.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.440]   Now this, and this bothers me less than an in-line Twitter ad by the way, but Facebook
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.080]   will do is take your aim, unless you tell them not to and the default is on that you,
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   that you can do this.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.280]   So I go to, I'm going to my page.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.440]   Molly Wood has just bought, I don't know, just, you just bought, got a new mortgage on your
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.160]   house from a mortgage lender.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.280]   I go to my page, Molly's a friend of mine.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   Molly's picture shows up on Facebook on the right saying Molly just got a loan from XYZ
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   lender.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   Why don't you?
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   Yeah, they're beacon thing.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   That's beacon.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.280]   And I'm not even getting paid for that.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.400]   I'm just saying that, that idea thing seems way better than that.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.040]   It bugs me.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.000]   And by the way, I immediately went to my Facebook settings and said, you can't do that.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.560]   But at least it's in an ad column.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   You know it's an ad, right?
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.560]   I think you know the ads.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.600]   But let's feel like Molly Wood somehow had some, some hand in it.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.520]   Well, to any extent, we're, we're getting in a Twitter hole again, as usual.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.520]   I know.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.520]   I hope we think else to talk about.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.200]   All right, I got one for you.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.040]   This is, this, this just in.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.840]   And I thank Dr. Mamunar, a chat room.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.640]   Trim has just gone out of business.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.480]   You know, trimtr.in.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.360]   This is a internet shortening service.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.000]   Trim is now in the process of discontinuing service.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.600]   Effective immediately.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.520]   Trim links will continue to redirect.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.000]   Did Bitly put them out of business?
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.720]   Yeah, of course they did.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.280]   It says there's no way for us to monetize URL shortening.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.800]   Users won't pay for it.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.600]   And we just can't develop, justify further developments since Twitter has all but anointed
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.320]   Bitly in the market winner.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.160]   How is Bitly and Tiny making their money?
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.160]   Oh, please.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.800]   That is just bitter cakes.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.600]   Don't be such babies.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   My God.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.200]   Oh, Twitter decided it's Bitly.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   We quit.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   Well, Twitter had previously anointed Tiny URL.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.400]   So maybe you could have just come in and done a better job like Billy did.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.160]   Well, here's my point.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.520]   Good reading, Trim.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:33.680]   This is this is this ties into the previous message, which is we get a lot of stuff free
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   on the net.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.800]   A lot of people putting a lot of effort, a lot of time spending a lot of money.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.880]   If there's no way to monetize, they're going to, this is, they're all going to start going
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.880]   away like Trim did.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.320]   Right?
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.320]   That was a crowded market.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.400]   That whole URL shortening thing was taken off.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.280]   I mean, like hotcakes, it was, that was the thing to do.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.240]   But nobody had figured out how to monetize it.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.640]   Bitly is maybe the closest because they're doing some data collection.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.920]   They're becoming a search engine.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.840]   They did the right thing, which is they're searching this.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   They innovate it.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.840]   Exactly.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.200]   Like I'm sorry that Trim didn't, but come on, there are 50 million URL shorteners out
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.200]   there.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.920]   And if you don't have a good, unique proposition, then buy.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   Yeah, I like Bitly.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.920]   I'm a fan.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   I use Bitly too because of the stats.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   That was great.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.920]   And then...
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.920]   I was like seeing the stats.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   What really is going to become valuable, you know, it's funny because delicious, which,
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.320]   which was there before anybody else and really had the opportunity to monetize this didn't
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.920]   really Yahoo once again drops the ball.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.400]   But the value and the way you can make money on this is the way Google makes money on its
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   search.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.280]   Bitly search, Bitly has a ton of information about links about who clicks on about, about
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   their relative merits.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.400]   They know more than dig does about some of this.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.880]   You know, the whole URL shortening thing does make me a little bit nervous though because
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.440]   even though Trim says that all the redirects will continue to work, what if suddenly they
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.440]   don't?
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.040]   I mean, a lot of people are depending on these to, you know, send information around and use
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.320]   them as permanent links to things.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.600]   And if all that breaks down, all of a sudden, what are we?
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.840]   We've got a bunch of broken URLs all over the web.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.560]   Well, they have to be used the way...
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.880]   I think you have to use these shortener services simply as throwaway stuff.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.760]   If you use them as permalink stuff you're going to hang on to for a long, long time, bad idea.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.920]   And I don't care who it is, tiny URL, Bitly, whoever.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.080]   You've got to use that for Twitter, get people stuff quick and be dumb with it.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.080]   Ken Shepis.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.120]   There were times when tiny URL would go down and when Bitly have...
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.400]   They've gone down the past, I think.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.360]   And you know, that's a big issue on Twitter, but you know, using those as permalinks is
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.600]   probably a very, very bad idea for the long run.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.120]   And don't forget the security issue because you're hiding this, the length that you're
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:38.080]   going to, and I'm sure that that's a huge problem with people using shorteners to hide
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.000]   the fact that you're going to a bad site.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   Oh, I think that...
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.600]   I think URL shorteners and Facebook and Twitter specifically are encouraging really unsafe
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   behavior on the web.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.760]   It's like, click on anything.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:54.000]   And Facebook is all about sending you emails that are like, "Click on this and add an app."
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.080]   Okay, click.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.960]   And then URLs that you don't know what they are.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.280]   I mean, it's unfathomable to be in some ways in this day and age that we're just clicking
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.280]   on links left and right.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.360]   There's no clue what's at the other end.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.280]   Yeah, I wish there was some kind of preview, like a mouse over preview, like there are
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.280]   browsers.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.280]   Well, there are.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   Yeah, and Friend Feed does that.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.280]   Friend Feed expands them.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.280]   If you use Power, Twitter, it does.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:18.560]   And I would imagine that a lot of the Twitter clients do that, I'm sure.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.520]   And Tiny URL lets you create a preview version so that you click and then you get to a landing
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.600]   page where you see a preview of that link.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.360]   But Bitly doesn't that I know of.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.080]   People send me Bitly links all the time and I just don't click on them because you never
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.080]   know.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.200]   So someone I trust or it has a really good description that I've seen floating around.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.880]   Then I will, but otherwise I just don't mess with it anymore.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.680]   That's why they work on Twitter well because you've got people you trust, first of all,
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.600]   and second of all, it's killing the 140K character problem.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.000]   So you have both those things solved and it's a great solution.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.880]   But in every other way, I'm terrified of those links.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.480]   I don't know, Neurom.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.480]   So a couple of--
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.680]   I had stuff on the internet.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.920]   A couple of patent stories in the news.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.240]   Twitter is being sued by a company called Iris Immediate Response Information System saying,
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.400]   "No, we invented that.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.240]   I'll read Iris's description.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   You tell me if this is Twitter."
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.040]   This is a Twitter conversation again, by the way.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.040]   Here we go.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.040]   Drink.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.040]   Drink.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   Again.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   I could do a different one.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040]   No, it's fine.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   No, it's fine.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   The patent system is broken.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   I mean, it's kind of stupid.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   So I don't know.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.040]   Let's hear this though.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.200]   I think Iris might have a case.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:31.680]   This is Tech Radium's flagship emergency response, mass notification communication service.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:38.200]   Iris simultaneously delivers uniform, reliable, and verifiable emergency messages to an unlimited
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.760]   number of contacts within seconds across all means and devices of communication.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.640]   Iris will confirm contact has been made and verified by the system.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.840]   So it's not a microblogging system.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.000]   They call it a mass notification system.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.480]   It's not texting.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.480]   It's not texting to groups.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480]   It's broadcast.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   It's broadcast.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   Over many different medium media.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:03.400]   One of the things that's key to this is I think to Twitter is follow, right?
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.360]   That the act of following.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.240]   And I don't know if this involves that.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.640]   It's the other way.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   Would you subscribe?
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   Maybe you would subscribe.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   You'd subscribe to it, right?
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.640]   Maybe you probably would subscribe to it.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   So it would be followed.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   Yeah, you would subscribe.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.000]   You would become part of the group, right?
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.200]   That wanted to receive the emergency broadcasts.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.120]   Sounds kind of ominous.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.920]   Simultaneously deliver uniform, reliable and verifiable emergency messages to an unlimited
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.520]   number of contacts within seconds across all means and devices of communication.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:34.680]   Well, it seems to fail an obvious test, but yeah, in terms of, you know, as it's written
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.680]   and depending on when it was granted could be problematic.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.040]   Well, here's one that really is you're right.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.560]   The bottom line and there's nothing to say.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.960]   Patton system broken.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.560]   A company called Volo Media says they invented podcasting.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.920]   And it's just too broad.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.640]   I mean, they really have to learn to.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.440]   I mean, we've had we've had this discussion a million times, Molly.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.120]   And buzz out loud in the past year over over patent disputes.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.720]   And what it comes down to all the time is that people just put out these super broad
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.440]   patents and then, you know, they expect it to like umbrella over all these different
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:09.640]   ideas and it's just it's not specific enough and it's there's always going to be problems
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:14.200]   like this going forward and these, you know, frivolous lawsuits and patent problems and
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.000]   remember when bridge telecoms said we invented hyperlinking.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.640]   Well, and in volo media's in volo media's case, like they definitely filed this patent a
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:30.200]   really long time ago, the original version, but then they amended it later to basically
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   help us.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.680]   So long that was specifically podcasting.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:38.360]   So then it's like, well, how can you after the after a ton of prior art has already been
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:43.640]   established, how can you go back and amend a patent filing to include all of that stuff
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:48.640]   that it just seems absolutely ridiculous that that patent should be granted at all.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:53.800]   But since it was, there's no question that podcasting is in trouble from volo media.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.560]   Molly talking about patent law is one of my favorite things on earth.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.560]   That's why I'm in a way.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.560]   That's why I brand you love it.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.560]   I love it.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.560]   I know.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.560]   It's crazy hot.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.600]   Did you ever consider a legal career, Molly?
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.400]   I often think about going to law school actually often.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   I think you would be awesome.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   That's my total.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.720]   Like I won the lottery and I'm just going to do a thing.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.440]   I know that it seems like that shouldn't be like a lottery dream, but boom, intellectual
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.440]   property law.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.440]   I would love to do that.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.440]   You do IP law.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.440]   Yeah, I think I would really love it.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.440]   You'd be great.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.960]   Only when she would not want to square.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.920]   No, she'd be an incredible advocate, I think.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.080]   Maybe I'll start going to night school.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.040]   Yeah, you got you know, you got plenty of time.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.320]   Yeah, some lawyer like call me or something.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.960]   Can't you know, it's too bad you can't apprentice.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.280]   Remember that's how you would learn something.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.280]   You wouldn't go to school.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.280]   You'd be an apprentice.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.840]   I'd be an apprentice to a lawyer.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.040]   I just want to take like a whole bunch of classes and then all of a sudden be a lawyer.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.040]   I don't know.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   Can you do that?
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.040]   No bar exam.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   No bar or nothing like that.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.040]   I'll take that.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.240]   You can't call yourself a lawyer until you pass the bar exam.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.240]   You should pass it.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   I'm not scared to test.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   I'm scared.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   I ain't scared.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   I hate tests.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   I hate tests.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.240]   I hate scadia or tis.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.240]   I ain't scared.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.040]   Would you do patent law?
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.560]   Well, what would I like?
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.560]   Would I do?
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.560]   Yeah, I would do patent law.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.560]   I do patent law.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.560]   I do patent law.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   I do patent law.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   I do patent trademark law.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.280]   I would do the heck out of that.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.280]   I do.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.280]   I am definitely, I am much more interested in intellectual property law specifically.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.720]   Like the kind of the first amendment stuff, the infring, you know, the intellectual property
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.720]   infringement.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.720]   And I guess I would get into patent and trademark law, but I think it'd be fascinating.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.720]   I think you're actually right.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   Fighting unfair patents.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   Awesome.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.720]   I think you should have been around in the 60s.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.720]   That's what I think.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.720]   That's my second career.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.680]   Being around in the 60s is your second career.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   Oh, really?
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.680]   Interesting.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.680]   Really?
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   That's a lot of school.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.680]   You could be like a great goal.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   You could be an agent.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   You could be an agent.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.680]   You could be an agent.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.680]   You could be great.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.680]   I mean stay in school, kids.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   Say yes, kids.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   Lots of school.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   I mean school.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.680]   Did you graduate?
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   You graduated.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.680]   Me?
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.680]   I didn't.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.680]   I didn't.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.680]   And that's why my career has gone to hell in a hand basket.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.680]   I noticed that.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   I only had that BA.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.960]   Learn from doing.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:06.960]   Be cool.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:07.960]   Stay in school.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.640]   I'm talking to Andrew, my nephew, who's your student at Cal Poly and his dad.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.640]   He's an engineering.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   Be cool.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   Stay in school.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.280]   He's gone with it.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.760]   Meanwhile, back at Squarespace, let's take a break.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.840]   And see, this is what I do.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:27.400]   I try to make it very clear that was content.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   This is an ad, right?
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.400]   It was a good job.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   He did a good job.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   This is an ad.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.120]   This is the ad portion of the show.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:37.560]   And then I, you know, I say we'll be right back after this word.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.560]   I don't...
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:39.800]   From yourself.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   From myself.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   Just like I see it as.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   Oh.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.680]   I mean, I had to say I had to pull back and say, I guess it isn't that different.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.360]   Oh, no, she didn't.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.440]   Oh, yes, she did.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.680]   Somebody asked you.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   Come on.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.680]   Somebody asked you, right?
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.960]   We can't be all in agreement all the time.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.960]   Can you do that head thing?
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   I'm trying to do...
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.960]   I can't do that head thing.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.960]   Oh, no, you didn't.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.960]   Nice.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.960]   Oh, she's got it.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   Oh, baby.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:08.920]   For those of you not watching at home, Molly Wood got it.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:09.920]   Wow.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.240]   Any of you use Squarespace?
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.240]   Just started.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.240]   You like it?
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.240]   Yeah, I'm going to use it for one of my...
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.400]   I can't really talk about you.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.400]   But I'm...
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400]   Don't say anything.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.400]   Yeah, don't give a...
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.400]   Really, really.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.400]   I have to say...
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.640]   I thought you guys were just talking smack, but you know, you're just running the line,
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.320]   but I actually got in there and got a name and I went, "Leo's not kidding around.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.040]   This is actually pretty sweet."
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:38.320]   The idea of Squarespace is it's a hosting service.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   So you get...
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.920]   I don't even want to say it's like a blog service.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.400]   It's a hosting service, but they...
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:48.560]   But running on that hosting service is the most amazing website software you've ever
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.560]   used.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.640]   I mean, these guys are brilliant designers and programmers who've decided just to make
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.520]   it easier to set up and host a website.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.080]   And it could be any kind of website.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.240]   They have an iPhone app.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:06.160]   They have social integration with YouTube, Twitter, Dig, StumbleUpon, Flickr.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.320]   But it's great for photo galleries.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.720]   Amazing templates, but even better, once you get the template in there, the way you can
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:18.240]   customize it with Ajax, you just drag and move margins around.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.240]   Amazing stats, form building data collection.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:27.280]   And look, if you're already on another platform, if you're using WordPress or if you're using
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:34.480]   a TypePad or Blogger or a moveable type, they'll import and export right out of it.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.600]   So that's important, by the way, you're not stuck there.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.440]   You can import it, you could try it, and you can export it out if you decide to go elsewhere.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.360]   So you're never trapped inside of Squarespace.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:51.280]   Free for 14 days, you'll be started in 30 seconds with no credit card when you go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.760]   So it's very simple to just try it.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.080]   No reason not to.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:59.760]   If you stick around, by the way, use the coupon code TWIT and you'll get 20% off your
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.960]   new account.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:07.200]   So Squarespace, remember the name squarespace.com/twit.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.280]   You want to find out more.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.680]   They say smarter publishing, it's just amazing.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:17.160]   And they're really a great company too, really nice guys, Dane Atkinson and Anthony Castellena
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.960]   and the gang, just really nice.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.600]   Good, I'm glad you're giving it a try, Scott.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.160]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.200]   Let me know what you think.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.800]   So page two.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:33.360]   Wow, is that where all the way to page two?
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.360]   Page two.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.920]   The sun is coming to get me.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.760]   Is it getting hot out there?
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.560]   It's like a sun is starting to creep over onto the laptop.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.320]   Yeah, I'll get a 10 on the one arm.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.200]   I like the little flare.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.400]   I like it was like Star Trek, the new Star Trek.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.800]   Remember, there was all those solar sun flares all the time?
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.040]   Yeah, I just tilt.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   I asked them about that.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.640]   They said they did that on purpose.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.640]   They were dead.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.640]   They were dead.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   I'm with you, Scott.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.640]   They didn't wait too much.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.640]   It was like, oh, my eyes.
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.640]   Yeah, I was out of control.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:05.560]   I don't know what they were thinking, but it was kind of cool once in a while, but every
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.000]   shot was something with gleaming off something else.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   It's like, holy crap, please.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   And it's all CG.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   It's all a seeming in outer space.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   So yeah.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   Well, that's true.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   There's quite a bit.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.640]   But it's all CG, so they're consciously doing it.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.000]   In space, you can see the gleam.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.840]   I'm really sorry.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:27.600]   Have we gotten over battle, Starkleactica, or we kind of gotten over the grief and all
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.600]   of that?
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:29.600]   I'm so bad.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.080]   Still, oh, you're mad.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.480]   You didn't like the end, did you?
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   No, I am angry.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.760]   I didn't like the end either.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:35.760]   I didn't love the end.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.440]   I didn't hate it, but I just missed the show in general.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.160]   I miss sort of the hard edge sci-fi sort of thing going on.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.160]   I really hope they can do that.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.160]   No spoilers.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.160]   Caprica and whatever.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.160]   I won't spoil it.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.160]   What's the deal with Caprica?
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.160]   I went straight to DVD or something like that, or is it actually going to happen?
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.160]   No, no, no.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.160]   They sent out.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.720]   They put out the first pilot episode and it's on and out.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:54.720]   It's on my Roku.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.200]   I at least sit on iTunes and other stuff.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.640]   And then it's going to air on TV, I think, and then they're going to start the actual
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.640]   series.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   Oh, good.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.640]   Okay.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   Well, that'll be something helpful.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   Kind of like they did with Glee.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.640]   Hey, here.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.640]   This just in from ShelterWatch.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:11.080]   There's an online law school which allows you to sit for the bar for $3,000 plus per
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.080]   year.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:15.080]   There's another law school which meets only Monday through Thursday at night only for
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.680]   people who want to have a law degree for nonprofits.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.280]   It's called the People's Law School $5,000 a year.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.280]   Interesting.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.280]   Thank you.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:29.920]   For $3,000 a year, you can get a bar, you know, be ready for the bar exam and $5,000
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.080]   a year, Monday through Thursday at night, nonprofit.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.080]   Thank you, ShelterWatch.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.080]   I know.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   That's really cool.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.080]   I like the idea of the nonprofit one.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.080]   That's pretty interesting.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.560]   What did it be neat if after this show Molly becomes a lawyer?
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.560]   I became a lawyer.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.600]   It was the one that like picked it off.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   I think we have a name.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.600]   Molly becomes a lawyer.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.600]   Today's the day.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   Molly becomes a lawyer.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   On a very special twit.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.600]   Magistrate.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.600]   Barrister.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   I'm going to the lightweight.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   Yes, I am.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   Barrister Wood for the defense.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:57:59.600]   That's tough.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.600]   Sony is a...
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:01.600]   I'm going to go to the bar after this show.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.600]   Just a different one.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:06.600]   And I don't need to spend $3,000 a year to pass that bar.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.600]   I just thought I'd have a big tap.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.880]   Hey, you had a good party, by the way.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.320]   Ryan Block, Peter Rojas, you hosted and I know Veronica for GDGT.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.320]   We got some great video.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.320]   Made a little movie of it.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.640]   It looked like it was a lot of fun.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:22.640]   That went well.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.640]   It was so fun.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   Colleen was there.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.640]   We missed you.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   Colleen and Dane wet.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.640]   I was a lot of fun.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.640]   We had a line around the block.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.640]   We had a lot of people showing off new gadgets.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.640]   The Zoom HD was there for the first time in public and it looks amazing.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.640]   Amazing.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.640]   Makes me kind of wish I had to Zoom.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.640]   Really?
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.640]   Donald Bell was going out.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:45.640]   No Mac's offer yet, but maybe someday.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   I'm a little...
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:51.600]   I'm a little perturbed by the fact that they imply that it's an HD screen and it's not.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:55.200]   The video, the content on it is HD though, right?
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.200]   It plays HD.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.160]   It plays it but doesn't play it in high def.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.600]   So you could put 720p on it.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.720]   It looks really good though.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:07.440]   I mean if you can tell the difference between what that display shows and like HD, then
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.560]   I don't think you'd really have much of a complaint because it's pretty sick.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:14.720]   The purpose of having the 720p on it either I assume is so you can plug it into a TV and
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.720]   really see it in HD.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.640]   There's output to TV and it looks really good too.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.080]   So I'm kind of jealous.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.760]   I have a little bit of zoom envy.
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.760]   We can get you into it when there's a...
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.560]   Oh yeah, it is a Mac software and we're ready to go.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:30.320]   Well, I do have my gaming PC and I guess I could do that way but then all my media is
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.160]   like iTunes stuff.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:36.080]   I do have some mp3s that I do from e-music but I'm lazy.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.320]   I just buy things on iTunes.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.320]   I know it's stupid.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.640]   So you're telling us you have a giant DRM content?
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.640]   Yes.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   I do.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.640]   I do.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:44.640]   Oh, it's cool.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.720]   I buy everything on iTunes plus now so it's not but you know back in the day a big part
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.600]   of my library is still all DRM to heck.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:51.600]   I know.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.600]   Blah blah blah blah blah.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.600]   Blah blah blah.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   Blah blah blah.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   Me girl.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.600]   We tried so hard.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.040]   I told you I'm exceedingly lazy.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.600]   Exceedingly lazy.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.600]   It's too easy.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.520]   Scott, you and I let's just sit over here in the corner.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.520]   We'll let them.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.520]   Yeah, we'll let them find out.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.520]   Everyone's going to give me crap now.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.520]   I know.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.520]   God darn it.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.520]   I shouldn't have said anything.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.320]   There you are in the show.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.160]   Deep dark secrets that I buy things off of iTunes sometimes.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.360]   Almost the entire point of Buzz out loud podcast is non-stop anti DRM screen and then
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.200]   we find out that our most famous alum Veronica is like, oh yeah, I'm just sitting on tons
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.200]   of protected AAC.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.960]   I do have the choice.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.960]   It's like, you know, when I see stuff, I'm like, uh, I'm just going to hit it.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960]   It's like impulse buys.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.560]   They're hurting my heart.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.560]   But they've mastered that.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560]   They're good at that.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.560]   And that's why you do it.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560]   Exactly.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.960]   So it's so fun and so awesome that you do it.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.960]   And then later.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.040]   But you're justified now because they've dropped the DRM.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.040]   So it's okay.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.040]   We all have our vices.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.200]   Well now we know Veronica is a secret booze hound and DRM lover.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.200]   Secret.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.200]   I love it.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   DRM lover.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.960]   You're a DRM lover.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.640]   Um, Dr. M dr M dr M.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   My secret love affair with Dr. M. Oh, here's some news on Caprica.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.000]   Oh, thank you.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   That room.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   They're good.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   They're good.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.280]   I'm glad that I would flip now while I wait for this news.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.280]   Caprica starts.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:21.760]   Court of Ken Shepardson January 22nd, 2010 on Sify.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.760]   Sify.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.760]   Sify.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.760]   Sify.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.760]   Sify.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:26.760]   Sify.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   What's the story with Sify?
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.800]   I feel like I like it better if I pretend it's French.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800]   Sify.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800]   How's wrong with them?
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.840]   Well, they their whole, their whole thing was at sci-fi was too general.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.840]   Like it didn't have.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.640]   Oh, so Sify is not.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.920]   I think it was too specific.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.520]   It was too specifically sci-fi.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.080]   Like they wanted to be able to branch out into other original content.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.000]   I think like, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   So now they do what?
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   So then they got Sify stories.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   What does Sify mean?
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.600]   No, Sify would be like a little bit of a...
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.600]   Sify.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   Hold on though.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.600]   I got a theory.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.600]   I mean, as again, Sify.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.640]   I will speak for the cartoonist guild of the internet and say that that gave us really
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.640]   great joke opportunities.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.640]   I bet it did.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640]   Greatful.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   Well, there's that.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.640]   I bet it did.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.000]   Isn't it like a swear word in a different language or something?
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Yeah, like a little one.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   Terrible, right?
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   What is it in Polish?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   I don't know.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.600]   I think it's bad to say over Twitch.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.600]   I can't remember though.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.760]   Oh, I was thinking of rebranding Twitch, you know, because of all this Twitch stuff.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.000]   Twitch pick and Twitch stack.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   So maybe I should just like TWYT.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.240]   Let's talk about the shacks for a second here.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.240]   The shack!
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.240]   I love it.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.240]   I'm kind of thinking.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.720]   What is wrong with people?
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   What is wrong with people?
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.080]   I think there's a renegade branding company that's going around talking executives and
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.080]   doing stupid things.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.960]   I think the shack is kind of cute.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960]   You like the shack?
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960]   Oh, God.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.960]   Are you serious?
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   It's like the hunt.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.960]   It sounds like somewhere you'd go within your woody.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960]   What?
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.960]   What?
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.960]   What?
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.960]   It does kind of die-far like record stores.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.960]   Geez!
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.960]   Leo, I knew you had technology.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.920]   It's a station wagon with wooden sides on it.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   You young people today.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:06.920]   You're so dirty-minded.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   Get off my lawn.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   Really?
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.480]   They called that a woody.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.480]   That's awesome.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.480]   My grandpa had a woody.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.480]   Yeah, the country squires.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.440]   They have a wood on the side.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.280]   They're called woodies.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.280]   And somewhere the shack sounds like somewhere you'd go in the woody with your best girl
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   to get a pop.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.960]   Yeah, it does kind of.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.080]   That's the problem is that even though I think like the shack is not- It's an okay name
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.080]   kind of, but it doesn't say anything about electronics.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.080]   That's the point.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.080]   I didn't want to say radio.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.400]   It's so blatantly just like general.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.760]   What about the Sifey shack?
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.760]   It's a sifey shack.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:39.760]   Hutt.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.760]   The Sifey shack.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:44.640]   It took out all the relative the important words from the name.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.480]   They should have called the sounds.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   No, that's a good point.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480]   Totally.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.080]   Because, okay, radio is bad, but shack is worse.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.080]   All the relevant words are gone.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.320]   Unless it's SHAQ and the basketball player is there.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.840]   And then you have a store.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.320]   Now he's the real shack.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.480]   There's a two-hour pilot of Caprica.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.680]   That's what they've put out.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.520]   And now- And then they're going to be 18 to one-hour episodes.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.520]   They're ex-dolds.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.280]   Do you really want to buy something from a place that calls itself the SHAQ?
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.560]   Like how technologically advanced can a SHAQ be?
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.560]   Do you want to buy something from-
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.160]   Oh, you want to buy stuff from radio SHAQ too?
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.520]   My big concern is that as they try to rebrand, they're going to try to become a more general
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.520]   electronic store.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.040]   And I consider them basically the ace hardware of electronics goods.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.160]   Like I do not want them to all of a sudden be getting rid of those little trays of connectors
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.720]   and aux cables and like don't start turning into Best Buy with all your little netbooks
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.920]   and TVs because I need you for like cables.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.640]   The adapters and the things.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.720]   I used to run over to RadioShack all the time to get stuff for the sound room.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.200]   That was all out.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.520]   But that's where you go because they're everywhere and you don't care if it's crap.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.520]   You just need it.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.520]   It's utility.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520]   They're like they're a hardware store.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.320]   And I think that they- I mean they have done very well with that.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.760]   They're still in business when Circuit City and Comp USA are like gone.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.760]   So why are you trying to-
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.760]   Why are you trying to be the wind?
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.760]   It's right.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.760]   Sorry, they're saying that in the chat room.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.520]   But then like why are you going to become Circuit City and Comp USA when they didn't
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.680]   make it and you RadioShack, the hardware store of electronics goods are still there.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.920]   Just be who you are.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   Be who you are.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.920]   Be yourself.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:17.920]   Love yourself.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.920]   Just be RadioShack.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.120]   I think they should have stuck with it.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.320]   Flavor should stick with it.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.320]   I agree.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320]   Great name.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.920]   Sony is going to- Boy this is becoming the e-book.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.400]   I think 2009 might be the year of the e-book.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.400]   What do you think?
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:37.480]   Sony now is a unveiling cheap small e-books relatively cheap.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.200]   They're going to do a reader pocket edition by the end of this month.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.200]   It will have-
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.200]   A 9-9 right?
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   Yeah, it's still 200 bucks.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:45.720]   It's not that cheap for a single-purpose-
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.720]   But a 2% a Kindle.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.720]   It's 100 bucks less than a-
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.640]   Yeah, but that's all it does.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   5-inch screen.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.640]   That's not bad for some Apple.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.720]   No, you use any of the audio stuff on my Kindle though.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.280]   I- Yeah, I think just for a 1-in-e-book reader.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:03.000]   For $199 for a device that has a 5-inch screen, why not get some kind of awesome Arco's
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.440]   portable media player?
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.440]   Or-
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.800]   Because battery life.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.160]   And the screen's not the same to look at for an extended period.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160]   It's hard to read all.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160]   You could use your iPhone.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.840]   And LCD screen versus a- Sorry, LCD.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.840]   You know what I mean.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:19.160]   Versus an e-ink screen, which is so much easier on the eyes.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.160]   Oh, I agree.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.480]   I just think if I want an e-ink device that I want it to be book size.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.760]   I don't really understand the idea of the reader.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.440]   I don't understand the idea of an e-ink device that's smaller than a paperbook.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.440]   A paperback even.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.760]   Yeah, it should be kind of paper-back size, huh?
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:36.760]   Yeah, I just feel like at that point, then I'm more compelled to get an all-in-one.
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:40.720]   And electronics devices, as opposed to just a little single-use thing.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.760]   Important thing to note too, these- neither of these two devices from Sony are going to
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.400]   launch with 3G, sort of the thing that really makes the Kindle attractive.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.800]   Yeah, you have to connect to your computer.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.800]   Oh my God.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.800]   Oh, can you imagine?
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   Oh my God.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.800]   It's a deal when you're traveling.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   Oh, I agree.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.800]   I totally agree.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.800]   I'm not being sarcastic.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   It's a huge deal.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.800]   Come on, how often, though?
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.440]   I mean, how many books- That's like dark ages.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.440]   How often?
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.440]   Yeah, do you put a new book on every day?
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.400]   At least probably one or two a week.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.400]   I agree.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.400]   Yeah, and you know what?
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.400]   Almost all-
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.400]   It's for a drunk.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.400]   You read a lot.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.800]   Do you read- You go through two books a week?
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   That's pretty good.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.160]   Maybe not two books, but I download things.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.720]   I don't read them that fast, but I save them for later.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:24.760]   No, and that's where Amazon has the marketing skill, because it makes us- again, it's point
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.720]   of access so easy to buy a book on the Kindle.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.720]   And they have it as an absolute selection.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.720]   They do.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.520]   It's so easy to do.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.720]   Yeah, you just pull them up and bam, there they are.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.760]   And if the App Store wasn't so convenient on the bus, you probably wouldn't see as many
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.600]   apps, in my opinion.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:45.240]   Almost every book I've ever bought on the Kindle has been a total impulse purchase,
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.920]   which means that it was nowhere near my computer.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.160]   It was like, it was, you know, after a giant beer, and somebody could talk me into buying
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.160]   infinite jazz.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.160]   Like, really?
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.160]   Did you read it?
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.160]   Did you read it?
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.640]   I just, it would just happen like three days ago.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.520]   I guess I'm gonna have to read it now, because that's $10.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.520]   I can never get back.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.720]   I've been trying to read that book for eight years.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.720]   I know, God.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.720]   How embarrassing.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:05.720]   Now, I'm that person too, with infinite jazz on my Kindle.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.960]   I look like such a jerk.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.520]   No, I, I, I think that that's where the Kindle is really good.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.840]   Because that infinite jazz was a thick book, right?
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.840]   It's huge.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.840]   It's gigantic.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:19.840]   So, but you can have it on your Kindle.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.360]   You get all the value of having carrying the book around without actually having to carry
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.360]   the book around.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.360]   Or reading it.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   And I was like, big jerk when anybody looks at my kid.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.360]   Or reading it.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.360]   You don't even have to read it.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.000]   Oh, you get the New York Times D.R.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.560]   And books are okay, Molly.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.600]   You don't just use Google book book.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.600]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, you didn't.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.560]   You should have him gave me the idea.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.560]   That was not my idea.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.400]   Oh, well, still, but he was right.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.400]   Right.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.040]   Boom goes a dynamite.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.800]   Point Veronica slash that.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:54.120]   What are we going to rename Amazon?
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   The Zahn?
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.120]   The Zahn.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120]   Ammo.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120]   Ammo.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120]   Ammo.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.120]   Ammo.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.600]   Her name is the same.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.600]   You just spell it with dumb letters.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.680]   That's all anyone else is doing.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.760]   Just spell it wrong.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.480]   So here's a job you don't want.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.760]   Yeah, only weirdos do that.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.280]   This even when you get your law degree, Molly, do not become the White House cybersecurity
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.280]   czar.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.600]   Yeah, that's the worst job in the world, apparently, huh?
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.600]   Melissa Hathaway.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   Quit.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.960]   She, she, she was the leading contender for the position according to the Wall Street
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960]   Journal.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.080]   She said, can you take my name off?
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.560]   I don't want the job.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.400]   And she's also resigned her position in the Obama White House.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.040]   She was leading the 60 day review of government wide cyber security preparedness.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.400]   Do you think she said took one look and said, this is such a mess.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.400]   There's no way.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400]   She's like, I'm out of here.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.400]   I can't.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.400]   She was like, that possible.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.400]   Wow.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.160]   I have the sense I have to say.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.200]   So Anish Chopra was in town.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.160]   Everybody knows now like rock star.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:02.400]   And I really had the sense after his talks and after he came on Buzz out loud that they're
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:08.240]   kind of front loading technology related personnel in the White House, but it's not
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:11.440]   entirely clear what the differences and all their jobs are.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.160]   And I have the sense that maybe that whole cybersecurity thing is kind of just a weird,
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.280]   unfunded mandate and that it's the kind of terrible job where, you know, there's a lot
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.160]   of pressure, but maybe no clear idea what you're supposed to do or how you're supposed
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160]   to get it done.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.040]   30 people are rumored to have been offered and refuse.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.040]   Oh my gosh.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.880]   I mean, what other White House positions have 30 offers that people turn down?
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.880]   That's crazy.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.680]   And who is turning down offers to work in the Obama White House?
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.760]   I mean, people are so like desperate to do that, but that one job, whatever it is.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:51.800]   Well, the reason is that they made a political concession on this that the cyber czar would
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:58.280]   be beholden to both the national security council and the national economic council.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:04.720]   So you have kind of two masters and to Anish Chopra, the CTO and to the chief information.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.600]   So you got four bosses and it's kind of unclear what the differences and all those jobs are
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.600]   anyway.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.440]   Like it is a mess up in there.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.440]   You feel like they're like token positions.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440]   They're not.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.440]   They've got really no authority.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.640]   They're there to say, Hey, look how open and technology minded we are as an administration.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.280]   And that's it.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.160]   It's going to be like I'm thinking that Anish Chopra has about six months to really hit
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.760]   people with some specifics.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.720]   Otherwise, it's going to look like that's a little bit of a PR job.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.720]   Tell us about him.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.600]   Did you get a chance to talk to him?
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.600]   I did.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.600]   I mean, he's a really, he's a really nice guy.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.040]   I get the sense that he is legitimately interested in technology.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.040]   He really wants to know.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.040]   He came on Buzz out loud.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.040]   That's impressive.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.880]   He's like a fan of the show.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880]   He talked to Scoble.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.280]   I mean, he even knew who Scoble was.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.440]   Like I think he is kind of a legit tech guy.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.320]   I don't, I really don't.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.640]   And we asked him and then he talked about it in his speech later at the computer history
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.640]   museum.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.560]   What is your job and how is it different from the CIO and the cybers are?
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.320]   And frankly, to me, I know I still don't know.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.880]   I still don't know what a job is.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.040]   I don't know what the difference is.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.040]   You're more confused.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.000]   And it was just like, Oh, you guys need to maybe, but you might be a little top heavy in
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.520]   the cyber department.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.520]   What is your job?
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.520]   I don't know.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.520]   What is your job?
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.360]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.360]   Do this.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.240]   Like really nice guy.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.160]   Not sure what he does or what he's supposed to do.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.240]   When the windows doesn't work, I come over and I bang on the box.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.880]   No, that's the CIO, but that's not him.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.080]   Like it's just, you know, a lot of those things were like, well, that's kind of the
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.080]   CIO, but maybe that's the cybers are, but then that's sort of me, but then it's like
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.080]   it.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.080]   I don't know.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.240]   He seems qualified to do things.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.240]   He's qualified.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.240]   Yes.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.640]   I think he might just go in there and talk about technology things.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   That must be it.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.320]   So, I don't want to pot.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.240]   I don't, I mean, this is an important thing.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.840]   I mean, the next war will be a cyber war for sure.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:07.800]   Look what, you know, I mean, look at Russia did to this poor blogger, one guy.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.400]   I mean, this is not a, this is not a throwaway position.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.400]   You have to show.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.400]   Right.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.320]   So whatever it is that's causing people to walk away from that cybers are position,
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.880]   and I hope that with this woman leaving and saying, hell no to the job that they are
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.960]   going to, that they're going to restructure because you're right.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:28.520]   It is really important and clearly they have it just kind of not, not structured right
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.760]   in a management way, you know.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.400]   Hello, American.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.880]   Stand by for commercial.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.880]   We're going to come back in just a second.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.840]   I want to talk about Rupert Murdoch.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:44.920]   He's the new, he's the crazy of the week and a new feature on the show, the crazy of the
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920]   week.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.680]   But first a word from audible.com.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.840]   The folks who do those great audio books that yes, they have DRM on them.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.560]   It's not their fault.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.240]   It is, it is very easy when you buy a book.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.240]   It's yours forever.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.120]   You can go back to the site and download it again and again.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.680]   They play on the hundreds of different devices, your iPod, your zoom, your iPhone.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.680]   They play everywhere you go.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:13.680]   I mean, I have to say audible to me, audible is really straightforward and not a problem
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.680]   in any way.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.160]   I just listen to it all over the place.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.080]   It even plays on your Kindle, which is kind of cool.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.560]   So if you want to have a book on your Kindle, and let me just check and see if infinite
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.560]   just.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.160]   So you can read a lot.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160]   Oh, stop.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.240]   Oh, how embarrassing.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.400]   How long would that be though?
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.000]   If you let's do, let's just have an infinite just book group internet.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Let's do that.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.400]   You all get it on your, on your audible and I'll have it on my Kindle and then we'll
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:42.120]   just kind of will spend like three years trying to read it and then we'll all give up together.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.120]   It'll be great.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.640]   You've been making me want to read it.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.320]   It's actually a very good book, but it's just telling you, let's read it together.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320]   It'll be great.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   All right.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.600]   Someone else can be in charge of reading the footnotes.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:59.120]   Audio, audio books are a really good way to read books like that that you just can't
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120]   get through.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.400]   You know, if you have you seen Julie and Julia yet?
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.640]   Oh, I want to see.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.040]   Oh, you saw it?
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.240]   I want to.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.240]   You didn't see it, Molly?
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.240]   I thought Molly said.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.240]   No, not yet.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.400]   Really wonderful book.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.880]   If you want to read the book before you see the movie, I highly recommend it.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:21.240]   Of course, it's a new movie, but you can read the book is by Julie Powell, 365 days, 524
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.400]   recipes, one tiny apartment kitchen.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.880]   This is a true story.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.720]   She decided to make every recipe in a Julia Child's The Joy of French Cooking.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.720]   That's what the movie is about.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:37.520]   Of course, Meryl Streep plays a Julia Child in the movie, but what a wonderful book, highly
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.520]   recommended.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.520]   You can get it at audible.com.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:45.120]   I like before I see a movie, I often like to read the book just in case, just in case
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.560]   the movie is not so good.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.760]   I don't want it to spoil the book.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.800]   So read the book first and you can read it right now.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.320]   Absolutely free by going to audible.com/twit2.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.480]   In fact, I'm going to give you two books.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.400]   They don't have infinite just.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400]   I just checked.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.720]   Not enough room on their servers.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:00.720]   Probably not.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:06.520]   Probably not, but you could pick another great cooking book or great thriller sci-fi.
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:09.480]   I know before you pick books on the sword and laser, you often listen.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.840]   In fact, that Game of Thrones is available.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:19.240]   Yeah, I'm just reading right now a book called The Beekeepers Apprentice on Audible, I guess,
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.120]   listening to, not reading.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.400]   But it's all about a girl that meets up with Sherlock Holmes in his later life and becomes
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.400]   like his apprentice.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400]   It's really cool.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.680]   Oh, that sounds great.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.680]   All right.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:35.120]   We got two books, Julia and Julia and The Beekeepers Apprentice by Laurie R. King.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.800]   Oh, that sounds really good.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.720]   Is that going to be on sword and laser or are you just reading it?
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.080]   No, I'm just reading it for fun.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.920]   They're listening to it for fun.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.600]   Audible, do you see me doing it?
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.600]   Is that the right?
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.920]   I always have said reading when it's an audible book because I feel like I can't pick another
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.920]   way to put it.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.920]   You're reading it.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920]   Devorak gives me a hard time.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.080]   It's every word that would be in the book.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.280]   It's as if when your mother reads out loud to you, is she reading?
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.280]   Yes.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.280]   You're reading the book.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.280]   You're reading the book with her.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.200]   Can I make a recommendation for dudes?
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.680]   So because you got these two shitty books.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.680]   Those were a chick book.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.080]   It's a freaking Sherlock Holmes book.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.280]   That's not just how some woman need it.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.880]   That doesn't make it a chick book.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:16.040]   I'm just saying everybody should go to Audible and they should get the Dark Tower series specifically
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:21.120]   book on the Gunslinger by Stephen King, read by Steve or what's her name?
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120]   Goudelle.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.120]   George Goudelle.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.120]   Oh, George Goudelle is one of their best readers.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.760]   I read those books far too young, I think.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.960]   Those I read the messed up my head.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:29.960]   Oh, really?
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.360]   I read them within the last three or four years and I listened to all of them actually.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.560]   I think that they were all Audible books for me and though that guy who reads especially
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.760]   the Gunslinger, oh, it is just wonderful.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.760]   I know.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.040]   What a great series that is.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.840]   I'll play a little bit of it so you can hear his voice.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.000]   George Goudelle is one of their best readers.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.920]   I've listened to so many books that he's read.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.640]   So was the horn he had once carried?
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   Gone for years.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640]   Gotcha.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.840]   And all of them spilled from the end of a diary.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.400]   Other worlds than these.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:58.680]   And he missed them both.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:02.680]   He breasted a gently rising dune although there was no sad.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.680]   Absolutely the best guy to read this book.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:05.680]   Oh, God.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.240]   I know that book particularly.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.240]   Oh, any book.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.240]   Any book.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.240]   I know.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.920]   I also read a good collection on Audible lately.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:14.920]   What was it called?
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.160]   My Supernatural Wedding.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:21.640]   It's a collection of all different sci-fi and fantasy writers with like, it's like all
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:26.040]   the common theme is like weddings and there's like werewolves and vampires and all this
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.040]   really funny stuff.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.680]   It was like a pretty natural wedding.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.560]   My big fat super natural wedding.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.360]   I love the idea.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.360]   All right.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.000]   Well, how many books is that now?
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   Five?
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   Four?
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.160]   Anyway, you get two free.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.160]   What's just signed up?
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.160]   Twice.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:44.160]   Audible.com/twit2audible.com/twit2.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.800]   You get your first two books free if you sign up for the platinum account.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.800]   That's what I have.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.960]   Two books a month.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.960]   That's not enough for Veronica.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.640]   She does two books a week.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.640]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.960]   It really is a great way to listen to a book.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:03.480]   I don't think you guys have long commutes but just in the plane, working out in the gym,
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.480]   just wherever you are.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.680]   It's a great way to listen.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.760]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.760]   We thank you so much for their support.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:15.800]   Oh, Hodgman's new book is on Audible now too.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.800]   Oh, the new one.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.800]   Yeah, because the old one was.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.240]   Yeah, more information than you require.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.040]   It just came up recently, I think.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.040]   The first one is the areas of my expertise.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.040]   Yeah, right.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.880]   Does he read more in front more?
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.360]   I actually know.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.720]   Him and Colton do it again, I think.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.720]   I heard they were doing it again.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:32.720]   Oh, he's Colton in it too.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:33.720]   I haven't listened to it yet.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:34.720]   Yeah, man.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.720]   Good.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:36.720]   That was so much awesome.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:37.720]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.720]   So full of awesome.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.760]   When he sings the Harry Old Lobster song, I just love that.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.440]   Well, you've seen this has got to get into it.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.840]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.320]   We thank him so much for their support.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.520]   Lots of great stuff.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.480]   I asked John Hodgman to, I'm going to be doing a keynote at Macworld.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.720]   I'm doing the one that David Polk did, the Macworld Live keynote, which is kind of like
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.720]   a tonight show.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.880]   In fact, I love you guys to be on it.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.520]   Not you, Molly, because you hate the Mac.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.320]   But I frankly think that makes it more hilarious.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.040]   You should come on, actually.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.040]   You could come up.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.040]   I will go.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.040]   I'll be your counterpoint.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.040]   Do a rant.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.040]   Or, oh, I know.
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.040]   You could just sit.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.680]   You could be like, man, except instead of laughing, you could snort at everything.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.680]   Yeah, I'll just come and be the PC.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.680]   But don't die.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:21.680]   Ha!
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:26.200]   I asked John to come on, but now he's speaking at this thing called, I don't know, Ted,
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.200]   something like that.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.200]   So he couldn't do it.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.200]   Some little show you gave for them.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.200]   Shout-out.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.200]   He was good.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.760]   If you've not seen his Ted talk from last time, it's awesome.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.280]   It's so funny.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.280]   It's great.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.520]   Cut is he brilliant.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.080]   So talking about crazy lunes, our Loon of the Week, Mr. Rupert Murdoch, who has told
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:49.840]   analysts in a conference call after releasing such crappy results for News Corp that some
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:54.760]   people wondered if he could even survive, Murdoch said, "The digital revolution has
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:21:00.120]   opened many new and inexpensive methods of distribution, but it has not made content
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.320]   free.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.520]   Accordingly, we intend to charge for all our news websites."
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.520]   Whoa.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.920]   Well, if any guy was going to say it, it would be Rupert Murdoch, right?
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:16.080]   The one guy who has made money off of charging for a news website, the Wall Street Journal
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.560]   website, has been behind the paywall since the beginning of time, despite, you know,
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.360]   how's a protest, and makes money.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.360]   And financial times.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360]   He paid a lot for it.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.840]   And financial times.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:29.280]   But Jeff Jarvis pointed out yesterday on our This Week in Google show, those sites make
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.280]   people money, right?
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.080]   Because they're financial sites.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.680]   And the other thing he said is, and by the way, the boss usually pays for it.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:39.320]   It's a business expense or your company pays for it.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:45.760]   Can you really get somebody to pay for the sun or the daily telegraph?
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:46.760]   Probably not.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.760]   The New York Post.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.760]   Somebody's not going to pay money to see the New York Post.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:52.760]   People will just go...
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.760]   The journal's just different people.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.360]   The journal people have to have it.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.840]   They got to have their fix and they'll pay for it.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.840]   I pay for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:00.840]   I'm going to go to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.840]   I'm going to go to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.840]   But I pay for the website too.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.280]   I mean, I think it, I do agree.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.920]   I think it's a totally different kind of content.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:11.320]   And I think that he must be bluffing or he plans to...
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.440]   Because the problem is taking something that was free and making it for pay.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.840]   The Wall Street Journal had the financial times have been pay long enough that no one,
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.400]   it's not ever...
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.760]   You cannot transition a free product to a pay product.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   I think you're right.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.280]   I think you're right.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:29.000]   He says the extended downturn has only increased the drum beat for change.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   We're going broke in other words.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.200]   Community journalism is not cheap in an industry that gives away its content is simply cannibalizing
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.800]   its ability to produce good reporting.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.200]   That's why we give away all these podcasts.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.480]   We believe in cannibalizing good reporting.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.920]   The increase we've seen in our Wall Street Journal subscription proves to me the market
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.960]   is willing to pay for that quality.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:55.280]   Well, but he's assuming that it's that he's offering the quality.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:00.240]   Like you, if he's going to say, okay, these are the 100 things that we're going to do to
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:05.040]   make the sun absolutely phenomenal and so much.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:08.320]   Head and shoulders better than any other subscription or any other newspaper that you
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.120]   will just be compelled to pay for it, then that's one thing.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:15.440]   But you can't just say like, hey, you know that water that used to come out of the tap,
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.360]   now it's like nine times more.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   But it's the same water.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360]   Like what?
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.360]   No, no.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.360]   No, that's a very good way to put it.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.200]   I think you're absolutely right.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.040]   You can't backtrack.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.040]   You can't backtrack.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.040]   You can't start.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.120]   I couldn't start charging for Twitter.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.120]   Everybody'd laugh at me.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.200]   Isn't Rupert around 100 years old now anyway?
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.920]   I mean, isn't he about to change the whole thing's going to change hands the next couple
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:35.920]   of years.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.920]   He doesn't really care.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.480]   But there still is the open question, right?
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.120]   Like, what are they going to do?
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.120]   What are they going to do?
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.120]   You're not going to do.
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.120]   You're not going to do anything.
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.120]   You're not going to do anything.
