[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.720]   We've got lots to talk about our video games to blame for the Florida shooting, the drone
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:21.520]   that caused a helicopter crash, the end of Facebook, and an amazing deal for a showrunner
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.520]   at Netflix.

[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.880]   It's going to be a bumpy ride.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.400]   Ian Thompson is here from the register dot go dot UK consistently Ian.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.320]   My congratulations consistently.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880]   The best coverage.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.200]   You just can't not read.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.600]   We have fun and some of the some of the headlines.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   Just awesome.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.960]   Yeah, they didn't like that.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.680]   Just awesome.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   You write your own.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.680]   I take it.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.080]   Well, I write my own, but I submit them to my editor.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.320]   I didn't change it.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.560]   Eight times out of 10, he will change it.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.160]   But occasionally you sneak one through and you get a feeling just like getting it.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.920]   Christina Warren is here.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.720]   Film Girl now at Senior Cloud Dev Advocate at Microsoft, but we decided that that does
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.920]   not in any way disqualify you from covering the industry.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.080]   If you wish to recuse yourself, if any cloud dev stories appear, you can.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   I doubt they will.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.880]   I know they won't.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.800]   But it's always a pleasure to have you, Christina.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.480]   And she's just love it because she's strategically placed that clueless movie poster to hide
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.240]   a multitude of sins.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.360]   Oh, it's so my office is so messy.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.360]   I'm so sorry.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   You're a worker at home.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360]   Is this your office at home?
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.800]   No, my work office actually, I should have done it there, but it's a long weekend.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   So I didn't.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   Next time we do this, I'll do it for my work office because I have a Wolf barrel elf stand
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.440]   up like a cardboard stand up that somehow found its way into my office.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.560]   I'm not really sure how somehow find its way in there.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   No, genuinely.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.080]   I walked in one day and it was there.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.520]   And so I'm keeping it and I'm trying to decorate it during every holiday to make it
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   festive.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.400]   So yeah, next time we do this, I'll do it for my office on campus.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.600]   I can't imagine a more appropriate home, frankly, for a Wolf barrel.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.120]   I'm just wondering where you're going to put the bulls on it with Christmas, but no.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.920]   We call them here.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920]   Balls.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.320]   Also with us.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.720]   He's a doctor and he's a happy man.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.480]   Oh, and JJ Stones.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   The Eagles.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   The birds.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.560]   I know it's a tech show, but we still see where the team is.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.560]   We fly.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   I hear these streets.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.440]   I've been embarrassed of my daughter with this hat every day.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.080]   She said, when you're going to start wearing a hat, I said, when the batteries die.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.880]   When the batteries die, he's wearing a Philadelphia Eagles baseball cap with a flying bird.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.160]   It actually flaps its wings.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   Yes.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.640]   relates to the Elmadropic contest that we had.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.920]   It's ice, blank green and it's it's walks.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.120]   I hear in these streets.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.720]   Actually there's a there is a there is a tech story about Tom Brady this week.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.320]   And not a good story, but it has nothing to do with Tom Brady.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.320]   A judge.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:59.040]   Oh, that has ruled that embedding a tweet with copyright material can violate copyright.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.720]   This was completely contrary to previous decisions in the ninth circuit court of appeals.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:13.720]   The federal judge in New York on Thursday said that nine news organizations had violated
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   copyright by embedding a tweet that included a picture of Tom Brady that was owned by somebody
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   else, Barry Chin from the Boston Globe.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.920]   No, that's just the picture.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.680]   Oh, I guess I guess the Hollywood people put it.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.000]   I didn't want to put the copyright picture in their article because they didn't want to
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   be named in the suit.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.840]   So that's somebody else's picture.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:42.560]   It was a image of Tom Brady and Kelthix general manager Danny Ainge and others on a street
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.480]   two years ago.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.400]   Justin Goldman, the photographer, uploaded the photo to Snapchat.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.960]   The photo went viral.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.520]   Others uploaded to Twitter subsequently.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.560]   These nine news organizations embedded the tweets with the image and stories about whether
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.440]   the Kelthix would successfully recruit Kevin Durant.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.600]   They better damn well not.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   But that's another story.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.760]   Well, yes, I mean, that's another story.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.400]   This is really set the cast amongst the pigeons with publishers because it's, you know, if
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.160]   embedding tweets and stories is now obviously a thing and it's kind of, you know, where
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.360]   do you go with this?
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.240]   Because if you get it wrong once, you can get sued to hell and back.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.520]   So this is the opinion from US district court judge Catherine Forris.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.360]   She wrote when the copyright act was amended in 1976, the words tweet viral and embed
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.840]   invoked thoughts of a bird, a disease and a reporter.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.560]   Nicely nicely put decades later.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.800]   She'd offer her a job at the registered decades later.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.480]   These same terms have taken on new meetings as the centerpieces of an interconnected worldwide
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.920]   web in which images are shared with dizzying speed over the course of any given news day.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:07:02.840]   She basically implies that embedding is something that coders do, that it is a elaborate thing.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   That's why Twitter provides the easy to use click button to do.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   Right.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.600]   Any options to embed either the video or the photo or the tweet, you can just embed the
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.880]   video or the photo.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.440]   She says the fact that the image was hosted on a server owned and operated by an unrelated
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:26.680]   third party Twitter does not shield the defendants from copyright violation.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:33.640]   Now in the past, the case that comes up again and again is the Ninth Circuit's judgment
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:40.520]   in perfect 10 versus Amazon.com, which was perfect 10 had images.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   I don't remember.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.840]   I seemingly remember it thumbnail images naked models appearing in Google image search.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   Right.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.640]   And then that's been the kind of case law, right?
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.640]   Yes.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.000]   Up until this point.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.040]   And they call that the server test.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.840]   So let me see if I can, the direct liability of a website publisher for copyright infringement
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.600]   turns on whether the image is hosted on the publisher's own service.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   In this case, it wasn't.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.040]   It was it was an embedded link of a tweet.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.480]   But she held that it was still copyright infringement.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.680]   Well, I've read the report and I'm not entirely clear on this.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.960]   Maybe everyone's going to help on this.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.360]   But I think the problem was that they'd used the image but taken not from the tweet of
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.880]   the person that had taken it, but from the Twitter.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.320]   Other people had just copied it.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.320]   Other people's tweets.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.280]   And I think if you take it from the original person, then you're in the clear.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.440]   But if you take it from something that's being--
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.600]   Well, but it was never on Twitter.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   It was on Snapchat.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   Ah, OK.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   OK.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   Well, that's OK.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.440]   Snapchat did not have an embedding feature.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.440]   No, no.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   OK, we'll do not.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440]   And maybe retweet it.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.160]   And maybe if you retweet it, you could skate getting in trouble because I didn't post
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.160]   first.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160]   I just retweet it.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.560]   Well, no, I think these are-- well, OK.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.560]   They're not retweets.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.560]   They're embedded tweets.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   But--
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.560]   Right.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   And I don't think that's so different.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.640]   And is it side note for the internet is the Celtics.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.800]   I've been waiting to correct you.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   Oh, I said Celtics.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.840]   It's the internet will destroy you all week for saying it.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.280]   They love something correct.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.040]   Even though Boston mispronounces it, the Celtics.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.040]   It's the Ki-Wai.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.040]   It's the Ki-Wash.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040]   It's Ki-Wash.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.640]   No, I know it's the Celtics.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.560]   I just like to troll people.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.560]   Just checking.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.360]   Trying to get a job in Russia.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   No, it should go.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.240]   So in this case, there was a Snapchat screenshot that was taken and then embedded.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.520]   Someone else embedded in a tweet.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.520]   And then the news publisher--
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.520]   People tweeted it.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.520]   Lots of people tweeted it.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   Right.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   Well, lots of people tweeted it.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.600]   That's interesting because I can kind of, I guess, maybe see the argument if it didn't
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.640]   originate as something that someone embedded originally on Twitter, even though it seems
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.280]   semantical, because for instance, you do see certain news organizations who have permission
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:57.200]   from wire services like the AP or Getty or Reuters or whoever to have permission to put
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.360]   those photos on social media.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.200]   When I worked at both Mashable and Gizmodo, we had those clauses built into our relationships
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.360]   with those places.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.880]   And we could say, definitively, you can use this image on just a post or you can use it
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.720]   on a post and on social media.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.960]   And so in that case, I would assume that because we had licensed permission to use that photograph
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.240]   if someone wanted to embed that tweet someplace, it would still be licensed.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.720]   Although, that's not really clear from this judgment.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.560]   But in this case, it seems like the original person who tweeted this didn't have a license
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.760]   to the image.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.840]   And therefore, anybody who subsequently embedded the tweet without a license, the judge is
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.800]   saying they're still violating copyright regardless of where it was hosted.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.080]   It's actually, it is very interesting.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.920]   She actually quotes the area case.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:53.720]   Remember, area was rebroadcasting local TV stations.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:00.280]   And their loophole was that, well, the user is renting a little nickel-sized antenna from
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.920]   us and they're watching only their own antenna.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.480]   And how did that go down?
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.920]   In the end, area lost.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.400]   I think it was the Supreme Court held that-
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   It did go to the Supreme Court.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.480]   And I covered that case from the beginning and yeah, they lost hard.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   So yeah, I mean-
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.560]   So, area's argument was it's not us, it's not our fault.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.560]   It's the user's violating.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.560]   Well, if you're not right, that did not hold water.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.200]   Christine, it really knows more on the, but it struck me that the argument was that we're
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.400]   just, we're doing whatever free public broadcasting does anyway.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   And we're just doing it on a larger scale.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.840]   Yeah, that was the area argument.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.160]   And the area argument wasn't even so much putting the onus on the users.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.360]   It was saying we have created this array and you are simply using your following-
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   standard over-the-air things.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.640]   It just so happens that the antenna doesn't reside in your physical home, it exists in
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.720]   a warehouse and in Jugger's season place or, or Gippin' Queens.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   I can't remember where it was now.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.640]   And that's how it's being transmitted, not so much that the users might be violating,
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.160]   you know, copyright or whatnot.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.640]   But I can understand why that case would be cited because their ultimate argument failed.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.560]   So she's saying it doesn't matter where it originates.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   Exactly.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   If you have a hosting content-
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.560]   It's server argument, it doesn't matter.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.760]   Which is, which is really scary to me.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.000]   I mean, putting aside whether or not people should, you know, because a lot of places,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.960]   a full disclosure, I'm sure that I've done this, have gotten around the fact that they
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.560]   didn't have rights to an image by simply embedding a tweet or a video of that image or video.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.000]   That's been a very common loophole.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.960]   We should point out this is not the end of it.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.320]   This was merely a motion for summary judgment.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.320]   Exactly.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.960]   And the judge rejected that and said, "No, no, you guys are going to trial."
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   And she pointed out that in fact there might be some legitimate fair use protections because
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.520]   she says in this case there are questions about whether the photographer effectively
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.400]   released his image into the public domain when he posted it to his Snapchat account.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.600]   Well, technically even with that, he put it on his Snapchat because he's like, "Look,
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.880]   it's going to be up here for a little bit, then it's going to disappear."
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.480]   So he was expecting it to come down and he was probably going to post it wherever else
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.480]   we wanted to later.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.040]   He was just in that moment because he put it on Snapchat.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.200]   Hey, everybody, just remember stuff doesn't disappear when somebody screenshot you stuff.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.960]   I do have some sympathy for the photographer because that's his image and he wants to sell
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.600]   it or he wants to make money off of it.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.960]   And all of a sudden these big publishers are just using it.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.080]   In effect, they're using it without permission to promote their products.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.080]   They're on content.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.280]   I kind of have some sympathy for him.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.320]   At the same time, you really do want to preserve the server defense because you don't want
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.120]   all of a sudden anybody who does a retweet.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.600]   Should I worry about retweeting?
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   Yeah, I'm not...
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.840]   Well, we've seen this with the Olympics, right?
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.780]   Like the Olympics and NBC and BBC and others are very, very stingy about what you can screen
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.940]   cap and what you can't.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.680]   And they will even take down people's personal photos and personal videos.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.000]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.960]   Somebody takes a picture of the lit up Eiffel Tower.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.760]   You can't copyright the Eiffel Tower, but you can't copyright the lights on it.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.760]   Paris has.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   Okay.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.240]   They assert the right to that picture.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.280]   Now, you took the picture, you posted on your Twitter account.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.840]   They could go after you, but if I retweet you according to this decision, they could
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   also go after me.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   Right.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.400]   Well, what I was going to say is what we've seen with the Olympics and we've seen with
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.920]   the NFL is that oftentimes, you know, tweets will be taken down and that people who do
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.520]   retweets, you know, sometimes I don't know of any instances where people's accounts have
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.280]   received strikes, but certainly, you know, if you've retweeted something and that tweet
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.680]   is taken down, then it's gone.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.920]   And it's been the same sort of thing where if you've been better to tweet, that is then
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.000]   taken down, that in bed goes away.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.320]   I guess my big thing with this, because I'm with you, I have sympathy for the photographer,
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.920]   I have sympathy for someone who's saying, I didn't license my photos to be used this
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920]   way.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.720]   It was taken by a party that wasn't licensed and now it's been embedded all over the place.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.160]   But you know, it does make it very difficult if you are a news organization or if you're
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.480]   an individual or if you're anyone to then say, well, how do I determine if the person
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.080]   who posted this had copyright or had permission to post this?
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.840]   Because presumably again, if you have a license with Getty or whoever or the photographer
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.360]   to post it on Twitter, then the terms of the in bed agreement should say, well, if I embed
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.440]   this on another site, this is allowed.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.560]   But how am I to know if you had the permission to do this or not?
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.760]   So I feel like it's a really slippery slope to then say, well, because you inserted this
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:18.840]   code that Twitter provides and basically very much promotes the people used, you're now
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.920]   going to be responsible for something when to me it should really be, okay, you know, you
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.680]   go to Twitter and you say, I didn't license this.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.280]   They take it down and then the embed stops working.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.640]   Like to me, that seems like the more fair solution rather than potentially having case
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.640]   law.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.280]   And as you said, this is just summary judgment rejection.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.880]   It's going to go to trial that they could put a lot of things in jeopardy.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.480]   And the judge said there are some affirmative defenses here.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.000]   I'm not throwing your case out.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.400]   I'm just saying Florida dude in the chatroom raises an interesting point.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.600]   Doesn't posting an image on Snapchat make that image a property of Snapchat?
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.520]   I think that there's a story.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.200]   If you look at the terms of conditions, it probably does.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.080]   They probably, are they going to have a full set?
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   I think it's a dual license.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   I think it's a dual license.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   Right.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   You own it still, but we now have the right to reuse it in other ways.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   Right.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.200]   And in fact, that was a big thing after Facebook bought Instagram that people were freaking
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.560]   out because there were terms of service and they were saying, oh, Facebook says they can
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.560]   do whatever they want with this, including using it now, or chisements or whatever.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.400]   And Facebook came back and was saying, no, we're really just saying that we could show
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.160]   this in your feed to say, people you might want to follow, we're not actually going
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:33.360]   to be using your stuff and ads, like traditional advertisements on TV and stuff.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.560]   But that was a big concern when Facebook bought Instagram that the users had is what's going
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.200]   to happen to my content.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.600]   So I'm sure that there are things within that agreement that basically give a license
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:49.480]   for it to be viewed and potentially Snapchat to do whatever they want to do with it.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:56.280]   But I don't know if that means that, for instance, if Snapchat had maybe posted a tweet with
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.240]   that image, then maybe that would be one thing.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.960]   But if a third party is screenshotting the image and has been posting it to Twitter with
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:10.200]   different service, I don't think that Snapchat could, I mean, maybe they could claim a copyright
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.600]   defense on behalf of the user.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.960]   But I don't think that it would be one of those things where you're giving up all your
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.960]   rights to your images.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   I think it's kind of a dual-licensed thing.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   Yeah, I can't help feeling that if you publish something on social media and people retweets
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   it, that's just, that's the point of social media.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.920]   I mean, I've taken a couple of photos which I've then had sent back to me.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.920]   Have you seen this?
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   It's like, well, yeah, I bloody took it.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.320]   But someone else has retweced it and that's the way it goes.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.040]   And it's as simple as that.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:45.000]   If you're a professional photographer, you've got the right to defend your images but get
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.320]   some kind of watermarking on it before you put it on social media.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.760]   It is not okay, however, to post this on Twitter.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.840]   Mark Hamill, apparently there were rumors going around that he had passed away.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.600]   Luke Skywalker.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:06.760]   So he posted on Twitter, Mark Hamill, 1951 to 2018, "Alive and well, #Don't rush me."
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.760]   He looks so much better without the bid as well.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.760]   That is getting too favors.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.440]   Yeah, the beard was not, but that, you know, it's a movie.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.880]   He's got to do something.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.920]   So we have kind of not mentioned and it's so sad I hate to even bring it up.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:24.640]   And yet it is a huge tech story, of course, I'm talking about the shooting, the horrific
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.840]   shooting in Parkland, Florida.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   But what I'm finding fascinating is how the students of the high school are going to Twitter
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.240]   and becoming activists.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:46.400]   And using Twitter, to organize rallies, to respond to Twitter pundits who are blaming
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:53.560]   everybody but the gun, it's really remarkable to watch these young people who grew up in
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.520]   a Twitter era use Twitter so effectively.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.160]   I think this is the way it's going to go.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.720]   This is how you're actually going to get some sensible change in this country because they're
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   sick of it.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.920]   We're not with shooting drills on the rest of it in a way that we never had to.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.440]   And they're understandably sick of it.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.280]   And it's about if they leave the charge, I'm with them.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.840]   It's kind of hard when you're reading statements from kids who were there, who were friend
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   boss friends.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.640]   Oh, you saw the Twitter conversation between the two brothers on the cell on different
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.640]   flaws and one of them was just like, "During the event, I'm sorry, I've never valid you
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.120]   enough in the rest of it."
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.920]   And the guy just responds, "My teacher's dead."
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.080]   And I saw that reading it and it was just like...
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.440]   That's when Twitter has some real import and some real value.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.640]   And then, of course, there's this side story that Russian-driven trolls are now invading
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.640]   Twitter.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.640]   We're going to have to get used to that.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.800]   It's going to be a feature for a while.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.280]   It's going to be a great disarray and discord.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:04.440]   And it's just in a nutshell, the Twitter story that it is both capable of amazing communication
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.520]   and information and at the same time, such a cesspool.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.320]   I mean, there was a...
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.800]   Well, okay, there was a tone deaf request to one of the students who was tweeting about
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.760]   it from a journalist from all that.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   It's only a lorry.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.760]   Organization.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   Just, "Oh, that's...
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760]   Oh, I'm not even going to go that."
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.880]   The pop filter doesn't cover spit that much.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.080]   No, I mean, a journalist called up and said, "Oh, you're in the school shooting.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.080]   Would you mind talking?"
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.360]   And it's like, "You know, slightly bigger things on my mind than mine."
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.120]   Actually, that was a four-chan...
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   I thought it was a hoax.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   Really?
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   That was a hoax.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   So there were some fabricate...
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.280]   This is another misuse of Twitter.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.000]   There was a journalist...
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Was it the Post?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.400]   I can't remember which newspaper she was looking for who had tweeted, but her tweets had
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:54.200]   were edited, modified, and then posted on Twitter to imply that she asked students
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.400]   if the shooter was black and if there were any pictures of bodies that they could...
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.200]   And these were fake.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.840]   And this is another problem, which is, of course, it's completely easy to fake this
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   stuff.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.240]   And that's another problem is you don't know whether you read...
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.840]   When you read something on Twitter, what its provenance is?
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.800]   Well, I think this is one of the key things Twitter's got to get sorted out is it's got
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.000]   to check sources in terms of where is this person posting from?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.240]   Are they using a VPN to do it from?
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.320]   That will allow people a much greater remit to decide whether or not what their reading
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   is worth reading.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:37.760]   You know, Owen, you're usually the voice of the people of reason.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.760]   What do you think?
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760]   Okay.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.800]   I was hoping you actually skipped me because it's too...
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.200]   Does it destabilize?
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.640]   No, it's not devastating.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.640]   People die every day.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.680]   And apparently, the people around the country don't care.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.680]   The kids die.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.360]   It's not private schools that are getting shut up.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.120]   So it doesn't really matter to them.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.760]   And it's great that these kids are doing...
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.080]   You always got misinformation.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.400]   My big thing about technology is the FBI had information.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.040]   This kid was posting dead stuff and doing all this stuff on the internet.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.120]   So that's the technology story that gets me.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.120]   They're out here.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.840]   The NSA, whoever it is, is combing all this information.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.320]   The Boston bomber.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.680]   I could go list on and on.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.200]   FBI had these people under surveillance, sent people out to their home to talk to them.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   And what do you do?
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.800]   Well, you know, he's messed up.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.640]   Yeah, but I will defend that.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.360]   That is the price we pay to be in a free society.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.440]   There are limits.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.560]   Now I think it is the case that the FBI bungled this one that they missed it.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.560]   They bungled a lot of them.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.560]   They missed it.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:43.840]   But at the same time, we don't live in a society where as soon as somebody says something like
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.120]   that or tweets something like that, he's thrown into jail and the key is thrown away.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.120]   I don't want to...
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   Okay.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.120]   I don't want to go into jail.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.160]   But if you go into the point where you go out and met this person, investigate this person,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.360]   then maybe you should go and provide that.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   They needed to do that.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   And they didn't know if they did that.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.840]   Then you need to go and provide some kind of help or some kind of program.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.320]   I know there's too many people, but this guy is somebody they had a large interest in.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.160]   He had people looking at him.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.920]   And apparently, you know, everybody's family passed away.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.000]   There has to be some kind of adult that you could talk to to get to understand what is
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.080]   going on in this person's head when these people are posting like that.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   I don't think it's ever...
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   One thing come to your radar...
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.840]   You're never going to have perfection in that.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.840]   I'm not out of the direction.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.840]   I'm not out of the direction.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   I'm not out of the direction.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.040]   Without having a society that is completely...
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.920]   It's exactly the opposite of the open society that we want to live in.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.760]   I think that is unfortunate.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.520]   I wish there were a better answer.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   Okay.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520]   So please suspend...
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   Let me...
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   Okay.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   Sorry.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   Let me finish.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   You don't...
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520]   I don't need perfection.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   You know the two things I need?
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520]   All the kids putting all this up great.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.720]   Go get money out of politics.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.160]   Go run for something.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.520]   You're going to build a says no outside money.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.280]   The government says here you're a senator.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.280]   You get 10 grand.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   You're a president.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.120]   You get 100 million dollars, whatever.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.520]   But the money has to come from us because outside money and I raise got the budget.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   They're never going to change it.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.520]   The second thing is...
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.280]   I know this is a tech show.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:07.680]   But about guns, the fact that I can get a gun easier than I can get a driver's license
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.760]   is something insane.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   Just to...
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.320]   The whole DMV and apply to guns.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.560]   You have to take a written test.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.600]   You have to take a test with a instructor to search you can shoot.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.600]   You have to go and renew it every couple years.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.560]   When you sell the gun, you have to have a bill of receipts and a purse you sold it to.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.880]   And they get taxes on it so they know where the gun went.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.920]   So you can't say 10 years later, oh somebody stole it.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.760]   I forgot to report it.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.080]   Just use the DMV as a guide for gun control.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.080]   I'm a gun owner.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   I love guns.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.080]   I love shooting guns.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.680]   But I'm just saying if you had real comments that people could still get their guns and
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   guns wouldn't disappear.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.360]   18 year olds wouldn't just be able to go buy a gun without anything.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.240]   It's just...
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.240]   It's annoying.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.760]   There's the governor of Kentucky who by the way, beat Drew Curtis of FARC who we were
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.760]   supporting.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:00.000]   Technically literate guy, Matt Bevin won in Kentucky and he blames violent video games.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Because you know...
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.760]   And I'm so tired of this.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.680]   You know, I was in high school when Columbine happened.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.920]   I was in college when Virginia Tech happened.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.360]   And I would have hoped that 19 years after Columbine that we would have been past this
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.680]   point where we're blaming media, we're blaming music or video games or whatever.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.160]   And we're actually looking at the problem which as you know, Doc dova saying is very
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.440]   largely easy access to firearms.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.880]   The fact that it's more difficult for me to get birth control pills than it is for
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.960]   someone to buy a gun is insane to me.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.360]   You know, I mean, forget about even the DMV thing.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.320]   It's literally harder to get, you know, contraceptives in this country than it is to get a firearm.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.560]   And that's nuts.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:44.440]   And the fact that the immediate place to go is blaming video games as if that's the problem.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.880]   When they're white ass shooters and video games, when it's a black kid that got shot with a
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.040]   hoodie on, he's a thug and he scares somebody.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.520]   I just, you know, I see again, the thing that cracks me up the most is the perception that
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.520]   they put on.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.520]   This kid was an upset kid.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.000]   You know, how's he a kid?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   He's 19 years old.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.480]   He just shot 17 people.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.920]   And my thing is too, he wants to get out of it.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.760]   Just execute the person.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.480]   You know, this what you want to do.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   You want to play crazy.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.480]   You want to be crazy.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   You do this.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   You die too.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   No, put them in jail.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.960]   I'm not spending $4 million for this guy.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.960]   It was 19 years ago.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.600]   And it cost more.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.120]   It costs more to execute him than it does to put him in jail for the rest of his life.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.120]   So if it's the dollar savings you're looking for, that's the wrong.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.560]   Apparently bullets are cheap, bro.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.560]   Bullets are 25 cents.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.560]   Diamond does.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.720]   Yeah, but you see, I know it works.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   Well, okay.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.400]   Hey, I mean, I don't know.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   17 people.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.400]   17.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   It's tempting.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.640]   But again, I think that there's something to be said for the rule of law in this nation.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:46.920]   And I think we are at this nation where we have certain, I think we revere certain freedoms.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:53.840]   And I don't think that I agree with you that it's odd that it's easier to buy a AR-15
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.320]   in Florida than it is to buy a handgun.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.840]   He was actually too young to buy a handgun.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.960]   Well, yeah, but I mean, he bought an AR-15 at the age of 18 and he had three years to go
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.760]   before he could even buy a beer.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.760]   That's just bonkers.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.760]   I agree with that.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.320]   Okay, he'd taken the AR-15 to either school or youth events.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.480]   I mean, that's what's insane to me is that people knew that he had these guns.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.880]   And I do think that people should be taking warning signs more seriously.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.880]   I don't think anyone's arguing that.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.920]   And there's no evidence he played a lot of video games as far as I know.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   No, there's not.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.920]   No, there's no.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   The whole video games don't give me place.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.920]   People want to go to.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   How old is this argument?
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:32.040]   It's like, what is this Tipper Gore in 1993 saying that blaming stuff on iced tea again?
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.600]   This is ridiculous.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.160]   There's never been any proven stuff going even back to Dungeons and Dragons being blamed
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.600]   in the 70s for cult stuff that was all a-
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:45.800]   Do you think though, in the larger argument, I'm not going to honor Matt Bevin with agreement,
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.360]   but in the larger argument, we do have a violent culture.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.360]   You have a-
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.600]   Okay, it's not about- let me- I don't know where he's reading, I'm sorry.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.680]   It's not about the video game violence.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.680]   It's not about any of that stuff.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.680]   You know what it's about?
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   It's about a girlfriend.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.400]   All these dudes are lonely.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   Nobody likes them.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   They're alone.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   They need to get a girlfriend program.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.080]   Forget them playing video games being violent.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.560]   A lot of kids are playing video games and happy every day shooting up stuff.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.080]   The dude is the guy who shot the church.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.000]   No friends, a virgin, never had a girl.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   That's the thing.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.400]   If you see a dude that's lonely, walk around with a gun, somebody go up and kiss him.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   That's how you stop this whole thing.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.760]   Because once you fall in love, your whole mind's said change.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.320]   But when you're alone and ain't nobody loves you, you get real squirrely.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   So go ahead, continue.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.200]   I'm sorry, but violence is not a problem in America.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   We've been violent.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:36.560]   But this is something as a foreigner coming into this country that you notice is really,
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.160]   really different about it.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.080]   Because the entire country freaked out over Janet Jackson's nipple.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.320]   You can turn on the TV and see people getting their heads blown apart left, right?
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.880]   Well, that's always with the economy here, right?
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.120]   Is that we are very afraid of anything that is sexual and nature.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   We're very prudish in that way, but we are very much embraced in violence.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.080]   And that is obviously the difference if you go to Europe where it's oftentimes the inverse.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.080]   But I do think that now...
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.080]   Long last day, so.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:06.000]   Yes, but I will say, and the studies have proven this, that gun violence is a uniquely
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.840]   American problem.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.560]   And that school shootings, especially like this, are a uniquely American problem.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:17.480]   And it's because we have more guns, even if you do it down to the number of population,
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.800]   you get the ratio correct.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.440]   And so, but it's something we haven't really embraced.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:28.000]   And when you look at video games and do we have violence media, of course we do, but
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   that hasn't really...
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.800]   There hasn't been any proven correlation in that.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.600]   The proven correlation has been access to firearms.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.400]   And that's why I get angry.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:44.920]   Again, like I said, I would have really hoped that nearly 20 years later, we wouldn't still
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:50.200]   be having kids scared and worried and having to have shooting drills.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.640]   And in this case, the shooter knew about the drills and kind of followed that protocol
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.280]   to make it even worse for people.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.280]   We shouldn't have to have kids who were in the school watching their teachers and watching
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.320]   their fellow students murdered have to be the voice of reason here, and yet they are.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:10.880]   And instead, the politicians want to talk about video games, which it's like...
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.600]   And as you said, Leo, there's been no proof whatsoever that he even played video games
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.000]   or was even obsessed with that sort of thing.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And but just the fact that it's easier for us to go there and in blame culture rather
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.480]   than to look at the root cause, which is to me, access to firearms, that it's really
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.480]   displaying.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.240]   I hope never to see this headline in the onion again.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   Oh, I'm not.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   Yet every time we...
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   Yeah, that's so true.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   It's so sad.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   It's so sad.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.200]   No way to prevent this as the only nation where this regularly happens.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.320]   Three years ago, my daughter was seven.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.480]   I made a video talking to her about active shooters.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.960]   My daughter knows what to do in a movie theater, she knows what to do in a school.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.640]   And people were like, "Oh, you shouldn't be talking to your kid about that.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.640]   You're crazy.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.640]   What's wrong with you?"
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.520]   And I'm sitting here looking at the clock light, "Well, at least my daughter knows what
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.640]   to do in an actor shooter situation."
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.000]   She knows what to do with that whole concert thing went down.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.800]   Like, we got a whole system.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.600]   I got firecrackers in my trunk.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   We go to the park.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   It wants to pop one off.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   No.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   Just to make sure she's aware.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   No.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   Come check my trunk right now, take my car.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.440]   You actually set up firecrackers to see what your daughter will do.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.440]   You're a holy cow.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.440]   That's sad.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.560]   I'm not Jason Bourne, but I'm not playing that.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   No, I know.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.720]   It's not sad that you do it.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.400]   It's sad that you have to do it.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.240]   I completely understand why you do it.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.160]   She just got done wrestling her last wrestling mattress today.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.080]   And guys are out there, "Why do you have your daughter at her wrestling?"
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.320]   I'm like, "Cause she learns wrist control and hip control.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.160]   And if anybody's trying to take you down, what do men do when they force women down?
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.160]   Ris hips."
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.240]   So I don't care what nobody else is doing.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   I'm raising a ninja.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   She can go ahead and take care of herself.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   Bravo.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.240]   I don't blame you at all.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.720]   I don't blame you at all.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.920]   It's just sad that you have to.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.320]   It's sad you have to be that way.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   Yes.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.800]   It's just weird that we had a mass shooting in the UK in the late 80s in Hungerford.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.680]   And we banged the band semi-automatix and a bunch of automatic shotguns after that.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.400]   Then we had the dumb planes shooting in the 90s and pretty much everything was banned.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.880]   And we haven't had a mass shooting since.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.560]   Now I'm not saying anything in Australia after Port Australia after Port Arthur.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.360]   I'm not a scientist, but it does seem to me there is a connection between people not
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.360]   shooting people.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.360]   Yeah, though I wonder-
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.440]   And people not having the guns shooting people.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.200]   I worry that we're so far down the road.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.680]   There are 42 million guns in the nation.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.680]   This is the problem.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.680]   America is special case.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.600]   You could ban guns outright right now.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.600]   It never happened.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.120]   But you've got to say you did it.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.800]   There's still so many guns out there.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   I don't know.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   I don't say ban.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:42.640]   Well, I'm just saying even if you did, I don't know if it would have any impact.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.040]   In the short term, no.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:48.720]   But I think if you go to, if you use the DMV example that you gave, you know, this is
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.840]   a long term process.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840]   There's no way you're going to-
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.640]   Yeah, we have to start doing something.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   You've got to start.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.640]   We have to start.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.000]   Babies, can I just think the violent culture, we have to consider that.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.840]   Look, I believe in the personal-
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.920]   I'm not saying you should ban video games or violent movies.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.960]   But I think we have to be, I think we should think about.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.520]   But if you look at the proportion of gamers per country, the Japanese are so far ahead
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.520]   of us in terms of playing violent video games.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.640]   They're much less fun than they're much less violent.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.040]   You can't draw a direct correlation between them.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.520]   Admittedly, yes, those of us who grew up with Pac-Man in the 70s and 80s did end up
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.280]   going around dark in clubs, gobbling pills and jumping around.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.080]   But that was another matter entirely.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.120]   But when it comes to blaming this on video games, I'm sorry.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   This is just a canard.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.760]   We've been through this before.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.400]   I've been reading Bill Gates' favorite book.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   But one of his own.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.400]   Well, Steven, he-
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.400]   No.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   Actually, no.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.840]   It's blogged about Steven Pinker's new book, which I haven't read yet, Enlightenment Now.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.800]   The case for science, reason, humanism, and progress.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.160]   But Pinker's previous book is called The Better Angels of Our Nature.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.080]   It makes a very compelling case that we are, in fact, getting less and less violent.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:06.840]   That compared to previous societies, even previous generations, you know, you had in
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.360]   every society up until the last century, you had roughly a one in 15 chance of dying
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   in a violent death.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.280]   And it's about a fifth of that now.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.720]   And also people have more kids in those days, so you could afford to lose a few.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.640]   That's why they had more kids, because you never knew.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.480]   You know, half of them going to die in childhood.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.360]   However, we still feels like it's too violent of a culture.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.360]   And it just breaks your heart.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.520]   Hey, Uncle Leo, you know, our slavorous violent, getting rid of Indians is violent.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.640]   The British are coming is violent.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.320]   The crack epidemic in the 80s is violent.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.920]   I mean, dude, there's been violence, you know, segregation was violent.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.920]   This is Pinker's point though.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.320]   I'm just saying, video games and this now era, this is total.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.320]   You can't bully nobody.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.320]   You can't, nothing.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.400]   This is the least violent America we can talk about right now.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.200]   So in perspective, that's exactly his point.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.000]   And it's hard to, you know, it feels very violent, but at the same time, it's not historically
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.760]   we're sitting here talking about tech on a Sunday.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   Thank God.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.760]   Yeah, thank God.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.760]   Yes.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.640]   And we're going to move on.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:18.040]   But I have to say it's as every time I go, I hate Twitter, I wish Twitter would go away.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   Then things like that happen.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:26.280]   I mean, there were people, there were people tweeting children in the classroom saying,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.200]   yeah, this happened to me 10 years ago.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.400]   Keep your head down, stay quiet.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   You're going to make it.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.440]   It's going to be okay.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:37.680]   They were communicating during the shooting via Twitter.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:44.360]   I don't know what to make of it, but all that can is observe is we live in interesting
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.360]   times.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.320]   That's yes, both the blessing and the curse, unfortunately, but you know, it's.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:57.040]   And then the story that the Russians have mobilized their internet trolls to get in there on the
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   Twitter.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.920]   We're going to have to deal with this because this is going to be a feature now of social
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.640]   media until a stop is put to it somehow.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.640]   How?
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.320]   Hey, there's no big bucks for that.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:16.560]   But as I think you all know, the indictments that came down on Friday from Robert Mueller
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:25.880]   and the Russian investigation indicted 13 Russian nationals for basically for years,
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:35.920]   not even just 2016, but going back to 2014, trying to sow discord confusion in our politics,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:44.080]   not just our politics using fake accounts, troll accounts set up by with stolen identities
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.680]   from real Americans and even charging people to use their fake sites.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:55.880]   I mean, I never thought this up was just the internet research agency KGB Jiu Jitsu thinking
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.440]   you know, just incredible.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:07.920]   Facebook says 126 million Americans may have been exposed to material that internet research
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.000]   agency, the Russian agency created.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.440]   That was last fall.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.440]   Twitter admitted that many hundreds of thousands.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.000]   Well, they said thousands.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.040]   I think it's probably money hundreds of thousands of fake accounts.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.280]   All of them look real.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.960]   All of them look like they're real Americans.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.360]   I don't know how you would tell the difference.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.400]   It's kind of stunning, although as you pointed out before the show, it's not like we don't
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.720]   have a long and rich history in the United States of influencing other trying to get
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.200]   me to pull to politics.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.680]   It's maybe it's the game as it's played.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:46.000]   But you do have to wonder what the culpability is of Mark Zuckerberg and of Jack Dorsey of
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Twitter, Facebook.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.400]   Oh, desperate to avoid any any semblance of culpability.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.760]   And I'm sorry that that that that dog went on.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.000]   I mean, I've been down at Microsoft, sorry, Facebook briefings where they've been like,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.680]   we want to be the front page of the daily newspaper internet.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.200]   And with that comes responsibility to make sure that stuff you're putting on the front
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.680]   page is real.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.600]   You know, as journalists, we get sued.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.000]   We get for libel if we get that wrong.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.160]   Facebook just, oh, we're a platform.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.160]   It's not our responsibility.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   We're a platform.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   That's why I thought that speaks a wired article, the cover story on Wired from a white
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.600]   deal we'll see in Nick Thompson was so good because it really kind of highlighted the internal
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.920]   struggle that Facebook has had for many years now.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.400]   But it really covered the last two years of are we a media company or are we a platform?
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.600]   And like you, Ian, I've had many conversations with people at Facebook on their news teams
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.960]   where they've kind of wanted to have it both ways.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.760]   And what I thought was really interesting though is that Facebook has only started to
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.520]   even kind of investigate and maybe even take ironically a hands off approach, which only
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.960]   leads to more of this confusion because they're so afraid of regulation.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.480]   They're so afraid of regulators stepping in and saying, okay, you have to be responsible
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:59.080]   for some of the stuff that is happening on your platform and some of the way information
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   is spreading.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:06.200]   And they're so afraid of getting into any of that that the response has been to simply
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:13.440]   say, oh, well, we don't have any control over this, which obviously is BS because as their
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:20.200]   own investigations have proven, they should have known when Russians were making ad buys.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.120]   For these, you know, although I have to say now after these indictments, it's clear that
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.360]   the Russian ad buys were coming from what looked like American companies, American people.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   Well, yes, but in some cases, they weren't.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.120]   And some of them were immersibles, yes.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   Right.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.280]   And so the fact that, you know, a company that is is data driven as Facebook, which is
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.360]   one of the most data driven companies on the planet, doesn't have things to kind of look
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.640]   at and say, wait a minute, is this makes sense that someone paying in rubles is, you know,
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.600]   buying an ad buy to go to East Texas?
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   Is that odd?
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   Um, is interesting.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.800]   Well, one thing Facebook's resisted, and I wish they would give up this resistance, although
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.920]   they haven't yet, is identifying who buys the ads.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.760]   You buy a radio or television ad in this country for a political candidate.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.120]   You have to say who you are, who's paying for this ad and digital ads don't have that
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   requirement.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.120]   No, they do.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   That's the future.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.760]   And Facebook lobbied hard to keep that from being enforced for years.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.760]   Oh, yes.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   The actual costs for them.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.320]   But people has as well because it's all about automation.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:20.960]   So the whole way that their ad system works is to be automated, is, you know, to not have
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.960]   the middleman.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.120]   That's the entire point of double click.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.720]   That's the entire reason that the industry is what it is.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:31.160]   And that's why you get malware and Bitcoin miners and YouTube ads and all sorts of...
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.040]   I mean, I'm sorry, for Facebook to actually absolve themselves the responsibility of this
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.040]   is just pitiful.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:41.520]   I mean, seriously, anyone else, you broadcast something online, you are responsible for
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.520]   it.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.320]   Just saying, well, you know, we're just a social media platform.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.240]   We can't be held responsible.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   What could we do?
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.720]   We only made how many billions was it last quarter?
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.160]   You know, they couldn't actually afford to check the facts they're putting out there
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   are correct.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.160]   This is rubbish.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.560]   Well, and I think beyond that, I mean, their algorithm determines the order in which
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.560]   you see things, right?
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.960]   So I think you could almost have an argument that if they were to place everything in
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.400]   a timeline that was...
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   Comological.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   Exactly.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.920]   You could almost say, I mean, I would still think that it was rubbish as you say, Ian,
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.160]   I would agree with you, that there's still...
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.160]   It's BS.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:19.200]   But you could make the argument that if it was a chronological timeline and the algorithm
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:25.840]   isn't determining and highlighting or low lighting what you see and where you see it,
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   that that would be part of it.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.840]   But they control the algorithm.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.120]   They are controlling what gets more attention and what doesn't.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.680]   And if you're going to do that, I think that you also have a responsibility to make sure
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.560]   that the things you are highlighting that you are emphasizing the feed are accurate or
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.560]   interact with.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:46.240]   Going forward, really, the bottom line of all of it is, is crime doesn't stop it, just
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.240]   gets smarter.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.800]   So are they culpable?
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   True story.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   But going forward, guess what?
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.560]   You're going to have shell companies, American companies.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:58.080]   They're going to be sending people over and having to use their Visa for like three weeks
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.280]   set up one of those $20 bank accounts I was talking about and do their ads going about
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.280]   their business.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:10.560]   I mean, I just don't know how you stop it, even when you're trying now to look at it
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.880]   deeper because again, now these indictments went down.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.320]   They're like, okay, they got on.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.120]   All right, now we have to do it this way.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.840]   And when they do it the other way, then it's circumvent all the stuff that we just trapped
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.600]   them on and we're looking at, we're thinking about what we should be doing with them.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.120]   So we'll see what happens with it going forward.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.120]   It's very interesting.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:35.800]   Take a break, have more with Owen JJ Stone, oh, doctor from IQMZ.com Christina Warren film
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   girl.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.200]   She works at Microsoft now and developers relations.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.720]   Great to have you always great to see you, Christina Warren.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:51.040]   And of course, Ian Thompson from the register.co.uk our show today brought to you by WordPress.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:56.520]   You know, there is one, there is one antidote to all the crap online.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.440]   Find some good stuff online.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:03.240]   Tell people about your point of view, your thoughts, your business with WordPress.com
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.200]   couldn't be easier to make a website, whether you're looking to create a personal blog,
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.680]   a business site or both.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.080]   WordPress.com helps others find you, remember you and connect with you.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.280]   I think really in some ways I've felt this way for a long time.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:25.640]   We all almost have a responsibility to share our unique point of view online to make the
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.960]   internet a better place.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:32.920]   And you can do that so easily and so affordably at WordPress.com plan started just $4 a month.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.720]   You don't need any experience.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.920]   You don't need to hire someone WordPress.com guides you through the entire process from
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.920]   start to finish.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.480]   If you have questions, they have a great customer support team.

[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:06.120]   social sharing means people will tell the world about what you're saying.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.600]   I've been a strong believer.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.400]   It's fine to have a Facebook page and a Twitter account, but you need to have a place that's
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.720]   yours that you call your own on the internet with your domain name.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.440]   You get it all at WordPress.com.

[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.560]   We thank you for your support of this week in tech.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:10.680]   Helicopter crashes, according to the FAA, after maneuvering to avoid DJI phantom.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:19.320]   It's called a Robinson R22 helicopter.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.920]   It's a basic training light helicopter.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.400]   Instructor and student flying instructor told police, the student was practicing hover taxi
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:38.160]   maneuvering over rough ground on Daniel Island, which is near Charleston.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.320]   They saw a white DJI phantom quadcopter headed towards him.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:48.520]   He took control of the helicopter to evade the drone, but the tail rotor struck a tree.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.600]   He got the hilo down onto the rear of its landing skids, but it turned over.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.240]   I don't think anyone was seriously hurt.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.240]   No.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   Please fly responsibly.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.240]   That's great.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.240]   I mean, this is what scares me.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.960]   I've actually been looking at getting one of the Mavic errors, the newest DJI drone.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.960]   I love my Mavic Pro until I flew it into the ocean.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.960]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.280]   You should be allowed to fly anything ever again.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.480]   Well, I used to fly and let the kids fly.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.480]   I agree.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.480]   I'm not buying anymore.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.600]   I almost bought this drone.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.520]   This is the skydio.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.400]   It's an AI powered drone.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.160]   You don't even get to fly it.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.160]   I'm a skeptic.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.200]   You don't even get to fly it.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.320]   It's the it's it's an AI powered quadcopter.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.480]   It shoots 4k video.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   You tell it.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.480]   Follow me.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.480]   Lead me.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.480]   Surround me.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   I can't hit anything.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.760]   It has 13 onboard cameras.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.360]   Does real time mapping path planning obstacle avoidance?
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.760]   It's got an NVIDIA Jets and TX one computer in it.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   The brain.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.120]   In fact, many self-driving car systems use something similar.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.480]   And then it just flop.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.040]   And now this is a Verge review.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:04.280]   They did a demo in John McLaren Park in the city.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.280]   And it worked.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.280]   Didn't you?
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.280]   Should I get this $2,500?
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.080]   You buy it when you fly it into the river.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   You owe me one.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.920]   Because no matter what you do, anything that flies, it's going to die.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   You get across the--
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.920]   I still sign that.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.520]   But maybe you should, Christina.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.520]   Maybe I'll try.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.520]   I don't know what's interesting.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   And I don't know if this was the case here.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.640]   But you know, the DJI, the the Mavic Pro has obstacle avoidance.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.400]   But I believe it only works.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.720]   It doesn't work when it's in sport mode.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.080]   So I don't know if it wasn't in sport mode or if it--
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.080]   Well, it also doesn't work if something's behind it.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.080]   It only works forward.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.640]   It only works going forward.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.640]   And I actually got the thing.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.480]   I was on a-- my mistake.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.880]   I was on a boat, a catamaran in the heavy wind.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.480]   And I thought, this would be a great time to fly my drone.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.680]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.080]   And I'm struggling to keep this thing.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.280]   And then it hits the railing on the cat,
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.680]   goes right in the ocean.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   It was like--
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.560]   Yeah, that's not-- I mean, I'm kind of skeptical about this.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.880]   8 is 2 and 1/2 grand, which is a lot of my expensive--
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.880]   That's what stops me.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.480]   But also, we've just heard that it--
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   Kevin Durant is an investor.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.480]   Well, I'm like 18 lawyers.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.480]   Oh, oh, well, actually, everything.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.080]   I mean, I'm sorry, we've got one gin.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.240]   And I love some of what the Verge does,
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.600]   but they are a bit of a cheerleader
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.080]   rather than an absolute critical ice.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.680]   Yeah, everything they review is awesome.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.880]   So Christina, you're still going to get the Mavic?
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.880]   I'm thinking about it.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.480]   But this is what worries me is, is that--
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.680]   I need to see what the rules are in Washington,
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.080]   how much of NFA I think I would get.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.480]   I know there are definitely more places here
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.480]   that I could fly a drone without--
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.880]   You're not supposed to fly over people.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.880]   You're not-- Right.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.480]   You know, I mean, there are rules.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.080]   I followed all the rules.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.680]   Well, and everyone breaks the rules as it's clear by this case.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.680]   But this is what kind of scares me about these things,
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.480]   is that I think we're only going to see more of them
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   as they get less than enough.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.280]   The DJI says, you know, if you're near an airport or anywhere--
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.480]   Oh, you're not supposed to.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.480]   I mean, you can't fly it.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.480]   How did you-- How did he--
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.280]   How did he fly into a helicopter?
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.880]   Like, you didn't see the helicopter and think,
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.880]   oh, I need to back the thing up.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.080]   No, much more likely the guy was messing with him, right?
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.280]   I wanted you to get a close up shot.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.480]   But I mean, flying helicopters is really tough.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.880]   You know, you've got to control not only the rudder,
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.080]   not only the direction, but also the throttle controls
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:23.880]   that you've got your height.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.880]   You've trying to manage three things at once.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.480]   And then some bugger thinks it's a good idea
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.080]   to fly a drone in your face to get a good photo.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.680]   This drone in this video, if you're watching,
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.560]   is flying completely autonomously.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.000]   Nobody's flying it.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.680]   It's following the runner.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.800]   Who's wearing a very bright shirt.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.200]   It actually uses the color.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.680]   No, it says it uses the color to find her.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.360]   And it's flying through trees and branches.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.000]   I couldn't do this.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.760]   I couldn't do that either.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.760]   No, I couldn't either.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.080]   It was a crash without a doubt.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.680]   It's hard to-- it's not easy to fly a drone.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.000]   You've got to practice in an open territory for a lot.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.280]   And then don't get cocky.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.480]   Essentially, I was talking to some people from NASA
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.760]   and they're working on the air traffic control system
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.040]   for drones, which is going to be introduced later on.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.840]   Hopefully, if they have such to get the funding
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.080]   to finish the job.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.320]   But they want to basically build like an ATC system
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.680]   for drones, which seems perfectly sensible.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.240]   You'd have to get cleared and all that.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.600]   Yeah, well, you just have to have a chip in there that says,
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.240]   I am here.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.280]   Don't hit me.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.800]   And that way you can warn anyone else,
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.880]   if there's someone else around.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.120]   That's actually a good idea.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.600]   Because we're going to see these things that the numbers are
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.200]   only going to increase.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.640]   So let's just get in there and make sure it's safe first off.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.280]   Above all else, keep them away from airports.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.520]   I'm not a no-brainer.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.080]   The Mavic can follow you too, by the way.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:38.440]   Oh, I know.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.440]   I did a great job.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:39.720]   I know.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.240]   It's really impressed.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.160]   Christina, you could get one.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:41.760]   I trust you.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.840]   You survived a bus.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.080]   You could fly a drone.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.000]   OK, fair enough.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:45.560]   OK, fair enough.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.960]   I just tried the bus.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:47.560]   Yes.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.400]   I have complete faith in you.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.560]   Uncle Leo, I just heard-- every time he says drone,
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.400]   the following sentence is, it crashed in the doghouse.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.680]   It crashed in the ocean.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.920]   It crashed in the shower.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.440]   I'm like, dude, what do you do with the drone?
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.160]   I want to try to throw the house.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.320]   No drone, dude.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.960]   I did crash in the studio, actually.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.360]   So much money on drone.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.560]   You're killing me, Smalls.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.760]   Yeah, no, I'm done.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.720]   I'm done.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.960]   I almost bought the new-- with that new DJI Mavic.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:14.920]   What do they call it?
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:15.760]   I want the air.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.240]   I want it really bad, but I can't justify it.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:18.960]   I can't justify it.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.920]   I'm going to get one.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.560]   I think I'm going to get one, because it's only $800.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.680]   And I'm like, well--
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.560]   You've never had a drone before, Christina?
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.040]   I haven't.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.800]   I've used them before, but I've never had my own.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.160]   So just--
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.080]   You should totally get it.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.320]   Christina, the one thing about the air
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.840]   is that it uses Wi-Fi.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.120]   It doesn't use a radio signal like the pro does.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.080]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.040]   No, the pro is better.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:40.400]   I guess that's--
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.520]   Get the pro, Christina.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.280]   A little bit more.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:42.800]   Get the pro.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   Yeah, you'll be happier.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.160]   OK.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.840]   And it does also-- it lands itself,
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.920]   unless you're on a catamaran and a high wind.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.400]   It--
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.200]   And it alerts you that it's high wind.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.240]   As soon as you go up--
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.040]   I mean, not that you couldn't see the clouds moving.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.640]   Not that you couldn't see the wind on your face.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.200]   No, it told me.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:57.680]   And you got hair.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.600]   You know when your hair's--
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.080]   No, it told me.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:51:59.920]   That's a problem.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.760]   What are you doing?
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.880]   It said-- it actually said, Leo, this is a terrible idea.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:04.600]   I know it did.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.000]   It told you specifically.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Don't turn me on.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:07.840]   And what did you do?
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.200]   No.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.120]   Click the button anyway.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:09.960]   What I was thinking.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.400]   You're just going to-- I mean, it's the basic rule of sailing.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.240]   If you think you've got to reduce your sail area,
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.200]   you know, reef the main.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.320]   Reef the sheets because--
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:18.120]   Reef the main?
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:18.840]   Do you--
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.720]   You reduce the main.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:23.760]   If you're having to think that the wind might be too strong,
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.760]   just reduce the sail area.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.160]   That was the problem.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.720]   I was saying, what button do I use to reef the main?
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.280]   I don't--
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.640]   I don't even--
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.400]   I can barely-- I loved that drone, too.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.040]   It was really-- you will love it.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.640]   Get the mavic crow.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.400]   Will you really get it out of the throat?
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.440]   No, I wasn't with Lisa.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.520]   That's why I got into trouble.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.120]   That's why I went ocean.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:41.840]   That was--
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.240]   When I first got it--
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   I told you put it down.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.200]   And by the way, the other thing you're going to like about this
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.160]   is it folds up, which is nice.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.760]   You could pack it in your-- actually, you can do that
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.600]   with a new one, too, right?
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.240]   They fold together.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.320]   The new one's even smaller.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.000]   That's why I was interested in the new one.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.320]   I was thinking it was a little bit tiny.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.560]   The remote-- the battery and the distance
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:01.800]   are hugely the difference in why you want the pro over the air.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.760]   The pro's so cool.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.120]   And the great image is-- oh, I was so happy with it.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.840]   I mean, this new one, you get 16 minutes--
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.640]   was it 16 minutes battery life?
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.080]   That's not a long--
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.000]   Which is 12 minutes.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.160]   Which is 12 minutes.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.320]   With a huge for a drone.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:13.800]   Right.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:14.760]   Right.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.680]   Anything they say take off seven minutes.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.800]   When they tell you 30 minutes, you get--
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.880]   Yeah, but you don't have four.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.760]   It literally doesn't come with a remote control.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.160]   You don't have to steer it.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:24.960]   It just does it.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.040]   You throw it in the air and it just follows you around.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.600]   I would like to see a large number of reviews of this.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.480]   I'm highly skeptical.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.320]   Oh, wait.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.160]   Oh, wait.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.360]   The Mavic Air is even better if you can spend more money.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.360]   That's true, Comptor.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.160]   You're absolutely right.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.040]   It's 4K.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:39.720]   4K?
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.560]   Some of them go mortgages for crocane.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.080]   Oh, you know, though, it's so cool to see
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:49.120]   this stabilized footage above your house.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:52.360]   You see stuff from an angle you've never seen.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.400]   And it's beautiful.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.160]   And then it-- I mean, it's so fun.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.400]   I really-- I missed my drone.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.520]   And you know, I should have dived in
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.960]   because I paid for the refresh thing that DJI does.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   Even if it gets wet, I could have gotten a new one.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   You should have died in.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.120]   I should have died in.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.880]   I was going to say to drive itself under the waves and sank.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.920]   Well, it sank right away.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.080]   I don't think it needed to drive itself anywhere.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.920]   You could have got some ice.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.720]   Maybe some kind of gear and go pick it up for you.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.680]   My son wanted to.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.120]   I said, no, no, it's all right.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.120]   No, because then you could have recovered the footage
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:23.920]   potentially.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.760]   And that would have been--
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.320]   Oh, mad about it.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.880]   It needs a small air bag on it for--
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.680]   if you're going to be using it on the water.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.760]   It hits the water--
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.520]   Oh, right.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   That's what we need.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.200]   That's the next innovation.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   It's waterproof drone so that when you crash it in the water--
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.000]   Or you could have tried a fishing line to the foot
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.600]   and just let it ride and then re-load it in.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:40.960]   But I'm just saying, doesn't either here
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.120]   or no, because it doesn't matter.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.480]   Leo's never buying another drone.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.720]   No, that's it.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.120]   I came really close to buying that artificial intelligence
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.480]   one and I thought, oh, doctor would get mad at me.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.640]   20-- I'll be getting $2,500 mad at you.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   I know you're writing all that.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.160]   You know what I did buy.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.120]   But you can't do it.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.240]   I bought a HomePod.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.400]   That was equally stupid.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.200]   Yeah, I did too.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.520]   What did you put it on?
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.840]   Are you returning yours?
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.080]   Why?
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.680]   It's garbage.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.720]   It sounds great.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.240]   It sounds fantastic.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.760]   For my use cases-- and I am an Apple Music subscriber,
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.000]   but I also subscribe to Spotify and other things.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.680]   For my use cases, I can't justify $350 for a speaker
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.400]   that only works with Apple Music, that I
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.360]   have to use AirPlay for everything else, which
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.040]   is a pain that doesn't have multi-room until some date
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.000]   to be dismissed.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.720]   I bought the Sonos One set.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.520]   I've had Sonos stuff for years and I bought the two pack--
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.240]   I would say a dual stereo Sonos One
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.720]   is going to be better than a single HomePod.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.240]   They are.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.600]   And that was actually why I bought the HomePod.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.280]   I was really annoyed with reviews I was reading
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.160]   and people weren't comparing them head to head the way
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:43.920]   I wanted them to.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.400]   So I'm going to do my own review.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   I wanted to have a--
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.360]   You miss working for Mashable, don't you?
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:49.840]   I do.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:50.360]   I do.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.360]   I just can't do that.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.280]   So I was like, screw it.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.480]   I'm just going to do this myself.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:59.240]   And no, I think that for most people getting two Sonos One's,
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.440]   which together $350 is better than the HomePod.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:06.640]   Now look, in the future, if SiriKit supports other services,
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.520]   if you can do other things with it, great.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.880]   But that's not now.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.920]   And even though I think the sound is excellent, for me,
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.840]   I can't justify $350 for a speaker that literally plays
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.840]   Apple Music, and that's it.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.280]   I just can't justify it.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:24.480]   It's a very Apple thing to do to make a speaker that only plays
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.080]   Apple Music.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.760]   And the thing is, is that in some eras,
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:29.960]   that would have been fine.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.960]   That would have been OK.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:35.000]   But I feel like people, to me, they kind of argue with me
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.720]   comparing it to, oh, when the iPhone came out, people said this.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.280]   When the iPod came out, people said this.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.960]   Apple people are amazing, aren't they?
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.480]   Well, they are.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:46.280]   And I consider myself more deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.520]   than in the other ecosystem.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.960]   And I'm rejecting it.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:49.640]   And I'm saying, no.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:50.600]   And the iPod came out.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.000]   It worked with MP3s.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.720]   And you could-- it really took off when
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.800]   you could connect it to Windows.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.720]   And the iPhone had a web browser, even though it didn't
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.600]   have apps at first.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.400]   And those things made it really useful,
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.480]   no matter what you were doing.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.600]   In this case, even if you like Apple Music, and I do,
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.400]   you probably have other types of things you want to listen to.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:15.680]   And this is so limited right now that it doesn't work for me.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.840]   And the difference is, is that in some cases,
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.600]   if they had come out with this a couple of years ago,
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.320]   and you didn't have ecosystems that were good,
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.840]   and you didn't have a high quality audio speaker like the Sonos
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.000]   one that was about the same--
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.800]   it was less expensive or are two packets of the same price,
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.400]   you could maybe say, OK, we'll find, this gives me
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.600]   a slightly better experience.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.280]   But the reality is, is that these other systems
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.080]   are more advanced.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.360]   Their assistants are better.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.720]   They do more things.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.440]   And they work with more music services.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:46.880]   So the only reason you buy this is because you either really
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:51.360]   love everything Apple or you've been convinced that the audio
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.800]   quality is so much better, that that's worth it for you.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.080]   And I would say that for most audio files,
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.800]   this isn't going to be the sort of thing that would make--
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.400]   an audio file is going to want to line in Jack.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.800]   They're going to want to be able to play.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.400]   Exactly.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:05.920]   Exactly.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.320]   So even when they go to you about the audio is better,
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.760]   I can't hard line in.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.400]   There is a huge difference.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.200]   You can't even Bluetooth to the thing.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.160]   I need Google.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.920]   I'm convinced that Google is just winning the game as far as,
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.520]   you know--
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.640]   You think they're going to--
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.720]   --assistant and the sound.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.520]   They want my heart.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.480]   And I'm a jerk.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.000]   It's interesting because both Consumer Reports and David
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.160]   Pogue and when we did it here with Jason Howell
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.600]   with a blind taste--
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.240]   a blind sound test.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.720]   In all three cases, the Google Home Max one,
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.080]   and which frankly I disagree with, I don't think it's better.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:44.400]   But for some reason, Consumer Reports, David Pogue,
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.160]   Jason Howell all thought it sounded as good as--
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.320]   --it's going to be right there with you.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:47.840]   --if not better.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.400]   So and it's got the assistant.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.600]   It's got to line in.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.360]   It's got--
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:51.880]   You can use your--
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.480]   The line in makes a huge difference.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:55.400]   I don't know how you don't tell the difference.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.520]   But it makes a huge difference.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.120]   I did solve the problem though with getting the white--
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.000]   you know, if you put--
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.800]   --because it's got a silicone base.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.200]   If you put it-- have you tried that?
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.520]   Did you put it on wood?
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.800]   I did, but my wood isn't that expensive.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:08.640]   So it's a bit better.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.200]   Yeah, cheap wood.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.240]   I solved it because I put it on top of a Sonos.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:11.720]   Wood joke.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.520]   And if the Sonos doesn't mar the Sonos.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.000]   Oh, no, the Sonos does.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.440]   No, the Sonos mar is the wood.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.280]   But the--
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:18.800]   Oh, OK.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.040]   --old pot on a Sonos doesn't mar the Sonos.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:21.600]   It's just--
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.840]   I'm feeling terribly old-fashioned about this,
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.360]   because I've got a stereo, which I turn on--
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.440]   It's by the way.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.120]   And I put my home pot in the middle of my stereo,
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.360]   you know, left-right speakers.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.840]   Actually, I was surrounded by a sub.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.200]   And I switched back and forth, and I asked my wife,
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.680]   I said, sit down.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.920]   It's not even close.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.280]   It's not-- yeah, it's the God speaker, but it's even close.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:43.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.320]   I want a subwoofer behind my sofa.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.160]   You want a sub you want left-right?
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.840]   But we'll have to write them.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.640]   Don't listen to music that way anymore.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.680]   It's music as wallpaper.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.680]   And this makes me a little bit sad.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.120]   But music has become a soundtrack for your life,
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.480]   as opposed to something I'm an old guy.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.440]   I used to put on the cost 8 gig.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.440]   840.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.440]   I just put a CD from the rack.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   And that's a listen to that.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.680]   CD, I'd have the album liner, the record--
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:12.040]   Final, and I'd be lying on my back, listening on the headphones.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.200]   That's my generation.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.560]   We would listen to music.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.400]   But now, I think the current-- that may have
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.040]   sounded like an old man, but I think currently--
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.200]   You are an old man in living a bubble.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.280]   Every time I say this on the show, people tell me
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.400]   that it's not real.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.600]   But I got a 3,000-watt south system in my car.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.360]   And people say it's not real.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.320]   So I got to put it up on Instagram so you can see it.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.560]   I got 3,000-watt's bumping.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.480]   I can tell it's a hard line.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.920]   It sounds better, right?
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.320]   And see, it doesn't sound better, Uncle Leo.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.400]   It feels better.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.320]   People say to my car, they're like, why do you do that?
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.520]   They sit in the front seat.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.440]   They sit in the seat and they get on the side.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.400]   So you listen--
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.960]   Because you're listening to music
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.680]   as opposed to having music just play all around you
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.160]   as an ambient thing.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.480]   I'm feeling the music.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.680]   Oh, Leo, I can feel it in my soul.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.240]   How many watts?
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.440]   Feel it in my fingers.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440]   3,000?
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   Wow.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   I'm shaking.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.960]   Do you have a sub in your trunk?
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.160]   Are you one of those guys?
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.440]   I got two 12-inch subs in my trunk.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.440]   Oh, my god.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.840]   I got updated infinity speakers in my doors.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.440]   I was like, 1,500 watts go to the inside of the car.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.440]   1,500 watts go to the inside of the car.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440]   Look out for this.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   Max out.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   It's a Hyundai Sonata Turbo.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440]   OK.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440]   So it's nice.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.440]   You drive down the front seat.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.640]   You drive down the front and drop the back seat.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.160]   And you can hear the thumpin' as you go down the street.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.680]   This is how good it is.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:28.520]   You can hear me on a summer day six blocks away.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.680]   That's how I'm going to bring that up.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.600]   Six blocks.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.120]   Oh, cool story, cool story.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.680]   Yeah, stereo type.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.440]   You're a stereotype, Doc.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.440]   That's pun intended.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.440]   I like my music.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.680]   Listen, I'm driving down the street in Philadelphia.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.360]   And there's a school, I guess we're on a field trip.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.680]   And it's like a girl's school because it's all these girls.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.600]   They had to be like 10 years old.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:54.400]   I put on one direction, cranked me with all these kids to start dancing and the streets.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.160]   And the parents just look and be like, you're crazy.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.680]   Because I listen to everything but countries.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.960]   Sometimes I'm listening to like cake or Blink 182.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.560]   People just look at me like, that's some bumping crazy stuff.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:14.080]   Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.560]   Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift, bro.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560]   He's like fair.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.560]   He's like fair.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.040]   He's like, all right, Blink Space is a good song.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   I feel you fine.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040]   There you go.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.040]   There you go.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.040]   You're gonna juice for me.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.040]   Can you just do me a favor?
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.040]   Just play something good.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.440]   I'm about to drive out there to California so you can feel the rhythm.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.840]   I think there's certainly something said about feeling it.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.320]   No 4 inch subwoofer is gonna make you feel anything.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.360]   It sounds good for a speaker this size.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.360]   It sounds great.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.480]   And I think for most single room system, I'm not opposed to the sound of the thing.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.400]   If you looked in a small apartment or you would put it in the kitchen and then as you're
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.720]   cooking you'd have the music playing.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.720]   That's fine.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.600]   I just feel like right now it's very limited.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   And the lack of a line in and people say, well the Sonos doesn't have a line either.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   And that's true.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.600]   The ones anyway don't.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.960]   You have to get a 5 or you have to get a connect.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.920]   Yeah, I have play 5 all over the house.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   We have it all over the studio.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   We have play 5.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:12.120]   And you can also, fun fact, you can get like a Raspberry Pi and use a nap called Air Sonos
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.480]   to basically build your own play connect.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.640]   I've got to do that sometime.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   For about $50.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   I did it.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   It's great.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   Did you?
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.640]   And I did.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.640]   It was super easy.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.160]   And do you talk to it or?
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.840]   Well, at that point you just use the Sonos app.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.840]   You just saw that.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.920]   Because it doesn't have Alexa built into it.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.920]   So the Alexa and soon Google Assistant are only built into the one.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:39.240]   I mean I guess you could put an echo into it but that would mess up the line in and
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.240]   I want to connect it to the turntable is the main thing.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:49.160]   Now Apple is not making as much money on the HomePod as they are.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.480]   Most of their other products for instance.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.280]   Well it's according now these are always guests.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   This is tech insights.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.400]   38% profit margin is pretty good.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.400]   It's not bad.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.280]   Although for audio equipment that's pretty low because most audio equipment is usually
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.400]   sold so the profit margin is usually even higher.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.440]   But most places like if you go to a place.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.640]   The market's 100% in an audio store.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.720]   Yeah 50 to 60% market exactly.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.680]   So you've got to think that the margin is even higher.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:22.040]   So they say tech insights says it costs $216 to build a HomePod.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.760]   You know take it with a grain of salt.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:32.920]   They also say though that Google for instance gets a 56% margin on its Home and Amazon gets
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.360]   a 56% margin on their Echo.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.400]   So they're making a lot more money on those.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.600]   If they made a dollar on this speaker is good for advertisers because right now they
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600]   own beats.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600]   Beats cost $5.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   They sell them for $399.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   Exactly.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.600]   They're making their money.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.120]   And they don't sell their services which is their long term goal.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.600]   They want to get Apple Music.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   How do you mention their beats?
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   They're making it.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.240]   My understanding is when they did tear downs on the Beats headphones the most expensive
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.080]   part of them was the packaging.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.080]   And I saw this.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.080]   Did you see the iFixit's head down on the HomePod?
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.840]   Yeah they gave it a one out of ten for repairable.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.840]   They had to hack.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.480]   They actually took a hack.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.240]   They had to hack so all the end of it to get on the inside.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.880]   It's basically disposable product.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.840]   But in fairness I don't know any of these home speakers that are really going to be
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.400]   designed you know to be repairable in that sense.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.120]   And I think that's just part for the course.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.400]   If you buy a network speaker for the most part you're going to have to take it to a specialty
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.680]   repair place and they probably are going to just give you a warranty swap out.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.880]   I don't really know.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:37.080]   Actually Apple's repair cost for the HomePod is I think 80% of the sale price.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.920]   I mean that's clearly what they're doing.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.920]   They're swapping it out.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920]   Oh they're yeah exactly.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:46.600]   I mean that's why they're saying go ahead and buy the AppleCare plus or whatever.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.920]   It'll also cover your AirPort Express or Xtreme or whatever.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.920]   Or buy Google Max.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.920]   Is that what you have Owen?
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.400]   Yeah I'm googled out in the house right now.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.400]   How about you Christina?
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.080]   I haven't tried the Google Max.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.240]   My problem with the Google Assistant is that I have so many Google accounts.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.920]   I use like a different one for my you know main Google login that is not associated with
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.560]   my email or my calendar or anything else that I haven't at least last time I tried the Google
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.320]   Home it wasn't able to really work with my workflow.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.520]   I might try it again.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.160]   But no I'm pretty much all in on the Sonos.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.080]   But I do like the sound of the HomePod it's just for the money and for what it does right
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.080]   now.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.080]   There's no way I can justify it.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.600]   Now again like if in six months they are able to open it up and you can use it with
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.880]   more things then that changes the you know conversation a little bit but I still feel
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:43.880]   like for the price that it is and its limitations I personally can't justify it especially without
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.880]   the line in it.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.000]   And I know the Sonos doesn't have it either but it does have the ability to at least link
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.280]   with systems that do and my issue with the sound quality people are like oh the sound
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.680]   quality is so great and I'm like okay but you're playing for the vast majority of stuff
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:02.200]   you're playing you know lossy encoded music from an internet connection.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:06.560]   So why does this how does this fantastic sound quality why does it matter if you're
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.560]   literally pumping.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:15.280]   Actually airplay is not it's 44 one it is no I it is this is a little bit but it's
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:20.000]   still 256 kilobits right it's still you're still playing out of a petty little speaker
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.040]   I want right and you can technically do flak or alexa play right you can you can technically
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.480]   flak or alexa play but that takes a lot more effort and so most and most people aren't
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.000]   going to be playing that stuff so again even though yes it's CD quality what's the whole
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.800]   point of having this this high end audio system is to play you know something that's maybe
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.560]   better than that and instead you've got lossy a lossy encoded file running through it.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.520]   Are we unusual to kids today listen to stereo do they like I mean is that really oh and
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.280]   you're the real person here.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.960]   Yeah I know you have the daughter I don't know.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:59.000]   Kids listen to kids listen to their headphones yeah more more than anything else right now
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.320]   you'll see I live in those I see I mean anybody in our 20 they don't ever take them off.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:09.320]   Now and again this people having big stereo speakers in their home are dying off for sound
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:14.400]   bars and your warm TV and it's nobody wants to buy an amplifier anymore because you know
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:19.000]   you guys know that work so it times are changing things are changing but I just think that
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.880]   this Apple thing is a waste time.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.440]   Let me tell you a secret thing uncle is gone make it really sad about my Google home.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.320]   So I finally broke down I googled home down to house because I went to the battle between
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.520]   Alexa you went all in on the on the good so I went all good but you know what I did.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.800]   I got them all set up the weimos so they only turn on when I click on the weimos because
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.080]   I don't want nobody listening.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.580]   You don't want to be listening.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:43.040]   You don't want to be hearing those words of wisdom.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.680]   I got to go through an extra step to automate my house to turn the lights on and off but
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.280]   guess what in case I like kill a frog or something nobody is going to know about it.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:56.000]   I do really like the ability to speak to my lights and say turn off lights or turn on
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   lights.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.320]   Yeah definitely I have to say I thought that was dopey but I really like it.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:05.680]   I'm christine you might want to try the Google again because I have four different account
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.000]   set up and it's it can recognize up to five and it's been doing pretty good every once
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.480]   in a while it gets wonky and I have to reset it.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480]   But for the most part it does.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.480]   How do you distinguish between accounts though?
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.880]   So when you talk like this for one account and then the other account.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.120]   Talk like this and then it knows when you set up what the problem is when you set them
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:32.120]   up you can either I have set up to where my my office is set up to my my work on my bedroom
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.360]   and your camera just pull focus on you your camera is much more interested in the girls
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360]   behind you.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:44.040]   It's start it said who's this guy I want to see that woman in the Superman shirt yeah
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.440]   right and and thundercast on the other side.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:52.240]   Thundercast oh yeah so yeah I give it a try.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.240]   Okay I will see what I have a ridiculous set up I have a Google home max with an Amazon
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:02.440]   Echo show on top of it with this with the home pot on top of that.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.520]   You've got three thousand watts in your office at home.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.880]   I feel like the Ludd likes I have none of these in my home.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.520]   I don't want all that things you're right I don't I don't I just have to try them this
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.520]   is my job.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.800]   No no that's true that's true you could you could do what I just did like I said you turn
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:20.120]   them on and off I don't I'm not thinking they're listening to me Owen I think you're nuts I

[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.400]   set all this stuff up ran it through a firewall it's really quite disturbing how much stuff
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:33.640]   is being cut even if you're not in the house you know and the amount of unencrypted stuff
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:39.440]   being sent as well so it just I don't know I refuse to have them in the house I don't
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.200]   see the uncle Leo keep trusted I guess I got mine on we mo's I turn them on when I need
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:48.320]   them turn them off when I don't I want to read this I want to read this so-called article
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:56.120]   the house that's spied on me that's the one okay one bedroom smart home one and that sounds
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:03.120]   creepy how did so she's running wire shark on this or running pretty much every home automation
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.520]   device you can get plus running it through a custom gateway so you can see what's so it's
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:12.720]   sending packets all the time but that doesn't mean it's sending all the things she's saying
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.640]   just look at that amount of data coming out of your home yeah well she's using it as you're
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:20.600]   you saying is this time she never said a word to the Google home no I mean there are times
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.080]   when she didn't there was no one even in the house and it was sending a few packets but
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.880]   look I mean scroll down a bit further you'll see what I mean it's all right well I have
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:36.200]   to read this more closely because there's a lot of I think I the camera of course it's
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.720]   sending data the cameras recording no camera you'd expect to course that's sending data in
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:47.600]   particular it's the thing that for the world me most of the TV you know that's really highly
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:53.440]   our tea highly personal information and it's also picking up we actually do know that smart
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:59.440]   TVs exactly you know that they are saying data back about what you watch that's fine
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.400]   I don't care who cares what do you what do I care I don't think it's so much don't you
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.600]   think they know what I'm watching anyway I mean well I don't have a TV but I mean they
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.640]   should in theory but I don't know I'm not so concerned with with like some of the privacy
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.120]   things oh they're going to look at this but it's kind of an aggregate it's kind of I
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.160]   don't know problematic to think that on the one hand it would be nice to for your automated
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:27.080]   home to maybe adjust things when it knows your home and not home and and do things accordingly
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:32.040]   but on the other hand there is kind of a macro level a big brother kind of concern that
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.240]   I would have which is to say am I comfortable with all this information being handled by
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.600]   third parties and how competently are they going to protect that information that to me
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.280]   is the bigger thing and and that's why as much as I as I am freaked out by Google in
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:50.080]   a certain sense I sometimes am more comfortable with them just because at least they're confident
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.560]   I don't know but but but and sometimes I'm I'm more concerned with companies that are
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.920]   capturing all my information and I don't have any confidence in their competency and
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.360]   how they handle it or how they're going to resell it or how they're going to protect
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.640]   that information from others and that's when I look at TV manufacturers especially and
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:11.640]   I'm like I don't have any trust that they're not going to be selling this with highly personalized
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:15.600]   and attached from his articles a little bit of fun because she has a internet connected
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:21.240]   toothbrush an internet connected coffee machine I mean she got she basically she set up complete
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:28.000]   over the top a system where she's constantly online and nevertheless I didn't get the

[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.720]   yes because you have everything measured out and things like that so you can cook it's really
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.800]   great family do you do that with your daughter simpler do you ever cook with your daughter I had
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:51.160]   yes I do I do such a great thing to do I like to cook on my own but I have ordered a blurb before
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.240]   and it was just nice that I could just let her do a lot of things on her own yeah and we you know
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.840]   you're not going to mess it up because you have what you need there and you're just putting it in
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.600]   your reading instruction so she could follow along instead of me being like you just start
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.320]   that fast enough you didn't do that so it's something else besides my tutelage on telling her how to
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.480]   cook yeah so it's pretty good for that too oh and but you're giving her something so I mean I
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.160]   know it's nice to be able to know what to do when there's an active shooter but being able to cook
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:23.240]   actually something to do every day every or you should be you gotta eat so I haven't taught her like
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:28.920]   my three best dishes because I don't want her teaching what are you three best dishes I make
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:35.720]   great feta feta cheese and chicken alfredo oh yeah I make amazing baked macaroni and cheese oh yeah and
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:42.280]   I make Italian meatballs that I learned from a 96 year old Italian grandmother I will make you a
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:49.960]   deal if you will make the meatballs I will make the bolognese and I will make the pasta but you have
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:55.640]   to come to my place I will make fresh pasta and bolognese but you got to make the meatball because
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:00.520]   I have yet to I need a good meatball recipe I need to see how Owen JJ Stone does it
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:07.880]   IQMZ do you ever do cooking on your podcast network no I used to a long time ago and then I
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:15.240]   I got drunk and I didn't do it again so you mean during the show you got drunk yeah yeah
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:20.120]   I was like I was just cooking I also I also make this drink I call it the dirty doctor and it's got
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:24.520]   like eight shots of alcohol in this you know how to make that I was drinking it and it was just a
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:29.080]   whole problem and I had my friend has a really nice professional kitchen and I wasn't allowed back
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:35.800]   over there so that had to get away from it coming back to my you need to produce TV chef
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:41.320]   called Keith Floyd now the camera Keith Keith Keith Floyd he was renowned for he would never
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:45.880]   cook without alcohol so yeah okay so we throw the onions in Graham Kerr was like that the gal
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:51.640]   wine the one for the camera man yeah okay another slip that's not it happens quick yeah it's not a
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:57.080]   good way to cook actually we we kind of before the show we're talking a little bit about the end of
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:04.440]   Facebook and for instance Facebook lost about 2.8 million users in the US under 25 last year
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:11.720]   that's okay 2.8 million out of one and a half billion but those are the key users that's the
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:16.360]   future those under 20 hours in the coal mine and it's going to be very moved instagram I was going
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:20.920]   to say they leave instagram with a just leave Facebook because and did they leave messenger
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:25.880]   you see what I'm saying is Facebook happy though if you don't use the big blue product and you use
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:33.000]   instagram and they own it so you're not gone I don't think they just moved I feel like they can
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.360]   they can do more with Facebook than they can with instagram that's probably true but I feel like if
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.760]   they had to they would much rather at least still retain them on one platform then lose them wholesale
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:48.280]   messenger is a hot mess it's gotten worse and worse and worse the whole app thing is a hot mess
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:53.560]   if you install the Facebook app and the messenger app on your phone that's three quarters of a gig
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:59.720]   of storage taken up I think that's just ridiculous also messenger I was going to use it on android
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:05.080]   for my text messaging because it supports SMS on android and I got so confused yeah really well
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:11.800]   I did I'm not I said it up and I did unfortunately on valentine's day and I sent a very romantic
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:19.880]   lovely message to my wife and everybody I know because somehow got my story oh god it was very
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:25.640]   embarrassing roses are red valance are blue I messed up on Facebook I apologize
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:35.960]   so but it's I don't I'm not completely novice in this stuff I felt like it was way too easy
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:43.160]   to accidentally add it to my day and to everybody who knows me on Facebook which is
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:48.760]   hundreds of people saw it this is why you signal I mean it's got its faults but it's the you don't
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:55.560]   have the risk of that happening signal is and there's no advertising yeah it's secure I trust
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:00.680]   the security yep see is a damn good code or moxie marlin spike knows what he's doing oh yeah widely
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:08.120]   trusted by the community plus unlike other systems that are using open signal
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:14.760]   it's on by default encryption is always on if you're talking to a signal always on always end to
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:22.360]   end on their servers record very little so I want to use it but I'm kind of hooked on believe it
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:29.880]   or not I have to use Hangouts I'm a Google Fi customer I have many phones I want my messages to
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:35.640]   go to all the phones and I want desktop access see yeah that's why I'm an iMessage person
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:41.240]   if i message across platform I would but I agree with you one thousand percent I know I know I know
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:45.560]   no totally I mean like if I use an android device and that would be a problem and I will say when I
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:50.760]   use a Windows computer or a Linux machine it is a problem because you know my phone will show me
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.800]   the messages but I can't communicate from my desk to be on my desktop and I don't know I don't
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:00.520]   understand Google's well Google's messaging strategy is insane oh it is it's like how many
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:05.160]   if they're like six different services they all work differently they launch a new one every single
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:11.480]   you know IO it seems it's crazy it makes the bulls is like a you know care and some of the unit
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:16.360]   young people are turning against Facebook but they're going to continue with Instagram and
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:22.440]   messages yeah they do continue Instagram they're not they love it they say something that so this
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:28.520]   is let me tell you the mind of a 12 to 15 year old actually if you look at my Instagram right now
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:33.160]   you see all kinds of PC stuff because I have like all my friends have me following their kids because
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.520]   none of them know anything about the internet so like tell me my kids messing up are they pulled
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.760]   a boob out let me know what's going on so I have all these kids I'm following so you have to follow
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.240]   your friends kids that's so horrible yes yeah it is horrible because I can't post the grimy
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:50.520]   stuff I want to post I can't be dead that's why you need a bit of joke because there's like a
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.520]   12 year old girl in there that might understand what that joke means I can't do it but that's why
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.120]   you need your own Finsta Owen what's Finsta it's your it's your it's your fake Instagram that your
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:06.200]   parents don't know about where you post all the real stuff I need your Finsta I have I have 23
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:12.200]   Instagram accounts but anyway what um which one should I follow we've talked about this before I
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:18.680]   make money off of Instagram Instagram is great um anyway back to the point this the kids are using
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:23.880]   small like they small celebration in Philadelphia the other night yeah that was a Super all night
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:29.800]   that was uh the night they uh won the Super Bowl you actually your your Instagram food is quite good
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.160]   um well my my money making Instagram is really good because that's just all memes
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:39.320]   and and and promoting stuff because people want to pay you money when you have enough followers it's
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:43.960]   a great way for well do you want to share that and increase your followers no because if somebody
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:48.520]   ever knew it was me then I'd have a problem with some of the things last year so I shouldn't be
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:54.520]   doing so the autonomous uh part about that is even better any who's back to the point he's
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:00.360]   a later later Owen later off offline I want to know the story because I think that's something I
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:08.280]   could do yeah well I'm making a good chunk of change the kids are using snapchat filters and
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.840]   then they post want Instagram Instagram live like they have a system that they do they don't even
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:17.160]   hardly snapchat they they but they're now bringing it out at Instagram live is so prevalent they
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:22.040]   move it over there so they use snapchat for their filters save everything over and then post all
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:25.880]   that stuff on Instagram and they're balling out of control on Instagram right now because love
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:32.040]   Instagram especially now that snapchat redesigned stuff and made all the all the kids that oh let's
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:39.240]   talk about that what a whiny bunch of losers so snapchat is that chat that much worse it doesn't
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:45.080]   seem worse at all to me well I mean you gotta think okay you gotta think like how much have have we
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.400]   over the years complained anytime any service changes stuff it's it's just the new gerry
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:56.920]   norm but really snapchat is so walk me through this is it only on andra that it's changed or
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:02.360]   has it changed on iOS or no it changed on iOS too I mean and the differences so you go to the left
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.640]   and you've got all your friends you go to the right you got your new stories you discover you swipe
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:13.000]   up you've got your memories what but I don't it seems like it's changed where where stuff was put
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:19.400]   so if you're falling celebrities now you've got to deal with all of the the discover stuff and so
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:26.120]   I mean kids are kids are mad and snapchat obviously doesn't care but it's still interesting where are
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:32.200]   the stories now the stories are in that discover section oh I see so that's why they don't like it
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.360]   right because they don't want to be hounded by it so I have to see you all these kim kardashian
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:42.520]   bikini shots or whatever to find my DJ Khaled content right got it
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.880]   do you do you still you don't have the Mustang anymore right no so imagine you had the Mustang
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:53.000]   it's automatic and you just walk outside one day to get it and it's a stick are you gonna be annoyed
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.080]   yes okay then don't talk about kids and their snapchat right because things change but it's not
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:04.520]   like they put the accelerator pedal on the left you don't know nothing about snapchat you don't know
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:10.520]   how it feels you don't know how to differentiate acceleration and stick so Leo the kids are hurting
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:16.440]   oh they're hurting so you think this is a feature of I mean we so do you remember in the early days
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.360]   of Facebook when we saw they would change it slightly and everyone would kick up everyone with
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.480]   spots and well the difference is I think is that that Facebook had by that point already achieved
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:31.480]   such a mass of use of you know such such mind share that even though people would always say oh
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.400]   I'm gonna delete my account like I remember I one time this was years and years ago I wrote a
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.480]   a story for a mashable that says like no you're not going to delete your Facebook account
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:44.200]   and because there's this delete Facebook day and and all these people told me how wrong I was and
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.280]   then you know the next you know news report time it was like Facebook had added even more users
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:52.680]   than ever before how many times have I deleted Facebook I mean you know but but but but people
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:57.160]   aren't going to do it I think the difference here is that you know snap the reason they did this big
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:01.560]   redesign is because they're trying to improve engagement because engagement hasn't continued
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.960]   to rise the way they want it to and they're also trying to increase advertising and they're trying
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:12.440]   to get you know a different demographic interested and the problem is is that they have a competitor
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:19.160]   which Facebook never had right copying them you know part and parcel and isn't messing things up
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:23.800]   so there is a real risk I think that you think Instagram is gonna do a snapchat with Facebook
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:30.760]   did the MySpace yes wow yeah it's already happened I've already told you people go to snapchat to post
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:35.800]   Instagram like they're literally going there to get what you need to post it where you want
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.200]   a pro tip on snapchat fraud or snapchat I know there's not that many of you but when somebody sends
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:44.680]   you a proud message you don't want them to know you just slide your finger to the sidewalk
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.360]   peak almost 80% through snap that mid-back they don't even know you opened it yeah I mean
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:53.880]   this so you know you got that sneaking and you don't know what percentage triggers the I saw you
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:30:00.600]   look at that you got like a 75 80% line you almost the whole way huh yeah for putting airplane
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:04.440]   mode right right before you swipe it over because then it's loaded in the cash and then they don't know
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:10.840]   true yep that's worked I gotta click so right now snapchat what would you so the thing you would
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:18.600]   use snapchat for is the the face mask the location stuff that they don't care because they you're
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:24.040]   still they're still getting the oil of Olay ad and there and all that right yeah but I mean from
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:28.120]   a perspective it's a it's a lot better if you don't like I mean because if you look at your
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:32.760]   standard Facebook page now if you go into your profile and actually analyze how much of that
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:38.600]   is advertising stories whatever else bullshit they want to put in there and actually look what
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:44.600]   is coming from people you care about and who you are in contact with it's a tiny proportion yeah
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:51.240]   that's why she will use Instagram yeah can you see my screen yeah yeah so this is a
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:58.760]   sample of a kid one of my friend's kids and every self self is a snapchat that she's posting an
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:05.480]   Instagram yep so okay so how do I do that I just recorded a video do I press the send button
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:11.000]   oh shoot I just sent that to everybody see you just save it to your you save it to your camera
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:17.160]   roll and then you pull it from your camera roll and post it to Instagram I'm gonna create a snapchat
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:26.120]   account for the oldster oh crap I sent it out how do you do this what are you doing now but I will
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:31.160]   say you just be you could just be the bubbler hey I live in San Francisco and I think this is how
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:35.080]   the internet is supposed to work yeah the bubbler we talk to each other I'm living in the bubble
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:39.480]   what we're doing but the real world I hear doing stuff I assume if you were yelling at me last show
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.320]   about the Amazon firestick the fact that you didn't know what's going on in these streets oh people
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:50.040]   thought I was an idiot but you're like how can you call yourself the tech guy if you don't know how
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:56.360]   people are pirating using Cody and fire sticks like it's so good you're not a criminal I mean I
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:00.920]   pay for cable I do pay for cable I pay yeah I pay for cable so I didn't know that I pay for
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:06.680]   everything but I also know how that stuff works because sometimes there are other other things you
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:11.560]   want to watch and you can't find them other ways I'm not ashamed to say that occasionally I am
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:16.200]   ignorant on the ways of the pirates oh like I said you're not a criminal like some people
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:23.800]   like that guy and he's not too smart who's selling the fire sticks at the girl softball and he's not
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:31.560]   the smartest guy when I when I see him I'm gonna show him that episode just stick it on so 1.2 million
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:36.760]   people have signed the remove the new snapchat up and it won't work it'll just be like with Facebook
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:42.280]   we're only working the only way it'll work because the petitions are useless is if next quarter they
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:46.280]   were able to say there was less engagement if they were able to actually see what they care about
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:51.080]   that that's what they care about and do they if I do what I just did which is make a snapchat video
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.720]   and then post on Instagram that still counts for them um I don't know I don't I don't know what
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:59.720]   what signals they're looking at because they might be how many stories are you watching how
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:03.240]   many messages are you sending how often are you watching it they need people to watch the stories
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.840]   don't they yeah that's what they really need is they need people to watch the stories watch the
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:12.440]   ads and if they start that going down then I think they would reverse course and change again but
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:16.280]   until that happens you know you could have 10 million people sign a petition no one cares
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:21.000]   but I will say I agree with Owen I mean because I'm not a teen but I love the teens
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.280]   and you know they're all about Instagram using the snapchat filters and and Instagram has copied
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:31.480]   all the good parts of snapchat so even if Facebook is hemorrhaging people under 25
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:37.160]   hemorrhaging 2.8 million big deal wow that's no cause for concern mark says that's fine we got
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:43.480]   you with instagram two things one no russian hackers on instagram that's true are there's no
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:49.400]   comments section with uh bebop and rocksteady either so right when you have instagram comments
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:55.080]   somebody might say you're ugly you're fat you're whatever you don't get a bible verse about guns
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:34:02.200]   or dinosaurs or dogs or russia you can block people you can turn them off yep easy peasy lemon
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:10.120]   squeezy and I have to say the ads on instagram get me every time yeah me too i bought stupid
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:17.880]   like phone cases and and so much stupid stuff yeah i bought i bought like bras because of instagram
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:26.520]   absolutely me too they're they're making so much money off of i'm nobody but let me put up an
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:34.200]   instagram ad people it drives me insane some dude in st louis with with three followers has got
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:40.040]   instagram ad i'm like what are you doing bro yeah nobody's like but they get regular i see
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:45.320]   so many more regular people paying for instagram ads right now it's it's really freaking me out
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:52.360]   so they're getting money it works and and messenger you think it has a coherent it feels like messengers
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:58.600]   kind of a mess mess people use what's that what's that oh that's the facebook property too isn't it
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.560]   yeah it is it's better than messenger though but yeah i mean people use messenger i think
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:08.120]   in large because they have to because if you yeah messengers the one message is that everybody
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.440]   has yet you could say signal but i can't convince anybody to use it well no but you see if i get a
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:17.560]   message from facebook and i i don't have the facebook app on my account i just go into it by its web page
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:21.320]   i can't read down the web page because facebook is intentionally they've separated that so that
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:27.720]   you've got to have messenger on there and it grinds my gears something wrong i agree with you because
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:32.680]   it's two two apps and but that said it's it's interesting i there are a few people that i have
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:36.840]   conversations with exclusively a messenger the rest of them you know it's either i message or
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:41.960]   signal or whatever i don't really use what's happened i know that's really popular um but yeah i mean
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.680]   but between what's happened and messenger i mean they kind of own the majority of the messaging space
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:52.600]   too so it doesn't matter so much if if the teens are leaving facebook proper i'm sure they're not
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.920]   happy about that but is it would be more problematic if they were leaving snapchat or not snapshot if
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:02.120]   they were leaving instagram but since they're not leaving instagram you know they can still advertise
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:06.440]   and they can still get that information and then i think the the long-term goal whether this works
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:13.560]   or not would be to then somehow say okay well now you have a reason to use facebook proper once you
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:19.960]   age out of something so oh in your experience with the youngsters the yutes is that they are
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:25.080]   completely happy with instagram they'll still use snap to make their stuff but they're they
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:29.400]   instagram is a platform they like yeah but they just don't want to be on facebook because facebook
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:35.640]   is argumentative mom and well it's also where mom and dad are on yeah facebook has been told
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:42.520]   to stop stalking belgens sometimes have i heard that uh or face finds of 250 000 euros a day
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:47.000]   yeah the EU takes privacy really really seriously and it's about time of our
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.320]   companies realize this because gdpr is rolling down and there are going to be some big big finds
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:58.360]   so the brussels court said that facebook doesn't provide users with enough information on what
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:06.040]   data it gathers or how long that data is retained they focused on cookies social plugins the share
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:11.720]   button is and like button is a big one invisible pixels and how facebook uses them to collect
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:18.440]   information on people's browsing behavior the german court last week ruled that facebook
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.240]   hadn't done enough to alert people to the pre-ticked privacy settings and its mobile app the defaults
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:31.160]   uh so facebook's starting to get some pushback you think this is gdpr oh this is this is privacy
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:36.040]   protection i'm all i've been you know talking my father myself blew with american companies about
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:41.320]   this because they just don't get it facebook did add a feature where you can delete your account
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:46.280]   thoroughly and completely yep because they had to probably be a gdpr i'm sure that was what it was
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:51.880]   right yeah but a lot of american companies and a hell of a lot of Asian companies just don't get it
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:57.560]   if you've got an EU customer you need to go along with this and the finds are going to be massive
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:02.760]   so get it sorted out we're running out of time on this and facebook says you know we've got we've
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:07.720]   got this sorted it'll be fine i'm unconvinced but i would love to hear whatever else has to say on
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:11.800]   that this is this isn't that big a deal it's not like facebook's the kind of company that would
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:19.480]   direct you to a vpn and have you set it up oh never i think the ferris the film look at this this is
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:26.680]   the uh this is company you can protect yourself with a vpn oh novel protect for android for
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:34.120]   iphone it's save measure protect your mobile data does it say anywhere who owns this company does it
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:42.200]   mention that it's owned by facebook facebook why are you asking questions uncle leo don't you
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:47.160]   face book and everybody looking at just after why are you going to ask these questions i'll be
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:51.640]   honest i don't trust facebook if facebook made a virtual assistant that i put in my house i would
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:56.600]   not use that no it's coming their speaker's coming is are they going to do a speaker yeah it's good i
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:01.320]   can't wait to get it it's room it's becoming later on but really how interesting i mean it's the
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:06.520]   really wow this is the payoff you always have with a vpn is that they have your browsing history
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:11.160]   now it's who do you trust your vpn not facebook yeah do you go to someone like facebook which will
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:16.920]   monetize the hell out of it yeah or do you go to a small vpn who you trust and you as a decent record
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:23.720]   you know it's not hard it's not a hard sell or or you spin up a vps and install open vpn and run
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:27.960]   your own yeah well this christian is where you were talking about earlier with people in bank
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:32.200]   accounts of bitcoin and not knowing so this is where people don't have the knowledge of something
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.760]   and facebook just saying here you go this is a way i feel bad for the consumer like whoa bro
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.920]   you don't understand what's going on like the currency thing i was like whatever you mess
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:46.120]   into the currency on your own but this this is a violation this is trickery this is scurry
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:52.040]   how about facebook do you they they so if you use facebook to factor which you should
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:40:01.480]   uh they will uh send you a text message from fb ook 36265 but then they have your phone number
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:08.280]   and apparently they've been accidentally they say sending sending other info again yeah no cake
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:12.680]   conger at gizmodo wrote this great thing about how she set up this secondary facebook account and
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:17.160]   to communicate with sources because she didn't want to do it from her main account which fair and
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.560]   she uh she didn't log into it very often but she had two factors set up and then facebook is sending
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:27.240]   her text messages all the time please log in please do this please do that and then it was only after
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:32.200]   she wrote about it that they were that facebook's like oh our bad we didn't do that we're sorry
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:38.840]   it's like no Alex steve's chief security officer said oh that was a bug that was a mistake sure it
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:43.960]   was because the funny thing is if you responded to the fb ookay it posted on your timeline
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:49.560]   you know what you know see this is where i don't trust anything i just found out last week when i
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:55.640]   made another gmail account that i can only have so many phone numbers for them to verify i have a
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:41:00.760]   burner phone that every single tech that's all this phone does it's a backup phone my phone breaks
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.160]   i take the sim out but everything gets texted that my two all goes to that phone that phone only and
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:11.400]   you can't imagine the spam text i get i've got stuff from strip clubs to mom and pops ops and i don't
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:16.040]   know who's sending them but you can't trust nobody with your phone number uncleio well that's random
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:20.040]   they're just doing random phones numbers i don't know if they're necessarily
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:24.120]   knowing there's somebody i don't know that it's not uncleio i don't know that it's not yeah i mean
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:27.560]   last month i was down at the enigma conference and they got a guy from google there and he was
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:33.240]   saying less than 10 percent of gmail users have two factors turned on yes that's sad if we're talking
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:37.400]   and that's just a simple two factor instead of people where they get an sms message
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:41.880]   well about 20 percent have a problem you don't have to be easy to turn on i mean i think that if you
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:46.200]   if google cared about turning on two factor and this goes for all the companies if they cared
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:49.880]   about turning on two factor they would they would prompt you to do it frequently they would make
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.840]   it easier to do and and that would be part of the process instead what they do every so often when
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:00.360]   you log in from a different you know location or different ip it'll say hey is this is this backup
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.400]   email and backup phone number for you correct but it doesn't say hey while you're here why don't
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:10.840]   you turn on two factor so i think part of it is is obviously i think a huge part of it the reason
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:15.000]   less than 10 percent is because google doesn't prioritize people turning it on they that that's
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.240]   not something that they've wanted to design for if they wanted people to use two factor
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:23.400]   they could very easily you know change up and send those for apples and goes for facebook same
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:29.560]   goes for any of these companies they could you know make it part of the the login process to
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:33.960]   highly encourage people to use two factor but they don't oh sure but i mean we're talking we
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:37.480]   were talking about sort of facebook vp ends if we're expecting if we're saying that people have
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.560]   trouble with gmail's two factor think how much trouble they're going to have setting up their own
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:46.360]   vpn and exactly which turn around and say oh this is right i'm just saying that i don't look behind
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:50.360]   curtain about what we're doing that's just well precisely and be and if you look at the language
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:56.120]   that they use around that vpn they're not promising you privacy so much as they are saying oh you know
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:00.200]   this is a secure way to do something but they're not claiming we won't capture everything that you're
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:05.560]   doing and then sell ads on it you know it's uh but but people hear vpn and they think oh well that's
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:11.160]   a safe way to do something they're not actually considering um the motives that facebook might have
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:18.520]   that's wrong i agree yeah hmm it's kind of a depressing wake
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:26.840]   jeez mobile world congress is coming up anything happy there anybody going to uh bartha lona
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:33.880]   oh my goodness no you have the same now i see it used to be oh i won't go to ces but i can't wait
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.040]   to go to barcelon you don't even want to do that no you see i used to go to it back when it was uh
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:45.960]   but when it was known as uh uh three gsm uh it was held in can rather than in nice lona now and that
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.920]   fell apart because the can mobile network couldn't handle the fact you know 30 000 people with four
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.400]   mobiles a piece came in and you know something dropped calls don't get me wrong boss lonars a
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:59.720]   lovely city the pickpockets are insane but it is a lovely city yes they are but it is very pretty
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:05.880]   mobile world congress is just too big and it's become like ces yeah it's a show for salespeople
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:10.040]   it's not a show for for finding a man i'm not gonna say anything about it forget i even mentioned
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:15.000]   well i mean the samson will be showing off the the s9 right yeah that's the plan the camera
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.080]   reimagine we will actually stream life coverage of this next sunday i want to see what noki is doing
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:26.920]   out there what is it eight a.m nine a.m really early in the morning yeah no no no no no no no
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:31.080]   the sales figures that came on i was actually really shot by it they're out selling they're
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:36.440]   out selling like all these other guys yeah i was very impressed at that surprise and that's what
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:41.960]   they're android is smartphones right they're not not the 33 10 not the candy bar phone that
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:46.120]   is it that's a toy but i mean i've just cracked the screen on my current phone and i was looking
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:51.880]   through the old terms of you know that noki are two looks pretty good you know lousy processor but
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:57.640]   great battery life and that's what i look for so you know i mean i'm curious as an event a week
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:05.640]   after samson's event february 25th and it will be oh no that's the same that's also the samson
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:10.920]   day same day that's both next sunday well we'll have to cover both we expect to see the nokia
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:17.480]   nine as well as the galaxy s9 it's nice how they've all kind of coalesced on nine i'm
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:24.040]   curious to see how well the snapdragon new pro snoot new dragon 45 yeah actually works in practice
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:28.440]   because it's been built up and built up right and usually when that happens it comes in for a
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.080]   hard fall when it comes to and ironically qualcom's already talking about the next generation
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:37.320]   which is always good to get a bit of them yeah but you see they're beating everyone else in the
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:42.200]   market like a reddit a stepchild so i mean it's just a question about getting in there and taking
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:50.680]   people's mindset and non did publish uh their performance review of the 845 setting the stage
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:56.120]   for the flagship android phone of this year all of them will use the 845 except of course apple
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:02.440]   right it's interesting though if you compare the numbers how close uh qualcom has now come to
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:08.920]   what everybody was raving about the apple hmm uh few what is a 11 fusion processor and now
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:14.200]   i think a little catch-up time now for uh qualcom well they've also got the really
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:20.120]   so co-qualcom and sam's sing have got the the really ultra low level architecture now the
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:25.960]   intel can't get right and you know it's right it's it's looking like it's going to be where
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.360]   with a real crux point here because once you get down into 10 and 7 nanometer architectures
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:35.720]   the amount of problems you've got in just building the chips in an economical way
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.960]   and intel hasn't cracked this yet no sam's singing qualcom seem to have got there but
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:45.240]   is it is the 845 10 nanometer or it's the next one is 10 i think it's 10 this one's 10 and then
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:52.120]   they're going down to seven they're going to seven um holy cow amazing look at the 3d mark slingshot
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:47:00.680]   measures the qualcom 845 uh outpacing everybody by a good margin including the iPhone 10 the
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:06.360]   google pixel 2 XL which are neck and neck this s8 and then the rest going down that's a future
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:12.120]   mark uh benchmark um so what cast your question what what do what what do people think people are
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:17.640]   doing with their phones i know i know they're not bitcoin mining or or i think that the next step
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.160]   right is that it'll be it won't just be our phones right like i think that's going to be the next
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:25.560]   step obviously you see the windows on arm stuff and and there's all the rumors about you know potentially
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:31.320]   you know macos at some point running you know on arm and and i think that that's that's kind of
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:36.920]   the next step is that well that that's because that's because apple's like their pro version is
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:41.480]   now pro consumer and they're making mouse and all their equipment that that's actually a problem i
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.040]   don't want that i mean i i want to approach them to stay pro but i get what you're saying and if
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.440]   it's going that way that's gonna make me mad well well but i mean i think in theory i mean you're
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:53.880]   looking at if you're trying to build something like it like a like a macbook right or if you're
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:59.160]   trying to build like a low-level laptop at this point the intel stuff as as as Ian's pointing out
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:03.560]   really hasn't they haven't been able to kind of catch up in the same way that qua-com is and so
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:09.320]   if you could have the advantage of having great battery life um the support for a modem so you
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.480]   can actually have always on connectivity and now your processors because they're there's so much
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:18.680]   you know smaller the nanometer level are even more power efficient and and um better performance
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:24.280]   like why would you be why would you not consider um if you if you could get the software to run the
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:28.200]   right way and and and not have huge performance hence why would you not consider making that your
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:34.040]   platform for a laptop i just worry we're going to get back to the old wind tell situation whereby
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:40.040]   everyone ever faster process get released and the operating system manufacturers respond by
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:45.800]   bloating and bloating their os out yeah that's more to justify the need for these new processors
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.720]   yeah for most of most of us unless you're watching video or playing a really high-end game on your
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:56.280]   mobile phone you don't need the ultra-spiffy spark browser if you're just browsing and reading
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:01.880]   ebooks on your phone just get a lower grade processor and save yourself a fortune well especially since
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:07.800]   most of the apps have not been written to um take advantage of that's gonna well you know this
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:11.560]   windows on arm is going to be an interesting test of that because it's acknowledged it's a
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:16.920]   obviously slower but with their call it all day battery life if that's what people want they'll
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:21.400]   buy it my guess is that's not what they they maybe they do want that but what they they don't
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:27.400]   nobody's going to buy a slower we've been down this way with windows on arm before and i wish
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:32.520]   them all the luck in the world but if if they actually do it then i'm not going to say eat my
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:39.000]   hacks i quite like my hats severely severely surprised i mean i i will say and obviously this
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:44.120]   is some you know bias of where i work coming in i do think the approach from from what's been
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:47.720]   publicly released and and that's all i know i'd obviously i don't know anything else but
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:51.880]   from what's been publicly released that the approach this time is is at least different and
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:59.800]   i think that's important this isn't i would love to get hard numbers on every time apple comes out
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:04.520]   with someone from the unreal to play a game on their phone and they tell you how much faster your
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:10.520]   phone's gonna run when every time i see somebody playing a phone is splashy or two dots right
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:17.320]   calamazoo crossword puzzle nobody's on their phone i hear trying to go into the matrix but they come
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:21.080]   out here every year and tell you that you're gonna be able to do something you could never do before
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:26.120]   what the monster what nobody's doing i mean i think nobody's spending $9.99 on that stuff i give
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:29.720]   at your point is extremely valid but in the commonsense word i'm like man how much
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:36.520]   value the one nanojigabyte phone the one place the camera we had a really good piece yesterday
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:43.880]   by dp review on the computational photography the iphone 10 and the pixel 2xl and they are doing
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:49.000]   amazing stuff because of the processing power that's very true i mean these aren't great sensors
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.880]   these aren't great lenses but they are getting basically dp reviews conclusion was
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:51:00.600]   practically micro four thirds quality images in the pixel 2xl with a sensor that's one ninth
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:06.760]   the size yeah and the pixel 2 does great stabilization that's done by the processor so yeah that
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:10.760]   that's where you can shut me up we talk about photography and video i'm on board with that
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:16.600]   less processor and up everything else processor it up baby says oh and jj stone let's take a break
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:22.520]   i'm getting a bunch of snapchat messages i want to read but the kids today you know how they are
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:26.680]   but i showed it a well before we do that i want to play a little video a little movie
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:31.720]   uh we made we got the people the guys in the back room they've been working it's fun it's cute
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:37.720]   watch previously on twit look i found a pistachio nut in my pocket would you like one
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:42.600]   um i normally don't eat things out of your pocket that's something i've learned it's also
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:51.240]   oh this is so i know i don't forget my name oh yeah that's nice security now there are now
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:52:01.880]   experiments being conducted with drones being used to move a essentially a spy outpost into an

[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:10.840]   what was your favorite super ball commercial i know you were busy watching the game but
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:17.400]   i thought this year's super well commercials were trash you know what i love absolute trash
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:23.080]   i'll tell me tied because i'll come put a stain right on your shirt i love tied i thought that was
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:29.160]   brilliant because every time a commercial came on you said is this a tied commercial and it basically
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:34.360]   they owned your mind share the whole darn game well not you but everybody else you're busy going
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:39.320]   i love you nick falls i love you they didn't own anybody's mind share do you know why because
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:45.640]   nobody woke up the next day and said tie with what's up like oh where is the beat oh people
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:49.960]   go go around the world with a great commercial and repeat over and over again nobody in the history
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:54.360]   oh wait a minute woke up the next morning and said you know what the kids you know what the kids
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:02.280]   call beer in boulder colorado dilly dilly oh my god dilly dilly they say i'll take it dilly dilly
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:07.960]   i disagree these now i agree sometimes viral doesn't do any good to you but i think
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:13.320]   for well like first of all nobody changes there's there's the detergent preference ever i'm talking
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:18.120]   about this specific one you choose what detergent you're gonna buy when you wash your first
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:22.920]   little clothes in college right you remember this you're dead on and that's why i'm just tied
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:27.080]   and you'll never you don't need it you don't even need to think about it it's just i by tied
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.320]   do you know how's time could have everybody in the nation it's either regular but yeah yeah
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:35.320]   tie could have everybody in the nation talking about tie the next day if they would have ran
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:40.680]   that many commercials that said tie-pods don't eat it you pops about it uh Doritos both don't eat
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:44.760]   it that actually would have been funny that i kind of wish they'd done that but me it's
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:47.560]   that would have been a great commercial i was brought up by don't eat it everybody in the
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:54.440]   morning would have woke up talk about don't eat it don't eat it anyway turn turn on the turn on
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:00.360]   Ian's mic the schmukon skilts conference last uh last month they had some guys wandering around
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:07.000]   with tight pod bags filled with beef jerky just like chewing away just like i think twix or somebody
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:14.040]   one of the candy things are making twix candy no no no yeah what's wrong with children what's wrong
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:20.040]   they're not children children actually do eat tie-pods and detergent and don't and all kind of
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:27.800]   stuff by accident these are 17 to 28 year old usually called casians doing a tie-pods wrong
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:34.040]   with Caucasians these days i couldn't find one person doing it i looked i searched i looked uh
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:37.880]   but it is just the people just daring each other to do something and then they really
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:42.040]   wider thrown up and find them somehow and then most of the time they're not even really eating
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:46.440]   them they're just like biting into it and then like mine you know it tastes so bad it's like okay
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:52.600]   you know it's it's yeah are you saying black folk are too smart to do that i want to know what
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:59.160]   you're saying i'm not even too smart i'm saying if a black kid bit into a tie-pod his mom would be
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:03.880]   them she said i would mean to wash your mouth out with soap for a long time kid
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:08.840]   89 and you over here bite you ain't getting on clean clothes or weed that's the thing
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:15.080]   and you don't clean clothes dude everybody else you know
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:21.560]   billi ain't all the type of money and i guess we got a target stop eating the tie-pods chat yeah
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:27.000]   and there's culture is a little bit different thanks that's all i'm saying especially with the
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:34.120]   butt whoopens uh here's a here's a guy's not getting a butt whoopin ryan murphy this is this blows my
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:40.680]   mind so i know you're not a steff curry fan we know that about you own jj stobot wardel curry
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:46.200]   i'm sorry mama named ordell's ordell's i didn't mean to start this whole thing again but wardel
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:49.880]   what was his deal with the mba i think 200 million for for five years
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:55.880]   but this guy's an amazing ballplayer ryan murphy just did a deal with netflix
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:59:02.440]   300 million dollars for five years yep he's making more than steff wardel curry
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:07.880]   well if he brings in more to fox or he has brought him more to fox over his he uh he did
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:15.080]   do we then he did nip tuck he did american christmas uh he did uh american horse story and um now the
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:20.200]   american crime story oj uh you know people present oj that was a good one which is fantastic now the
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:26.120]   assassination of johnnie fursachi i mean let's be honest he has been the main prestige person behind
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:32.040]   fx as as a network he says the history of this moment is not lost on me i'm a gay kid from indiana
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:39.480]   who moved to hollywood in 1989 with 55 dollars in savings in my pocket so my dreams have crystallized
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:46.200]   and come true but that shows you this guy's a showrunner so that's how much he's worth the netflix
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:52.760]   50 million 60 million a year for five years he brings in the books he does get in two things one
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:57.560]   uh athletes have a cap so wardel could have got more than 200 million but there's a whole
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:02.840]   cap to keep him down secondly netflix could you please stop paying people this money
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:09.720]   just stop it okay go to the dude and say hey what'd you take 40 million a year and how about this
[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:15.960]   this is over to five years ago it's a salary cap for streaming media on netflix they're paying
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:22.280]   they're the money that they pay is unsustainable how does chris rock uh darshan pal this one just
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:28.200]   got two 50 million how much did rock get for tambourine do you know 50 million 50 million for that one
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:34.120]   yeah i'm like it's only an hour bro it's uh you can't sustain no wonder he was smiling
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:41.560]   ron ron ron ron ron's head that china ron ron's got i think 200 million or 250 million when she um
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:47.720]   left abc um for for netflix but but i mean to tian's point i mean you know he has brought in more
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:54.760]   than 60 million a year for per fox um i don't know if i have to say it's no no commercials
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:01:00.680]   that's my money that's my money spending my money the difference with foxes foxes
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:06.600]   foxes what's up top but you're happy you're happy that that so um i'm not going to be happy
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:12.440]   when netflix is 42 dollars a month okay bro i'm not i don't care how many times they tell me they're
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:16.920]   going back in the past and re-referring the future i don't think anybody thinks this is gonna last
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:21.000]   forever because obviously it won't but since we are in this golden age of content i'm not gonna be
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.480]   i'm not gonna hate on ryan murphy or chana ron's or or any of these creators getting these huge
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:29.640]   paydays it is interesting though how this happened because ryan murphy i think most of us thought that
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.840]   he would have been at fox forever he's worried about the disney thing well that's exactly it and
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:40.360]   apparently disney was in advance negotiations with him um to to you know ensure things would happen
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:44.920]   and i think he he was concerned and probably rightfully so that he hit the the subject matter
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:51.080]   of his content might not be a good fit for for the disney brand um and so netflix used that as
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:56.680]   an opportunity to kind of say okay we we got you um and he did 911 i didn't know that that's the
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:01.400]   new one is that any good it looks good the promos look good yeah i mean i mean i mean i mean i
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:05.320]   no no reena and i won one that's great but no no i've seen it with kani britain um it's good and i
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:10.200]   i like the the first tachi show that's on i mean i thought that the people versus uh oj simpson was
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:18.920]   the best it aired in 2016 um and and it gave us um um uh uh you're too young though
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:25.000]   you're you don't remember do you remember the oj trial at all i do i i was like i was like 11
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.920]   but i was obsessed um because the support of the air you can thank that trial for the kardashians
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:36.440]   oh i know i know i know um it was actually funny i remember when the sex tape happened i was like
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:41.560]   is that robert kardashians kid like that's that was my first thought because i was obsessed um at
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:48.520]   11 with the oj trial um and uh no but i mean i i've been a rinder if you pan since he had a show on the
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:53.640]   wb network called popular which no one but me watched um and then he obviously niptuck was his
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:59.000]   first big success but he's gone on with american horsey he says in the new york times article he was
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:05.000]   so worried about the acquisition by disney he went to robert eiger the chief executive there and said
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:10.120]   am i gonna have to put micky mouse in american horror story that is of course every content
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:14.760]   creator's nightmare right it's kind of if it was done right i kind of watched that i would watch
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:21.480]   if there was a bacon slicer whole poker and the parafliers involved maybe you know i'm not a
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:26.840]   i'm not against anybody getting their money like rhymes and this dude even getting a deal for five
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:31.000]   years i get that it's a sustained period of time because they're doing multiple shows multiple hours
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.320]   it's just like when i see again i love chris rock i watched the show three clack and more
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:41.080]   so it came out but i'm like it was 55 minutes of somewhat laughter and then it was over and i
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:46.280]   had no more of it and i had 50 million dollars i'm like whoa bro y'all just out here toss it out
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:51.560]   change like it's kind of amazing yeah i know i mean it's amazing about my life it is amazing
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:55.720]   amount oh it's it's crazy but it's it's i mean that's right now anyway and again this is not
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:00.280]   gonna last forever but as they do is they go after you know expanding and getting more and
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:05.480]   more subscribers and they have been gaining subscribers that's the key that's the key and i
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:10.680]   think that some onus when you get new subscribers you can't lose them so you can't it is a they are
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:15.960]   now on a treadmill they have to continue to produce content that keeps those new subscribers and
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:20.680]   generates more and that's gonna be very challenging i think it is i mean that the thing with i mean
[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:24.920]   if you know this from hbo has has known this for for years and obviously you know they are one of
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:31.000]   the most profitable if not the most profitable part of of time Warner is that it's cyclical in
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.840]   terms of when people would subscribe and then drop the service and that was one of the reasons
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:39.640]   why they they launched hbo go and hbo now as they basically said you know you can have all of our
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:44.200]   catalog content on demand as well but people used to you know like in the sopranos heyday and
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:48.280]   sex in the city heyday you know they'd subscribe during those months when the show's run and then
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:54.120]   unsubscribe and and you start to see you know people um you have to have this especially
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:58.600]   streaming when you have people when you release all the content once you have to have a constant
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:03.560]   influx of content otherwise will will binge it and then cancel and so you don't want to have
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:08.360]   and people do do that there are cyclical things and people do you know cancel and resubscribe
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:14.280]   but Netflix wants to be able to kind of convince people you should continue to pay your 12 or 15
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:21.080]   dollars a month if you're using the 4k plan you know three thousand dollars a second how much is
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:27.160]   50 million dollars for an hour that's a million dollars it's uh it's almost like a million a minute
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:31.400]   it's not a hundred thousand yeah it's about it's less than a million a minute
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:38.360]   yeah like nine hundred thousand i think yeah so i just said that that's good money
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:45.400]   hey google how much is 50 million dollars per second that's probably not a well-formed question
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:49.320]   how many seconds Leo what are you talking about 50 million divided by 60 is what you want
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:55.000]   phone down what are you doing just stop it we're good next door actually no you want no i know what
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:00.520]   you want it's 50 million divided by 60 i don't know how much is 50 million dollars divided by
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:08.360]   360 it's i was gonna say per per minute it's 833 000 and then divide that again by 60 to get seconds
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:13.880]   god that's a lot of money that's like what may weather makes 300 million dollars for 12 three
[02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:19.160]   minute round yeah but he's getting a crap beaten out of him he doesn't get touched okay that's true
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:23.720]   somebody's getting the crap beaten out of him yeah somebody else it's not him according to google
[02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:33.000]   it's .0138 meters yeah okay i think i didn't run in wrong that's all right we began with a sad we
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:40.120]   began with a sad story so i'm going to lift you up with a happy story the fcc watchdog is investigating
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:49.640]   chairman agit pi because he released he relaxed media ownership rules right before
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:56.680]   conservative broadcaster sing claire announced a 3.9 billion dollar deal to buy
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:07:03.080]   tribune media without those rules there is no deal and they pulled it together remarkably quickly
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:11.720]   there lots of synchronization between the chairman of the fcc and sing claire broadcasting the fcc
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:20.520]   inspector yep fcc inspector general uh has launched an inquiry we shall see of course remember that
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:28.360]   agit pi was uh for years uh spokesman for thrine industry horizon i mean i'm i'm hoping this
[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:37.320]   may lead us to say bye bye agit pi but yeah but i i did like to write that headline which
[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:43.400]   i are you kidding i i i mean someone else certainly no so it's killing myself but no i mean this
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:49.480]   looks dodgy is all hells this rule thing goes i mean to organize a 3.9 billion dollar merger
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:55.560]   generally takes at least six months just it must have at least had lunch to discuss you know and
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:08:01.400]   it's just just within a couple of weeks of this coming out so oh right okay we've got
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:06.680]   the just happen to have this thing lying around let's get in on it it's shameless i mean i know he's
[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:12.520]   he he likes to make fun about himself about being an industry shill but he is and it's as simple as
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:17.160]   that i'll say he's sue me if he doesn't like it no he absolutely isn't an industry shill and
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:21.880]   unfortunately i think if it were any other administration any other climate you might actually have
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:25.720]   well you're not because it turns out that president trump also
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:32.760]   mamma with singclair executives before this so yep yeah no exactly if you were any other
[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:38.040]   administration this could be a real scandal but come on here this isn't even this doesn't even
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:44.040]   rise no no to the level of interest i know you could i sometimes wonder with senior officials in
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:47.640]   this government if you could you know if there was photographic evidence of them with a shaved
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:52.040]   goat's power level lube they'd still be in the job on no no you know what they do they just say
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:58.200]   i made a mistake i'm going to see the lord i'm going to oh oh and thank you we can use that's
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:04.200]   that's so 2017 they don't apologize they don't even do that anymore
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:08.600]   they would say the photos are fake it's safe news you can't prove it
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:15.960]   okay america america god bless it i'm proud to be an american i ain't going anywhere else but
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:21.320]   sometimes i worry hey i'm hey you're living here you're a citizen i know i'm not a citizen
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:25.720]   yet but i am actually doing the revision and studying for the exams to become a
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:32.760]   washington oh jefferson and i thought i've seen the questions they make you lots of
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:37.000]   ugly that 50 percent of natural born americans could answer this exam all right let's
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.400]   you're not wrong the most high school students couldn't yeah you're exactly right sadly
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:47.240]   let's just ask a few questions from the us citizen exam oh
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:53.720]   okay so you got judiciary executive
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:10:01.640]   let's see here's free citizenship practice tests all right let's let's practice
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:07.160]   uh what is the supreme law of the land it is multiple choice make it easy for you
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:10.600]   the supreme court the bill of rights the declaration of independence of the constitution
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:16.280]   supreme court wrong the last one the last one that's correct but they interpret the
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:21.080]   constitution i always feel that's a super tricky question no the constitution is the right answer
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:28.680]   the idea of self-government is in the first in in the first three weeks of the constitution is in
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:34.760]   the first three words of the constitution what are these words ah we the people we the people yeah
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:38.760]   yeah i'm sorry all the all of the above
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:46.200]   this one says we the people's right uh what is an amendment a change to the constitution
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:51.640]   in addition to the constitution both a and b or none of the above i would say both yeah it's both
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:59.400]   a and b both a and b very good one more one okay what do we call the first ten amendments
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:05.160]   to the rights the bill of rights thank god although the ten commandments was one of the choices
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:11.720]   which in some parts of this country uh those people would uh we know what judge right would
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:17.160]   it's forty percent yeah as jim jeffrey said when people shout to you you can't change the second
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:24.280]   amendments like yes you can it's an amendment that's what it means all right we uh we've now chased
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:29.720]   away uh everybody so we probably should end the show he and tatson he's a brit you can blame him

[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:51.000]   that i just i just remember my revision but i mostly remembered it wrong when it came to number of
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:57.640]   states i think it was president obama said the 52 states so i i think it was coming from a good
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:03.960]   authority uh at yes sir would you like to give us your traditional uh farewell
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:10.520]   yeah yeah so everybody listen if you got kids go to school or even got a co-worker

[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:21.720]   talking about people but check what your kids to make sure that everything in school is okay and
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:27.000]   and start early so they feel comfortable telling you stuff because if all these kids knew that there
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:30.360]   was something wrong with this kid the problem is they're told not to
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:35.720]   rad on people or tell on people or talk about somebody being weird you should talk to your
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:40.600]   kids to find out information is going on their day and if something's making them feel uncomfortable
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:46.840]   that you find out and know um somebody was bullying a girl in my my daughter's class since i talked
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:51.400]   to her it wasn't bullying her but i talked to her told the teacher the kid never went home and told
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:56.040]   her parents she was being bullied she just was dealing with it the teacher went in dealt with the
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:14:00.120]   problem talk to the whole class didn't point anybody out but the point is you got to talk to your kids
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:03.880]   and be your kids lives because you don't want to end up on the news talking about i knew this
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:08.520]   such a such is gonna do this and nobody said anything so start early with your kids especially you
