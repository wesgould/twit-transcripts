[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.500]   We all have things we like to think about.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.700]   Online fraud shouldn't be one of them.
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.480]   Because with every purchase Visa prevents, detects,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.440]   and resolves online fraud.

[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.720]   And for those of you who agree with Robert Scoville
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.000]   that enthusiasts, blogs, and podcasts should not cover business
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.600]   but should cover, I don't know, bits and bytes.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.080]   This is not going to be the show for you.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.920]   This is going to be a business show, I think.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.480]   But we'll see.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.640]   You never know what this bud is starting with Jason Calicanis
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.040]   from Mahalo.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.240]   Hey Jason.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.280]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.480]   I haven't talked to you since you gave up blogging.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.640]   I want to ask you about that.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.960]   But not yet because I want to introduce some more of the panel.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.240]   John C. Devorak is not here.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.720]   He's flying up to Port Angeliz carrying in a couple of keys.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.920]   Yeah, I can't be here.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.400]   But Devorak got orcs high-fought.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.320]   Don't touch my bags if you please, Mr. Customsman.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.640]   Here also, actually in studio, it's really nice to have him,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.440]   Andrew Horowitz.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.040]   He is the disciplined investor.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.560]   Howdy.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.880]   He's wearing his under armor today.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.240]   Why is that the logo, all the kids
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.800]   now wear the under armor and logos?
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.040]   Isn't that an H for horror?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.240]   Oh, is that A-H?
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.560]   I thought it was UA.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.320]   All right, now I understand.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.080]   Andrew is a host of the Discipline Investor podcast.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.440]   It also has the book Discipline Investor,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.960]   which is available on audible.com.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.800]   And you do a bunch of other stuff too.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.040]   Yeah, we have a blog that's pretty popular and actually
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.400]   right for MSN.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.320]   And actually, just starting this week, MSN Strategy Lab.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.720]   One of the five contestants vying
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.880]   for the big prize of winning the press ring, it seems.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.840]   I manage a portfolio live for MSN money.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.000]   Is it a real portfolio or is it a portfolio?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.120]   It's a faux, but the rules are all the same about how
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.440]   I would invest and how you could short.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.520]   You can go long.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.680]   And right now--
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.480]   What's the prize?
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.400]   It's nice.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.960]   What are you thinking?
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.760]   You're not talking about it?
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.800]   I win, it seems.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.360]   That's all it is.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.960]   There's nothing.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   There's no prize.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.440]   There's no prize.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.760]   There's some bragging rights, I guess.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.960]   And it's really what they do.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.840]   It's interesting because what they do it for is really not
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.880]   so much as a competition, although that's part of it,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.600]   of course.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.520]   It's the learning exercise.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.600]   Any time I do buy or sell anything,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.920]   I actually have to send in an entire summary of what I'm doing.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.040]   And that appears on the site.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.000]   That's actually really exciting.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.720]   It's a really nice setup.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.160]   Also here from Business Week, their technology editor,
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.200]   Mr. Peter Elstrom, first time on Twitter.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.560]   Good to have you.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.520]   Hey, Leo, it's good to be here.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.640]   You're in New York City today?
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.360]   I'm actually in the suburbs of New York, up in Westchester,
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.360]   where I live.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.160]   Oh, Westchester.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.920]   Yeah, our offices are in New York City.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.440]   Right.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.280]   Well, it's good to have you on.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.560]   This is a good, auspicious time to have three guys who
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.720]   know something about business on.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.320]   I know, I'm just going to say right now, nothing about business.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.600]   That's why I'm doing 40 hours of video a week on Twit Live
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.040]   for absolutely no money.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.720]   So I'm obviously the wrong person to ask about any of this stuff.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.000]   Actually, I think one of the big stories, the Rackspace IPO.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.840]   We haven't seen an IPO on a while.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.640]   Yeah, we're going to give Bronx a cheer for that one.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.760]   Didn't do so well, did it?
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.880]   No, I have a theory.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.960]   Well, I can tell you why that is, actually.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.200]   One of the big things in IPOs, or if you think about it,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.440]   is it was always put out.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.160]   It would be when the underwriters are involved.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.360]   They have to support it.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   And I think it was coming out.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.840]   I think it was 12 was Rackspace, I believe, or 14,
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   whatever it was, exactly.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.640]   Well, the underwriters don't have the money to support anymore.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.120]   They just don't.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.880]   They have to put their money somewhere else.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.240]   And that's why the last two that I saw, there was a solar one.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.080]   And Rackspace both fell terribly right afterwards.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.440]   What did Rackspace end up down?
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.800]   It was down 20% or something?
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.560]   Stay as terrible.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.720]   I mean, look at my Bloomberg application.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.360]   But I think that's the whole point of the--
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.600]   I think the whole point of these IPOs is that days are numbered.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   If these guys aren't going to hold it up, Goldman or Morgan
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.920]   or whoever else it may be, there is no way
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.720]   that you're going to have people coming out with--
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.360]   I think Black helicopters are flying in.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.840]   What is that?
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   Are they coming to get us?
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.520]   I think Stavora came in to have a pretty angelous.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.400]   He said, wait a minute.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.400]   I've got to be honest.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   I've got to be honest.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   I've got to be honest.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   I've got to be honest.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.120]   He's very serious about his anniversary.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.960]   I plan on coming out here for three months.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.720]   And we talked about it constantly.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.200]   And all the sense is, you know I have to--
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.040]   This is his anniversary.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   Is that what's going on?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.760]   Oh, isn't that sweet?
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.640]   With Mimi, how long have they been married?
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.640]   That woman is an angel.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.040]   She's been around a long time.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.600]   That's what it's been.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.760]   That's all we could say.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.040]   So we have-- I mean, Jason, there hasn't been a--
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.800]   I protect IPO in a long time.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.000]   When's the last tech IPO?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.040]   There's been some semiconductor stuff and some other stuff.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.800]   There have been many IPOs at all, frankly.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.560]   It's been a bad market for that.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.880]   It's actually-- you know what?
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.600]   A lot of the companies now are just--
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.360]   there is much more capital out there
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.160]   available to people from other types of funds.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.680]   They don't need to do the IPO.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.640]   They don't need to do that.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.240]   I mean, you have people like Leg Mason and Fidelity now
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.000]   doing investments in the C&D round, which
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.800]   is a later stage round for venture companies,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.320]   like Slide, like Nang, et cetera.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.760]   And so you see these $30, $40, $50 million rounds.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.000]   They're just basically--
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.320]   it's almost like IPO is happening in private companies.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.800]   They're putting in that level of money.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   Wow.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.520]   And you raise $30, $40, $50, $100 million in an IPO.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.200]   And I have got private people who can put it in.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.840]   And it cost you, I think, probably $1,000,000 a year
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.600]   to be public now because of all the Sarban's Oxley stuff.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.960]   And it's just not worth it.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.120]   That's what Devorex always says.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.040]   Socks is killing the business.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.440]   They like to--
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.000]   Here's the Rackspace graph on Bloomberg.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.160]   It's a good graph.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.040]   That is horrible.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.520]   That's when you only have one day of trading.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.560]   It's just basically--
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.120]   It's 14 to 12, something.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.720]   12 and 1/2 to 10.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   And that was, by the way, on a week
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.560]   when we had a 300 point up on the market.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.640]   I mean, that is horrible.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.000]   What happened in the market, by the way?
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.320]   Why did it-- what happened there?
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.600]   Why did it go up 300 points?
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.240]   Was it the price oil?
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.720]   Yeah, oil prices are finally coming down.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.200]   How long can they come down?
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.720]   Is that-- I mean, that's just a blip, right?
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.960]   I mean, is it really going to come down?
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   This is my hot button here.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.520]   You know, the Enron loophole, not to really get crazy
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.160]   with everybody here.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.640]   But this is unbelievable.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.880]   Back in 2000, there was an opening
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.200]   in the energy area where the Graham pushed a bill through,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.080]   allowed Enron to have these rolling blackouts out here.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.760]   You remember that?
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.260]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.080]   And this was shortage.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.560]   That was all for trading.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.320]   Essentially for last--
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.560]   Screwed California is what they did.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.360]   Totally screwed California.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.080]   Well, this was open.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.520]   This whole same thing never closed up all these years.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.280]   And it was allowing for trading to happen on the ICE
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.040]   outside the parameters of any regulatory body
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.000]   of the United States.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.280]   So all that was trading outside of that.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   And the limits were small.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.120]   Bottom line is they finally-- Feinstein, your senator
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.800]   out here--
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.640]   She actually went and pressed it real hard
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.080]   and put it apart of the farm bill
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.880]   and closed up that loophole.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.960]   And wouldn't you know it?
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.120]   It was finally closed.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.760]   But they left out oil.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.600]   They just closed down heating oil and natural gas.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.640]   And that's why that happened.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.960]   The speculation was the whole problem here.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.360]   The supplied event crap was just bogus.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.080]   The price went up because of speculation.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.960]   The speculation is over so the price is going to stay down.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.400]   And now they're running for the hills.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.560]   And that's good news for us.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.040]   And everybody's happy.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.480]   And you would have seen the whole invasion, the Georgian
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.400]   invasion, you know, Devo went down to Georgia on Friday.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.840]   And why was that in the nightmare?
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.720]   But that should have pushed prices of oil up, right?
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.240]   Didn't.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.340]   Nope.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.440]   And gold came down too.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.600]   So why didn't that scare people that Russia made a Georgia?
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.560]   It may have, but it was--
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.360]   the whole issue of the speculation
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.720]   is just, you know, just push everybody out too quickly.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.080]   All right.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.040]   Enough of--
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.560]   Enough.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.280]   Let's talk about gold.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.200]   You mentioned gold.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.680]   Gold.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.920]   Salon.com, Andrew Leonard, how the world works.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.480]   Great column.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.880]   He writes, yesterday afternoon while my son was upstairs
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.520]   leveling up his blood elf at exalting in his new ostrich

[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   wrote a paper on why gold farming is good for the economies
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.000]   of third world nations.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.320]   Gold farming is making fake gold for world of warcraft.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.520]   Do you understand, right?
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.120]   Alchemy.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120]   Virtual aquifer.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.680]   It's poor people sitting there kind of slogging
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.920]   in and out in world of warcraft.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.160]   And then somebody comes along and gives them
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.480]   real money for all the gold they've earned, fishing,
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.120]   and hunting, and mining.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.320]   Apparently, there's a relationship,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.680]   a parallel between the gold farmers
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.160]   and the treatment of Chinese immigrant labor
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.800]   working laundry shops during the gold rush
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.920]   of the mid to late 19th century in California.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.240]   The same repetitive work in front of a machine,
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.320]   the same association with gold, and similar tropes
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.200]   of associating east Asians with disease and pestilence
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.120]   that justified the need for their extermination.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.520]   What?
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.120]   I don't know.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.200]   World of Warcraft, there's a real economy in there.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.960]   Do you guys have anybody here play World of Warcraft?
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.480]   No, I'm not at the last job.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.680]   Peter, you play?
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.560]   I don't know.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   I don't know.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.880]   It's tough to find the time.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.040]   I just think it's tough to find it.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.480]   Check that out once or twice, but I can't do it.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.920]   I got my level 79 elf and I'll whip your butt.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.240]   Is that way up there, huh?
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.280]   No.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.040]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.360]   Jason, you play World of Warcraft.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.280]   I know you do.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.080]   You know who does?
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.480]   I've got 60 hours of free a week over here.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.240]   You know who does?
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.560]   Joe Ito.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.560]   Joe E, yeah.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.960]   Well, he thinks this is like the next place business
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.920]   is going to happen.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.440]   It's like the golf course of the 21st century.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.200]   No.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.360]   It's crap.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.480]   What happened to you a second life?
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.240]   That was going to be the golf course of the 21st century.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240]   That was the next thing too.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.880]   You know, you walk around, you can buy Hooker's Virtua.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.720]   That's a lot of fun.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.480]   Yeah, I was--
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.480]   Hey now!
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   Joe, he's not lying.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.640]   That's not true.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.080]   You go in there, people buy nude suits
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.640]   and they wander around naked and you
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.240]   can get sexual positions.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.880]   Very weird.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.120]   There's a word I think it's called desperation.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.720]   It's kind of lonely people.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.760]   Only life.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.120]   Ryan air making a nice move.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.360]   This is-- I kind of equate this to Hasbro's move
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.440]   with the scrabulous folks.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.840]   Ryanair has decided that it will not--
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.720]   Ryanair is the Irish discount airline
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.080]   that makes it very cheap to fly around your opinion.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.840]   20 bucks, right?
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.880]   I mean, it's like a bus.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.200]   But it's really-- it's been huge.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.800]   Is that a BYOB or a BYO chair or something?
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.200]   A BYO chair, yeah.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.000]   It's huge for the economy of Europe because--
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.360]   Break your own jet fuel.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.960]   These workers now, because they're
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.120]   you citizens, they can travel around very easily
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.760]   and Ryanair makes it very possible.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.000]   They said yesterday they're going to anow
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.920]   all bookings made through third party websites.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.720]   You book a flight through, say, lastminute.com,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.760]   which is a very popular site, V2-ers, Tuu-i, Oppoto.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.280]   You book a book-- a Ryanair ticket there.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.920]   I mean, this is money going to Ryanair.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.000]   It's not like they're stealing money from Ryanair.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.760]   Ryanair is going to cancel the booking.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.800]   And then what?
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.920]   They'll give them refunds.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.800]   And then the people have to book it again?
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.680]   Yeah, they-- I guess--
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.360]   How many can they do that?
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.440]   It's completely insane.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.000]   And this is the same idea as--
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.920]   I don't know what-- is the deep linking
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.760]   lawsuits of a few years ago.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.600]   Yeah, this is just like Ticketmaster, I guess,
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.440]   where Ticketmaster didn't want people to deep link to their stuff.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.000]   And now there's no way to use--
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.120]   the same way like sidestep and kayak
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.400]   can create these really interesting looks at the data,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.600]   these meta search engines.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.800]   Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.320]   What's wrong with this?
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.960]   Well, it brings you business except what they've found,
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.400]   I think, is they don't want people comparing the prices.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.080]   And most people are too lazy to.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.160]   And if they let one of these other people
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.080]   get a hold of the consumers, then it's
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.240]   going to cause them problems down the road.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.200]   So it's sort of like the music industry gets in bed
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.080]   with Steve Jobs and the iTunes store.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.480]   And now they're like, oh my god, now we've
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.240]   got this juggernaut to deal with.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.160]   I think Ticketmaster didn't want to make a secondary ticket
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.560]   market that they would have to then deal with if they caught on
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.920]   and had a lot of traffic.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.560]   So that's probably Ryan who was trying to do is not
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.120]   have somebody become a layer on top of them.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.160]   Last thing we want is intelligent consumers
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.600]   that we can't rip them off as easily.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.920]   Well, yeah, and efficient ones, right?
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.360]   Right.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.520]   Efficiency's bad for our business.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.440]   Not to bring-- what is it?
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.040]   The six degrees of Kevin Bacon, right?
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.880]   Because he's the degrees of John de Vorac, everything relates
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.480]   to him.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.120]   But didn't something he just his son do a deal with?
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.280]   It's down.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:49.800]   It's down.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.440]   They shut him down.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.440]   They shut him down.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.520]   He was doing a same kind of thing, where he was--
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.280]   instead of going to Craigslist, we could find one area.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.640]   He was doing a massive search of the entire database.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.760]   Craig's-- it was called Craig's Finder.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.360]   And Craig's F-I-N-D-R dot com.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.200]   And it was-- I thought a great idea.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.320]   John mentioned it on the show, I think, last week,
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.080]   saying he's just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.800]   It dropped.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.640]   It dropped.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.480]   It dropped.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.240]   Craig's list is blocking Craig's Finder.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.960]   If you go to savecraigsfinder.com,
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.560]   there's a whole bunch of stuff on there.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.240]   And John actually did say, can you please mention this?
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.720]   Because his son is miffed.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.280]   This is a little different, though,
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.200]   because they're scraping information off Craigslist.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   Right, but if you read what the response is,
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.160]   it's totally a joke.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.560]   The response is that they got asking why is this,
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.720]   and they gave him back a response,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.840]   why they didn't want this to happen.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.960]   It's a total joke, why it's not being allowed.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.680]   It's ridiculous.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.120]   Well, what?
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.280]   They don't want somebody in between them and their customers.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:51.760]   Is that the idea?
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.000]   Well, the way Craig's list works, you eat local, right?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.320]   So you go to San Francisco, or you go to New York.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.520]   You don't go to both.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.640]   You have to go one at a time.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.200]   So the Craig's Finder scraped them all.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.280]   And so you could combine multiple locations of Craig's list
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.120]   and do a search that way.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.400]   Now, why they wouldn't--
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.200]   Now, the difference is that Ryan Ayers
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.040]   getting the money for the booking.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.720]   The difference here is, Craig's--
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.040]   I don't know how Craig's list makes money.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.840]   Does anybody know how Craig makes any money?
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.360]   It's not--
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.040]   There's no ads.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040]   It's not some of the--
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.400]   It's not some of the--
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.880]   --how Jason, explain this.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.520]   They charge for jobs and real estate listings
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.880]   in certain cities.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.160]   So in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.760]   you post a job, you post an apartment.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.880]   They charge 75, whatever.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.480]   So not all listings are free.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.280]   They have some charge.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.080]   Because there's no ads.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.600]   99.9% of listing categories are free.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.680]   They just basically waited till they hit critical mass
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.040]   in the top, like five markets, 10 markets.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.600]   And they turned it on when you really have no choice,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.200]   but to use those markets.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.960]   And it makes probably $30 million a year of the company,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.240]   maybe 40 or 50.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:51.880]   Interesting.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.400]   No design costs.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.480]   It's making a lot of money.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.840]   No design costs, no.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.360]   It's all text.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.200]   No design costs.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.600]   Now, that's interesting, though, because that runs
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   counter to the notion that once you give away something--
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.720]   this is Twitter's problem, right?
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.320]   Once you give something away for free,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.640]   isn't it impossible to go back and charge a money for it?
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.600]   But I guess it is with Craig anyway.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.920]   And the way people feel about it is, oh my god,
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.640]   Craig's list is such a great service.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.480]   And everything's totally free.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.400]   If I have to post a job, $25 or $50,
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.080]   it's not such a big deal.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.840]   Well, it's usually the employer that's paying money, right?
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.280]   It's not the employee's looking for jobs.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.720]   So the employers want to find somebody
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.560]   and they'll pay a little bit of debt.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.880]   That's good money, isn't it?
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.000]   I mean, on a lot of sites, I mean, for a while,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.400]   we even looked at doing a Twitch job site,
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.480]   because there's good money in these job listing sites, right?
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.960]   Yeah, well, I mean, you're looking at people
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.400]   spend 20%, 30% of the person's salary
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.640]   when they use a headhunter.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.720]   So when you're looking at 10, 20, $30,000 fees to headhunter's,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.360]   $150, $400, that seems-- if you can get qualified resumes
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.280]   to be pretty cheap.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.000]   I mean, and the reason-- that's the reason why local newspapers
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.560]   are having so much of a problem.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.040]   So what basically Craig's list did was they said, OK,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.880]   let's take the entire 100% market of job listings
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.160]   and classifieds.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.880]   Let's shrink it down, make it free, except for this 1%.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.560]   And they didn't have any percent.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.680]   So for that making 30, 40, 50 million a year,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.560]   the 1% of the classified industry is great for them,
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.200]   but they basically destroyed the entire industry
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.320]   to take their one little slice.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.560]   It's brilliant.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.800]   This is the challenge for the newspaper industry, right?
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.880]   They're getting that small slice of revenue
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.320]   and sucking it out of the newspapers across the country.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   So that's why they're going out of business.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.440]   Here's my question.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.280]   Why would Craig's find her hurt Craig's list?
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.800]   I'll tell you the reason why Craig says it,
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.200]   because this is like maybe the 10th time
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.760]   that they've shut these things down, and I know him.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.680]   He'll fall back to the community.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.560]   We don't have permission from our community
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.760]   to we syndicate our stuff, and the community doesn't want it.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.040]   So he sort of falls back on what he knows of the community.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.320]   Craig's list is a web 1.0 company.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.880]   It wasn't intended to be like, oh, we have an API.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.880]   Go take our stuff and go make derivative services out of it.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.680]   And they don't want to make these visualizations.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.440]   So the other company that made a visualization service out of it
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.240]   got shut down.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.280]   They basically scraped the entire thing,
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.240]   and they took all the pictures, and they said, OK,
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.720]   search for one bedroom, two bedroom, a three bedroom,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.880]   and we'll show you a grid of all the pictures.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.720]   It's a pretty cool idea, right?
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.000]   And they shut that down, too.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   So they're basically saying, our community doesn't want it,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.040]   which is sort of--
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.240]   That's BS.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.040]   That makes no sense.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.160]   It's sort of BS, yeah.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.480]   But basically, it's their data.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.240]   It's their business.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.920]   They're saying we've created a business
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.480]   with a significant barrier to entry,
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   so we can sit on our ass and make a crappy site that
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.840]   doesn't have any of the features of any modern website.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.080]   And you can't do it either.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.920]   But because we dominate, no one else can come in.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.440]   So what?
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.120]   Too bad.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.640]   Yeah, but that's a death nail for them.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.880]   If somebody comes in behind him--
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.440]   Can somebody come in?
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   Yeah, somebody come in behind him.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.000]   Obviously, they have huge momentum,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   and they're an issue in what they do,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.680]   because it's cheap, and it's the garage sale of the web.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.440]   I've got a new site.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.600]   I want to do cool lists.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.440]   C-U-I-L-L-I-S-T.com.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.800]   And we'll just be a better Craigslist.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   What do you think?
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.280]   Spilling.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.480]   Spilling is working on it.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.160]   It's Irish for rich, I think.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.040]   B-O-ch.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.000]   I think B-O-ch is in there.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.640]   B-O-ch?
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.880]   Yeah, I'm rich B-O-ch.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.400]   There isn't a direct translation in Gaelic to B-O-ch.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:10.920]   Mm.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.760]   But--
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.960]   But somebody can come behind Craigslist,
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.160]   and then they're just going to be in big trouble.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.680]   You think?
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.040]   Yeah, well--
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   So there isn't such a significant barrier to entry.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.120]   I don't think so.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.760]   Well, there's no barrier to entry except brand.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.880]   And a 10-year-old brand like that, very hard to just--
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.800]   I wonder if you did something that was really good that
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.080]   was a mashup, like this Google Map mashup.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.000]   What if you did something really good?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.400]   In order to get people to switch a service,
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.960]   it's going to require hitting them somewhere between three
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.000]   and seven times with a marketing message.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.880]   And it's requiring having a product which is probably
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.200]   50% 100% times better.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.000]   So you can't just make it 10% better,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.120]   because there are search engines that are 10% better
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.360]   than Google or whatever.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.120]   But to get people to switch off a brand,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.320]   there is zero switching cost, theoretically,
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.840]   you type in a different domain name.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.960]   But it means you have to market the heck out of it
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.640]   to displace it.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.120]   So if somebody wanted to start, this seven days in tech--
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.840]   and show that twice as good, it's going to take them
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.520]   a couple of years to do it.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.040]   Yeah, good.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.240]   Thank God.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.880]   Because I'm basically resting on my butt.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.840]   In a world where everything's a commodity, brand
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.160]   becomes the differentiator, brand becomes the defensibility.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.080]   Good.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.960]   Tom Peters, didn't Tom Peters say that a product
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.560]   to replace supplant another product has to be--
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.480]   not twice as good, not three--
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.960]   has to be 10 times as good to supplant another product
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.040]   with an established brand.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.720]   You know what you got?
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.800]   You know what you have?
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.320]   You know what you--
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.040]   Why take the chance?
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.320]   You can see a significant improvement.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.520]   And Craigslist does the job.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.200]   People use it.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.480]   Does the work.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.400]   Could be better.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.600]   But here's what I hate.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.360]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.040]   I hate seeing somebody say, yeah, so you can't beat us,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.160]   so I don't have to innovate.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   I don't have to do anything.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.560]   And I can dump on innovators, because I
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.000]   don't have to improve.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.600]   That's kind of sad, don't you think?
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.640]   Come on, Craig, talk to Craig, Jason, will you?
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.600]   Well, he's a friend of mine.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.400]   I mean, the other thing I--
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.080]   He's a nice guy, but he's not Mr. Excitement.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.200]   Here's the thing.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.480]   Not everybody has to have the same philosophy
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.000]   of how to run a business and what they should be allowed--
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.560]   people should be allowed to do with their data.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.440]   Kevin Rose from Dig thinks it should be open to a point.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.080]   He's not letting people create totally open search engines
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.640]   based on his data.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.040]   Delicious believes that there should be open,
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.920]   except you can't go make a search engine with it.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.120]   So when you start getting down and peeling back the onion,
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.480]   even the people who are open and have APIs,
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.200]   they open and have APIs to a point,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.160]   not to the point at which you create a really valuable business.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.680]   So I kind of think the whole API and openness thing
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.840]   is really disingenuous.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.560]   And it's kind of refreshing for someone like Craig
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.440]   to be like, you know what?
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.040]   It's my data.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.920]   I built this business.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.240]   You don't have a right to it.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:44.980]   Sorry.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.840]   If you want to start from scratch, go ahead.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.600]   Whereas some of the other people are saying, oh, yeah,
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.760]   you can build anything you want unless you
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.040]   start infringing on the business.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.000]   So they basically make the throttles into the API
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.680]   and the rules such that you can't
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.800]   build a compelling business on it.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.560]   But Jason, the only difference here is now.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.240]   Also at Craigslist.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:03.680]   Go ahead.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.600]   I think also at Craigslist, we had the chance recently
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.600]   to talk with Jim Buckmaster there.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.200]   And it seems like they're very focused on the community
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.000]   and what their community wants.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.840]   And they're less concerned with if some business partner wants
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.520]   to come in and try to build something on top
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.720]   is just less of a concern to them, I think.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.480]   So you're telling me the community
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.640]   won't want greater exposure and people
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.200]   to find them in a much more efficient manner?
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.680]   That just doesn't make any sense?
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.920]   I mean, if you were to present it to them that way,
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.280]   they may respond positively.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.040]   But I think it's not what they're asking for.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.320]   It's a red herring.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.240]   That's a total red herring, that argument.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.360]   It's like, oh, we don't really--
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.520]   our community doesn't want it.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.080]   It's just like-- that's basically a way of saying,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:45.880]   you know what?
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.800]   Stay out of our business.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.320]   Exactly.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:47.680]   It's mine.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.960]   This is mine and you're not part of it.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.920]   Nananapuru.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.360]   It's interesting culture clash, really, between Eric here,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.120]   who is a Johnson, who is really of this new generation,
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.520]   this open API, scrape everything, mash up generation,
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.440]   and the older generation, Craig and Jim, who are just really
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.680]   saying, no, this is what we do.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.960]   It's plain white paper, black text.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.840]   The younger generation has the belief
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.600]   that it's a sort of technological determinism where,
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.200]   if I can technically achieve something, then it is allowable.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.720]   Right.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.640]   And that's exactly how Napsterfeld, that
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.800]   was the first example of it.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.040]   I technically made this happen.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.960]   Therefore, it's allowable.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.160]   How can you stop it?
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.120]   And that's actually how these young people think.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.200]   They think, well, you can't stop me, and I can just scrape it.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.240]   And if you block my IP, I'll get other IPs,
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.280]   and I'll keep doing it.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.720]   And they don't actually-- they're so young and naive
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.160]   that they don't understand that there's law,
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.240]   and that there's fairness, and that there's ethics.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.000]   Well, it's the title--
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.240]   It's the title and generation.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:43.760]   It's what it is.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.000]   Well, I wonder, though, who's going to win?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.160]   Aren't they going to win in the long run?
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.280]   Isn't that the future?
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:47.800]   We all die.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.560]   No, I don't think it--
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.160]   Well, we all die.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.720]   We-- what are you talking about?
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.320]   Unless you take the history of--
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.800]   you take our entire legal structure and playing field,
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.400]   and you throw it out, the answer is no, actually.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.040]   I mean, YouTube, in fact, is an example of that techno
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.480]   sort of determinism.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.280]   Oh, well, we were able to create this platform.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.160]   Anybody should be able to do whatever they want.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.680]   And the madness of the mob rules.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.600]   And then, all of a sudden, Viacom says, no.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.560]   Or Craigslist says, no.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.600]   And the way I try to explain to people
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.360]   is this young generation has to learn about the concept
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.560]   of fairness.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.920]   There's fair use, like what you're
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.960]   able to do legally and fair use.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.480]   But then there's also this concept of being fair.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.080]   If you build a business based on Craigslist business,
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.960]   you owe them something.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.960]   Yes.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.480]   Yes.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.560]   And so you need to go to them and ask permission.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.060]   Right.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.040]   I wanted to take Twit and remix it.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.960]   I should go ahead and say, hey, Leo, I have this idea.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.440]   I want to put Twit onto a P2P network,
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.160]   and I'm going to share it with people.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.600]   You would give permission to me.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.800]   Well, here's an interesting thing.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.920]   And I think this is where the new generation, the old generation,
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.580]   differ.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.560]   Twit is licensed with a Creative Commons license.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.520]   It lets you do exactly that for non-commercial purposes.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.320]   Non-commercial without permission, as long as you attribute it.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.760]   Now, as soon as you start charging,
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.120]   then obviously you need permission.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.720]   But that's a choice I made in terms of licensing.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.520]   It's a choice a lot of people are making nowadays
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.960]   in terms of licensing.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.800]   And I think it's kind of the new generation.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.920]   The new generation recognizes the--
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.240]   and maybe the pendulum has swung toward the commons.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.680]   They recognize what Larry Lisey caused, the tragedy, the commons,
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.560]   the need to have this stuff be available to work on.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.960]   In fact, there's a great article in the August 11th New Yorker
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.520]   by James Surawicki, who wrote The Wisdom of Crowds.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.680]   He calls it the permission problem.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.960]   He says, a lot of innovation is stifled by the fact
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.240]   that they have all these different business interests who
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.520]   can't act economically rationally.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.720]   He gives us an example of an oil field
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.560]   where it turns out if too many people wildcat the oil field,
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.520]   it's bad for everybody.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.600]   You get less oil total out of it than if one company gets
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.200]   the rights to it.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.840]   He says the economically rational thing
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.080]   would be for one company say, I'm
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.960]   going to give you all a little bit of share.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.800]   We'll all make more money if you let me
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.080]   have exclusive rights to it.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   That very rarely happens, if ever, even though that's
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.600]   economically rational behavior.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.920]   And so it's an interesting issue.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.120]   Look, what happened with Hasbro and Scrabulous?
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.560]   Businessweek just had a very good article.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.800]   What has Hasbro learns to spell B-O-T-C-H?
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.080]   Love that time.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.480]   But this is a great segue to the whole discussion of blogging.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.160]   So much of blogging is just a cut and paste,
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.840]   and a one line sent in one of the financial world, especially
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.720]   one line about what it is.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.800]   Where's the originality?
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.840]   Where is the sanctity of someone's own idea
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.800]   and having some of their own idea?
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.200]   I just call that reblogging.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.800]   Yeah, so it's unbelievable.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.440]   And Jason, I was writing for AOL blogging stocks.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.960]   I still officially write for them when I choose.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.680]   But so much of that is just repurposed information over
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.480]   and over, and it's this giant vat to get through the information
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.080]   is just unbelievable.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.200]   And there's people like, well, this shows an example.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.840]   Well, we don't generate new information, new news.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.000]   We rehash old news, but we add opinion and analysis on top of it.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.200]   There are people who add value.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.800]   Well, a good blog is going to add value.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.160]   Correct.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:07.680]   Correct.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.080]   I mean, Walt Disney didn't make up Cinderella.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.680]   Walt Disney didn't make up Snow White.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.400]   Walt Disney didn't even make up Mickey Mouse.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.600]   And yet they might want to assert the rights in perpetuity.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.640]   That was there was some enhanced brain enhancing things
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.080]   that helped him through that, I believe.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.280]   I want to actually ask you, Jason, just a sec,
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.720]   as if we talked last week about the weblogs, Inc.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.040]   Froufera.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.000]   And maybe you can give us some insight into what's going on over there.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.520]   It sounded like, according to, they was Devorek or Harris last week
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.000]   said they're just going to stop paying the guys, basically.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.040]   Also, Propeller, which was your creation at AOL, seems to be foundry.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.800]   I want to ask you about both those things.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.680]   But before I do, that's called a tease.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.400]   I do want to mention that this show is brought to you by the good folks at Visa.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.800]   You know, when you bought, it's funny, since we started doing these ads for Visa,
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.600]   I'd be getting more and more email.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.680]   It's so great from people.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.880]   Time after time, we said, yeah, you know what?
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.160]   We got ripped off online.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.960]   We called Visa and they immediately made it good.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.240]   And they pursued the guy.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.520]   They didn't say, oh, no, let's see if we can get your money back.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.080]   They made it good right away.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.160]   Visa knows you've got better things to think about when it comes to shopping online,
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.440]   whether you want to get that Tesla or the Roadster, maybe the four door.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.200]   It's a tough decision.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.880]   You shouldn't be thinking about whether you're going to get defrauded.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.360]   All the purchases you make with Visa are safe and secure.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:31.240]   They use a lot of very sophisticated online software and technologies to prevent, detect,
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.000]   and resolve online fraud.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   You know what?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.480]   You don't need to know the sophisticated stuff they're doing.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.360]   You just need to know two words, zero liability.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.400]   You are not liable for unauthorized purchases.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.120]   You're safe online with Visa.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.280]   That's peace of mind safe, secure, Visa.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.440]   Keep those emails coming into.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.680]   I'll start quoting some of those.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.880]   So you could use the Visa to set up your Audible account?
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.280]   Yes, you could, but that'll come later.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   Okay, you're checking.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.160]   Thank you so much, Andrew.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.920]   That's really frankly, that's Jason's job to bring in the Audible.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.000]   Visa, Visa, great card.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Had one my whole life.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Home wife.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.640]   I went through my wallet.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.880]   All Visa?
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.880]   All the time?
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.880]   I have one American Express card.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.880]   Is that okay?
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   Well, I tell you something.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.920]   Visa, yeah, of course it's okay.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:22.160]   Visa, great for if you're selling something online, it's a very low merchant fee.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.440]   We sell tickets to some of that.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.200]   See, that's the problem with American Express.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.880]   It's a huge cut, isn't it?
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.880]   They think it's a big cut.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.880]   Double.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   I think it's like one and a half versus three and a half, four percent.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   It's crazy.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.280]   I mean, what you have to pay for, that's why a lot of restaurants, like smaller restaurants
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.320]   that have low price food, they're like, "No, American Express, sorry."
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   Because four percent.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   You know what's weird?
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   Explain this to me.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.520]   I went to Costco.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.320]   They won't take anything but American Express.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.320]   They got some deal.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.320]   They're going to express pay the ball.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.320]   There's a five percent deal.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   That's sponsorship deal.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   It's got to be.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   That pisses me off.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   But now they have the plum card.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   You know, they black card, they have the blue card, they have the plum card.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.320]   Plum card.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.320]   Do you have a black card, Andrew?
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.320]   No, I don't.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   Jason, do you have a black card?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   No, comment.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.320]   He has a black card.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.960]   Do you have a plum card?
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.400]   I got it offered the black card.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.280]   And this is how cheap I am.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.720]   I grew up so broke and poor that I just, I can't spend money on so much.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.560]   What's the yearly fee on a black card?
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   $4,500.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.920]   So my guy, you know, I got a guy and you know, he manages the stuff.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.800]   He's like, "Oh, what do you need?
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   Is anything you want?
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   I get you anything you want.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   What do you want?
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   You get it like a concierge.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.680]   You basically, so my money manager got it.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.240]   So he's like, "You want a black card?
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   I got black cards both the way."
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   No problem.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.240]   And I'm like, "Oh yeah, like a black card."
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   And he's like, "It's great.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   It's made of metal."
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   I'm like, "Okay, well, how is it?"
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   It is made of metal.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   And I'm like, "You could slice your meat with it.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   You could slice the steak."
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.520]   The thing is, it is literally metal.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.520]   I mean, it's impressive.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.520]   And I'm like, "Okay, well, that's cool.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.520]   Maybe I'll get one."
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   And he's like, "$4,500."
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.520]   I was like, "What do I get versus my platinum card?"
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   You get a concierge.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.680]   And he goes, "It's the same thing."
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   No, same thing.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680]   He gets the concierge with the platinum card.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.680]   It's the same thing.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.120]   And the only reason I, the only reason I pay for the platinum card, which is $400 a year,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.200]   is because you get free companion ticket when you buy a full class.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.000]   When you spend $3,000 on a business class ticket.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   You know what?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.560]   I do a ton of speaking gigs.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.360]   And when I do speaking gigs, my guy Tyler sets it up and he says, "We'll buy the ticket.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   We'll buy the ticket.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360]   And then I can bring my wife."
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   Perfect.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   Because they pay for the first class.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   I went to...
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.360]   That's a great idea.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.360]   I have to do that from now on.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   When you just...
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.040]   In Asia, I just came back on Cathay Pacific's business class.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   Wow.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.040]   That was unbelievable.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.040]   I know that's $50,000.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   It was...
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.920]   $28,000 for first class.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   But it was...
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.920]   Business class was...
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   But I don't pay for that.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.920]   I mean, it's all miles.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.920]   The whole trip is all miles.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.920]   Right.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   But you know what?
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.920]   I got a platinum card.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   Oh, look at that.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.920]   Because they could helicopter us out of Egypt if we'd gotten sick.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.920]   Oh, that's good.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   That was the only reason.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   That's the perfect...
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.800]   Platinum's the perfect, like, good deal.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.080]   If you get sick in Egypt.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.080]   You know what?
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.080]   I'm so cheap.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.920]   I'm like addicted to finding the $300 round trip flight.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.920]   You know, I like to go on.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.280]   Well, don't do it on Ryanair.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.280]   Yeah, really.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.720]   And don't scrape those sights.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   I love...
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   Do you use that sidecar?
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   What is it called?
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   Sidecar?
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   Sidestep?
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   I love that.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.720]   Sidestep and kayak and all that stuff.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.960]   So how do you get a good ferry if you're so cheap, Mr. Jason Calcase?
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.960]   What do you do?
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.960]   What's your ticket?
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.280]   I go to my assistant and say, "Find the cheap straw."
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   What does he do?
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   Hey now.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   Hey now.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.720]   This is called cheap...
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   Weird cheap.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   Like cheap with the wrong reason.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.720]   Like Thurston Howell cheap.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.840]   Well, I just want to get the lowest fare.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.920]   So I go to my personal assistant and say...
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.640]   So I told assistant number two.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.440]   If you could see the IRC room right now, it's like this week in rich people.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.440]   It is.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   It's this week in rich people.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.600]   So when you travel with your staff, Jason, do you use it like business class when they
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   sit coach?
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.600]   Actually, yeah.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.560]   I did that once with Dane.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   I felt so guilty.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.560]   I swapped seats.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   Dane, come up here.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.560]   Sit back there.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.800]   No, I don't feel bad about it all.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   You know why?
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   Because I busted my ass so long.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   I'm sorry if I can't say ass.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   You can say ass.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.080]   I busted my ass so long in coach.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.600]   And I fly, I do three, four trips a month.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   I'm 37 years old.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   I'm old now.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.600]   I get my back.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.560]   You know, it's like one thing if I can get a business class to go once in a while, it's
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.560]   okay.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.040]   So Peter, you're like me.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.040]   We're sitting here.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   We're impoverished journalists.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.040]   We cover these rich guys.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   We interviewed these rich guys.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.040]   This is making nauseous?
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.040]   It doesn't sound familiar.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.040]   No.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   It's making you sick.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.040]   It's making me sick.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.040]   I got two little kids.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.040]   That's tough to go.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.040]   Any place with two little kids.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.600]   Wait until they get to college age, Peter.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.600]   Let me tell you.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.040]   The good news is when you cover my company, you have all the power over me.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.920]   You can just totally flood it.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.320]   When I was a journalist, that was what I loved.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.240]   I'd be interviewing billionaires like, you know, the first time I met Mark Cuban, I
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.960]   wrote a, you know, it's destroyed broadcast.com and editorial and he had to deal with me and
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.800]   we got in a fight in the lobby of the NASDAQ bill.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   That must have felt good.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   It was hysterical.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   I didn't even want it to become a good friend.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.960]   I remember when I was on MSNBC on the site and I did a commentary.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.560]   It was when Internet Explorer 3.0 came out and I said, sell your Netscape stock.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.040]   I said, shut the place down.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.880]   It's over.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.800]   I'm told Mark and Driessen just hit the rev.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   We've never, I've never been.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.880]   Remember you said, let's get Mark and Driessen on the show?
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.880]   Jason.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.880]   Very supportive about it.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.880]   I don't think he'll ever come on a show with me.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.880]   Well, he was a very cool guy.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   He might have forgotten by now.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   That was 1996.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   That was a while ago.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.880]   He listens to the show too, I think.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   Well, Mark, I apologize.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   I just want to point out I was right.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.760]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   When they got bought credit to him, they were making $600 million.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.040]   Yeah, they were doing fine.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.560]   I was like servers and software.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.600]   And yeah, so I was making a point.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.840]   I wasn't trying to say really, you know, obviously it's not all over.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.960]   But once Mike Grisoff got to Internet Explorer 3, it really was all over.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.200]   I mean, they were going to dominate.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.520]   So they're going to dominate?
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.520]   We talk about it.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.520]   In the browser.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.520]   In the browser.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.720]   And what it's interesting, I'm thinking it's amazing is Mozilla has come right back.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.120]   And it's what, you know, 60%, 70% market share.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.120]   It's amazing.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.120]   Well, so much better.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.120]   So much better.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.120]   I mean, it's just, there's no question.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.200]   So Safari is hands down the best browser.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.200]   You think?
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.520]   Fast is most stable.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.800]   It's so much better than Firefox now.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.200]   It doesn't have a lot of plug-ins.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.520]   I know, but you know what I do?
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.800]   I keep Firefox open when I need to use a plug-in, like a delicious bookmark.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.320]   And 90% of my browsing is in Safari or WebKit, which is like the open source base of Safari.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.120]   WebKit.org, you get that the daily build.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.800]   Oh, so fast, the daily builds.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.640]   It's so much faster than even Safari.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:22.520]   Jason, do they do something with the tonality and the colors of, you know, do they make it
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.520]   richer?
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.520]   Seriously, it looks richer.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.520]   What, Safari?
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   When you're in Safari, everything looks richer.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.520]   I think it's the minimal nature of the...
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.800]   Actually, I'm going to tell you something.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.120]   You know, Andrew's not wrong.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.040]   Safari is the only browser that actually does the proper thing with colors.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040]   It does look better.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.600]   As a matter of fact, you're absolutely right.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.520]   Safari pays attention to color profiles.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.840]   All the other browsers don't.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.840]   Hmm.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.840]   So...
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.840]   That's interesting.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.840]   Or something, whoever we...
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   I think, yeah.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   Let me see.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   Let's try it.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.840]   Let me go to...
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   I'd love to see other...
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.080]   So you guys, what do you think of the opening ceremonies?
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.240]   You think this is...
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.760]   I twittered, ladies and gentlemen, you've just seen the beginning of the Chinese century.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.320]   I think it's very clear China was making a very clear statement.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.960]   They were saying, "Not only do we have a lot of people who can do exactly what we say
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.720]   in perfect unison, but we've got the technology too."
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:19.200]   When he started walking around that wall, you know, to light the flame?
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.440]   Amazing.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.600]   My jaw was hanging open.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.440]   I mean, it was artistically brilliant, but it was also technologically very...
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.720]   What did you think, Jason?
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.600]   I only saw the drumming part of it.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   I didn't see the...
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.600]   That was enough.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   The drumming part, guys.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.160]   I just said to myself, like only the Chinese would create this incredible technology to
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.400]   make all these drums and then stuff and then say, "Oh yeah, let's make it manual and put
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   it five...
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.880]   How many was 5,000 people?
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.880]   2008."
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.040]   So they're like, "Okay, let's put 2,000 people on the floor to run these, obviously,
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.440]   you know, technology sophisticated devices."
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:53.360]   That is the perfect metaphor and you're correct of what the world is going to look like.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:58.120]   You know, 2 billion people with massive amounts of technology is a lot more...
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.200]   You know, it's very intriguing how the world's going to change.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.720]   I think it was extremely compelling and very interesting and it was a clear message.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:09.440]   You know, they said on the TV announcer said that in the rehearsals, they finally had to
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.400]   tell these drummers smile because it was so scary.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.640]   These guys were frowning serious in perfect synchrony.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   You got to figure they're probably from the Chinese army, right?
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.480]   Well, I mean, it made it look like it was...
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.240]   I mean, it did look a little Nuremberg, you know, not to...
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.760]   Not to go Nazi on the show 30...
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.760]   What are we, 42 minutes in?
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.160]   The Gotland's law has now been officially...
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.880]   First Nazi reference 42 minutes in, but it did look a little Nuremberg, you know, stormtrooper
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:40.280]   kind of situation where like, "Okay, these people could be also carrying rifles."
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   You know, but you know what?
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:48.880]   I'll say any country that is putting people in jail for free speech and does not have
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.320]   a democratic process is not going to be able to compete in the way, you know, we may be,
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.120]   you know, whatever, less than 15% of the size of their country, but they're a massive
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.120]   size.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   Yeah, but they're a massive size.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.520]   Do you think that's true in SCI?
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.520]   I wonder.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.560]   I would think a totalitarian, a well-run totalitarian regime like say the Nazis.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.440]   What an economic machine they made out of a very small country that very nearly...
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.280]   Not innovation.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.520]   Innovation works best when you have a free market and a free people because people are
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.960]   not going to invest their lives playing in a rigged game.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.760]   That assumes that they know any differentiates.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.760]   Rigged game.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.760]   What's that?
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.760]   That's...
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.320]   First of all, we're in a rigged game now, but that's a different discussion.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   We just don't see it that way.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.320]   You know, they don't see it that way.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   That way, that's true.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.640]   They don't see it that way either.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.760]   You don't necessarily know that you're in a rigged game when the game's rigged if it's
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   being done correctly.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.600]   Or if you're a nationalist and you say, "I see my country succeeding."
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.120]   Look, you've got to understand China went from the worst possible third world nation
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.800]   50 years ago to...
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.720]   Maybe they're still not a first world nation, but they're moving fast.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.680]   Peter, what do you think?
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.680]   Peter Elstrom.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.320]   Well, I'm amazed at how fast the economy has been able to come on.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.560]   You're talking about double digit growth for a good number of years.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:04.720]   So maybe it doesn't have all the liberties that we have right now.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.520]   But as an economic power, they're certainly coming on strong.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.960]   I think it's a really interesting question you raised, Jason, is do you need a democracy
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.720]   in capitalism for innovation?
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.240]   If you're going to have...
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.440]   Yeah, if you're going to be a competitive, you're going to need that because you're not
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.880]   going to get investment and stuff like that in young people doing stuff like this because
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.280]   I know VCs, I know one VC invested in a company over there, and this is a couple of years
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.080]   ago, probably less chance for having now, and then they invested in the company and
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.800]   then all the company was gone.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.880]   And they're like, where'd the company go?
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.360]   And then the government basically just took the company.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.440]   Jason, you're showing your age right now.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.480]   Let me just give you something to consider.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   You ready?
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.320]   Roman Empire.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.080]   The fact of the matter is that what we've had now is the last 50 years has been an extraordinary
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   revolution.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.800]   And we've seen things that have come on so fast compared to what it's been like.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.040]   But that does not necessarily has to be the plan moving forward.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.960]   The sheer strength, I mean, consider what's going on in China.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.200]   1.3, 1.4, tomorrow 1.5 billion people there.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.400]   I mean, the amount of materials, the amount, I mean, if you think that you eat one chicken
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.800]   a week per person in China, it's 50 billion chickens a year.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.040]   I'm really putting all those chickens.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.040]   It's unbelievable.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.040]   It's unbelievable.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.040]   They're good.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.040]   They're good.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.600]   I feel like where are they putting it all?
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   Where are they putting the chickens?
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   What's happening here?
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   No, let me tell you a second.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.800]   You can't put the freedom genie back in the bottle.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.480]   And so I believe that it's going to be a democracy.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.480]   I agree.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.080]   I don't think it's going to take that long.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.520]   I think it's moving very rapidly that way.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.880]   Well, last week they put people in jail before the Olympic started.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.360]   No, they'll keep trying that.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.760]   But I don't think you're too far off.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.600]   You're doing it successfully.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.040]   And a lot of kids died in that earthquake.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040]   Yes, terrible.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.480]   A lot of people were trying to do investigations into what happened and the buildings and who
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   were responsible.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.160]   I have family over there.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:13.320]   They basically bought them all off and shut them all down.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:18.480]   The freedom of speech, in order to have true capitalism and free markets and true innovation,
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.800]   you must have freedom of speech and you must have a free country.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.200]   You're just not going to be able to keep up.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.360]   We got to the bomb before Hitler did, right?
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.360]   But barely.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.360]   Yeah, but we did.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.840]   There's nothing like freedom to get more people motivated.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.080]   But they're still selling Volkswagen in the next day.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.840]   You're saying our freedoms helped us develop a bomb that killed millions of people.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.200]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.680]   I'm just working this out here.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.680]   But there are freedoms.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.800]   There's an innovation that had to take place there.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.200]   And somebody had to get to it first and the free country did.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   Peter, go ahead.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.440]   I was going to say there are freedoms in certain areas and there are not freedoms in
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.440]   other areas.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.160]   There'd be more sensitive when you're addressing certain kinds of political speech.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.400]   But when it comes to the economy, you pretty much have freedom to develop the kind of businesses
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.400]   you want.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:09.840]   You see a lot of pretty strong entrepreneurial companies.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.240]   They're coming up right now.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.240]   They've done an interesting thing, which is you have to compartmentalize to say, "Okay,
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.560]   we're going to create free economic zones.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:24.120]   We're going to let capitalism operate here in this scope, but not there."
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.120]   That's innovative.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.120]   Semi-democracy, semi-totallitarian.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.360]   It's either innovative or desperate.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.080]   I don't know if desperation, well, you've got a big population.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.520]   You've got a lot of pollution problems, obviously.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.840]   And you've got a lot of other issues.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.840]   But chickens.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   And you've got a lot of chickens.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.480]   Where are they putting the chickens?
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.000]   They could have riots in the street for the next two decades.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.840]   They could have civil wars over there.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.120]   And it is a very difficult nation to govern.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.120]   They have, apparently.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   I've told.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.000]   There's a lot of local autonomy, which is both good and bad.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.200]   That's part of the problem with the earthquake, was that the local authorities there were
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.200]   incompetent.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.040]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.200]   Anyway, I think what we saw in that opening ceremony was clearly a message from the Chinese
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.080]   government to the world that, "Hey, we're here.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.520]   We're numerous.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.560]   And we're not illiterate.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.160]   We're not.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.720]   We've technically very sophisticated.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:24.320]   That 147 meter LED screen was mind boggling."
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.320]   But how does it look on Silverlight?
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.320]   It actually looks good.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   Look here.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.320]   See, this is the Silverlight.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.320]   What about NBC?
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:37.560]   What about NBC kind of doing this deal with Microsoft, going after Adobe saying, "Hey,
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.680]   you've got to download Silverlight.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.080]   You want to watch the Olympics online.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.440]   What about that?
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.960]   Is that an anti-competitive move of exactly the same kind that they got in trouble for,
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.000]   the DOJ that they're still in trouble for with the EU?
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Or is it just good business?
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.280]   Andrew, you're looking at me funny.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   This is a radio show.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   It's a choice.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.120]   You can't give me a look.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   It's a choice.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.680]   I mean, nobody said they'd use the flash.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   The flash is also proprietary.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.680]   Right.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.680]   So if you didn't do that, you'd watch it in flash.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.920]   What are you going to watch in quick time?
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.920]   Right.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.920]   That's not happening.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.920]   You're going to have a choice.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.040]   Now, what Microsoft did was step up to the plate and they're really trying to push this
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.040]   hole.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.040]   It's there.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.640]   I'm looking at the Silverlight on that right now.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   That looks great.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.280]   I mean, they must down sample it depending on the bandwidth.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.440]   That must happen because I went on the bandwidth earlier.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.440]   That looks great.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.560]   But what's really neat is if you can, the sidebar here, there's a little button, couple
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.240]   buttons, you can actually put in your zip code and your phone and your cable provider,
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.120]   let's say, and you could use picture and pictures of it.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.120]   It's really neat.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.120]   Yeah, like that.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.320]   You can also choose what you want to have in the very inside bar.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.320]   That's kind of cool.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.280]   So that's a nice looking, I will tell you, I have some relationships with Microsoft and
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.840]   the Silverlight is a big push for them.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.920]   I said I would ask you, and I'm going to ask you Jason about propeller, first of all,
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.080]   that was kind of the dig clone that you created when you were at AOL.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.880]   And now the stories are that it's kind of, what's going on with propeller?
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:13.200]   From what I understand, they laid off a couple of people and didn't refill a couple of positions.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:17.080]   And you know that AOL, and all I know is what's really publicly out there.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   Well, that's not true.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.080]   I do know some stuff that's not a public.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.080]   People must be calling you there.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.120]   Yeah, the people who work for me always send me everything.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.120]   I feel like crazy.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.840]   So I'm always trying to be honest on the show.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.200]   So I do have some inside information, but in terms of publicly available information,
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:35.400]   AOL is shutting a lot of things down and trimming a lot of time Warner is.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.720]   Time Warner, I mean AOL is one of its loss leaders, but you take the magazines in AOL,
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.160]   those are both sinking time Warner.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.600]   There's a big problem and they're selling it.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.080]   Obviously, they split up the company.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.640]   Buke is set publicly in order to split it.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.320]   So there's an access business and there's an advertising business.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.080]   And when I work there, that process was underway actually and that's public knowledge as well.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.520]   What do you think they're going to do?
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.640]   Do you think they're going to sell one of the pieces or both of the pieces?
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.360]   Well, I think that they could sell from what I've read and what's out there.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.480]   I think they can sell the access business to either a financial company like a private
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.240]   equity company or to Earthlink and people like that.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.000]   So that's probably what will happen.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.720]   As an ISP, it's kind of just...
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.160]   Yeah, just give it to another ISP.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:24.680]   Then the traffic from that would still go to AOL.com and then they try to sell AOL and
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:30.800]   all the other things they all like, movie, phone and whatnot, to a Yahoo or Microsoft.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.080]   And you have three or four big assets in there.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:40.240]   You have mail, number one or number two in mail, instant messaging and news and sports
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.240]   and some of those things.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.960]   A lot of the verticals that would fit nicely.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:47.480]   But the truth is, I think a lot of these companies like Yahoo and Microsoft may not be that interested.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:53.520]   If they did, they would have bought it already and it's really gone south in a big way, really
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.480]   quick actually since John will have...
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:00.040]   What's the demographics for the people who use AOL's core AOL dial-up/program?
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.040]   What's the demographic?
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.200]   I think it's about 80 or so.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   80 or so.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.600]   They think AOL is the internet.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.600]   I have to go to AOL.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   I use the internet.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.240]   I turn at the AOL.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.960]   And I think that when I say a dying business, I mean I really believe it's a dying business.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.120]   And as a matter of fact, it's losing money.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:22.160]   They have some of their sights and I agree that they're good.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.720]   I just think that they're way out of the loop.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:30.560]   And I also think that once everybody gets in the light and when they get that Google
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:35.960]   bug, it's something, it's like a disease that takes down companies.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.120]   They just can't recover.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.240]   They just can't think of anything else other than how to beat Google.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.240]   Just get away from it.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.720]   It's just you don't have to be an advertising company.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.440]   Go over and do something else to make money.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.680]   Yeah, there is a little bit of Google and AOL never had it.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.480]   AOL is like, "We're going to do display advertising.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.280]   We're going to create an ad network that's based on display and not search advertising."
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.080]   And they did really well.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.000]   So yeah, it seems like it's a bit of a mess.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.040]   The propeller stuff is not that big of a deal.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.200]   You cut a couple of positions here.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.920]   It's not going to really affect the service.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.280]   And the service is the number two social news site.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.760]   Oh, actually number three now because Yahoo Buzz is number one.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   Dig is number two.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.840]   Yeah, Buzz is just by virtue of the fact that his Yahoo is huge.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.040]   But see, the thing that's frustrating for me is when I was there, I was trying to do
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.480]   what Yahoo Buzz was doing, which is have it integrated into AOL's homepage.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.000]   It would have been as big.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.920]   And I had the same exact idea that made Yahoo Buzz work, which was sell people the chance
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.400]   to be on the AOL homepage, which will send you 400,000 people instead of 40,000, which
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.640]   did consent.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.040]   That gets publishers really interested.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.200]   And publishers are really participating in Yahoo Buzz.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.280]   That's why Yahoo Buzz is actually beating Dig in terms of traffic from what I understand.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.280]   I think that's out there.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   Oh, it's huge.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.280]   I think it's significant.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:49.000]   Yeah, and so if that's the case, Yahoo was able to create Dig and not buy it, right?
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.640]   And Yahoo had been an early suitor for Dig.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.640]   I created a propeller at Netscape and they were able, they're actually now starting to
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.760]   follow the Buzz thing, which was my original idea.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.720]   So they're going to be able to be Dig.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:07.920]   And so that's why I think Dig on the market is maybe not so quickly closing as a sale.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.840]   But with the WebLogs in situation, it's a whole other mess.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.520]   Well, like I said, I wrote for them, they're shutting that down, left it right and taking
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:19.800]   out the payments and really, I think, blogging buyouts is gone and a few other things are
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.960]   cutting down and just scaling back on entirely.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:28.160]   But I think I got the whole low down of what happened.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.480]   They basically got to the end of the month, they realized they overspent for the year.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.240]   And now they, so then they did a bonehead move, which as they said, everybody stopped
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.240]   blogging.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.240]   Right.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.480]   And that just scared the hell out of everybody.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.680]   And this is a mobile workforce, a work from home workforce that I curated and built out
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.680]   with my team.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.440]   For those who don't know that Jason, this was Jason's company, which he sold to AOL.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.600]   Engage it, autoblog, joystick, et cetera.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.320]   And so the worst thing you can do with somebody who's working from home and down the office
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.480]   is just tell them, oh, there's no work for you for the next 10 days, no warning, et cetera.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.080]   And we're talking about 500 blog posts that $10 or $15 a piece.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.760]   It's $5,000 to $10,000.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:11.360]   The average senior vice president, executive vice president over there gets paid $300,000
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.040]   to $700,000 to $700,000, $800,000.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.480]   To take the salt of the earth people and not pay them the $5,000, it's just so bonehead
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.800]   and so unfair.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.720]   And really, to be honest, it's just--
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.640]   Well, is it that they're not going to make payroll?
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   I'm ashamed.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.000]   Can they not make payroll?
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   I mean, what is the deal?
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.280]   No, they can make payroll.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.240]   It's just a bunch of spreadsheet wonks going, you're over budget and then they have to pull
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.240]   back really quick.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.720]   It was not like that.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.520]   The way they presented it, Jason, was horrible.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.000]   It was an email.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   It was quick.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.160]   It was like, thank you very much, but we're not going to be paying for--
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   Right.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.160]   Don't write anything.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.160]   Stop.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.160]   It was just like, what?
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   You know, that was not a great thing.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.000]   Explain what you're doing.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.240]   So it was supposed to be a team effort and all that, but whatever.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.240]   So stupid.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.480]   And I asked them to sell me some of the blogs that they weren't using.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   Really?
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.160]   And they shut down like Card Squad and Divester, which about scuba diving and poker, my two
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.160]   of my passions.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.160]   They won't even give it back to me.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.160]   You know why?
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.160]   You know why.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.000]   How humiliating if you take them, you turn them around, you make them viable.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.080]   You know, whenever you have people work with you, you should forever try to make them
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.120]   feel good about you and want to work with you.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.080]   And with me and the rest of the team, they basically just-- they never really reached
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.080]   out to us or tried to make us feel good.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.400]   You know, and like, they should treat us like alumni, you know?
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.400]   And they don't.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.400]   And that's why people hate AOL, you know?
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.400]   Yeah, it's too bad.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.440]   You should treat your alumni well.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.440]   Google does that.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.440]   Microsoft does that.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.440]   Yahoo does that.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.440]   AOL doesn't do it.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.440]   It's just terrible.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.440]   I'm actually just--
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.240]   Let's change the subject.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.240]   He sounded terrible.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   He sounded awful.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.240]   I'm sorry about that, buddy.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.240]   I'm thinking about the Tesla.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:55.680]   Just piss me off because, you know, I feel a lot of responsibility to sell a company to
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.160]   somebody.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.760]   And I'm responsible in some ways for those people what happens to them.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.240]   And, you know, then to shortchange people, you know, over nothing.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.080]   And they realized it was a bone head move and then they tried the back track.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:11.440]   And then the bloggers, you know, God bless them, are so loyal to the brands.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:18.200]   They're like, they created shadow accounts like Twaw Blogger and, you know, TV Squad Blogger.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.680]   And so they could blog for free.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.280]   And then they put their buy line in the body of the article so it wouldn't get caught up
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.920]   in the, you know, accounting system.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:30.520]   If you know what we can do, Jason, if you want, I have that the web-- the email that goes
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.520]   out to all the blog.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.520]   You want me to, like, offer something from you to them?
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.520]   You know, you could-- I'd offer them both jobs already.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.520]   I'd offer them both.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:39.520]   Did you?
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.520]   You're a good guy, yes.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.520]   Yeah, I knocked-- I knocked the pizza over.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.760]   You know, I tried to buy the ones that were shutting down and reharted the bloggers because
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.640]   I could run it for five grand, you know, each of these blogs.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.640]   It wasn't expensive.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.640]   Jason, it wasn't that expensive.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.480]   I mean, they were paying very small amount of money for each post.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.480]   That bucks.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.480]   That bucks, 15 bucks a post.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   Exactly.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.480]   I mean, it's up with the knowledge.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.480]   Anyway, you know what?
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.880]   Big companies, when they're in trouble, they start, you know, flailing around.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.880]   They flailing.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.640]   And then people get knocked over.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   And it's usually the little guy who gets knocked over.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.480]   Trust me, no executive vice president over there is missing a paycheck, you know?
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.480]   Right.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.880]   Yes, you should-- you should-- you should make it like, you know.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.120]   Stop managing for the rest of the month.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.240]   We will not be paying you for any managing you do for the rest of the month.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.240]   So please--
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   Unless you choose to--
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.440]   Oh, no, no, no flights on the private G5.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   Yeah, you think that's happened?
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:31.080]   You know, one tank of gas on the G5 would pay for all those bloggers.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.880]   No, one third of an hour.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.000]   It's cost about 15 grand to run a G5 an hour.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.520]   You see, there's a really good example.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.440]   That's a different-- no, that's a different accounting unit.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   There's a different spreadsheet.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.440]   You can't cross that.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.280]   Let's go on across the board on all of this.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.680]   I mean, the fact is that, you know, we're probably in the worst--
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:56.560]   Jason and Peter, we're in the worst time for this dislocation of the average Joe to management
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.200]   and corporate America than I've ever seen.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.080]   And I've been in this business 25 years.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.440]   And it's pretty bad, don't you think?
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.000]   I mean, the balance of power between the executives and the--
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   Or the financial service.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   What is it?
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   What is it?
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   What is it?
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   It's the balance of power.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.840]   You know, as I call it, the milli-vanilly world, you know, they kind of talk and it's not
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:16.280]   coming out the way they supposedly say in it.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:21.480]   And you know, it's just that the lying and the manipulation and this, you know, it seems
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:25.960]   that they keep getting paid, but everybody else gets screwed along the way.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.120]   Who's going to buy AOL?
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.880]   What's going to happen to AOL, do you think, Jason?
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.360]   I don't know.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.680]   I mean, I just-- the asset is going down in value so quickly.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:41.640]   I don't-- they'll sell the ISP to Ariflank, you know, or one of the other ones, Netzira
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.640]   or whatever.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   Right.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.840]   And the content stuff probably gets sold off.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.840]   Peace, Neil.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.840]   It's a disaster.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:48.840]   It's a disaster.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.840]   It's a disaster.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.840]   They had a good strategy to grow.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.560]   You have to invest if you want to grow.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.560]   And everybody in the space is investing.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.920]   Yahoo, Microsoft, even ask.com, News Call Up.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:03.840]   Everybody's putting money to these things and all AOL is done is cut, cut, cut.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.440]   You're not going to build something innovative when you have VCs investing in startups and
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.440]   all the incumbents investing in buying startups and building new products.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.080]   You have to invest for growth.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.440]   You cannot grow by cutting.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.440]   Right.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.880]   So I just got an email from Barack Obama.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:24.320]   He says, this is-- this is-- here's a guy who has definitely understood the web and used
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.320]   it well.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.320]   He's on Twitter.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.720]   He's a number two guy on Twitter.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.200]   Right after Kevin Rose.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.400]   He's-- he's--
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.400]   He's--
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   He's got a proper--
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.400]   He's used the internet very well.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:38.440]   He says, "I am about to announce my vice president sometime before the convention, which
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.200]   is next week, right?
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:44.520]   And if you sign up, I will email you or text message you the announcement before I send
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.520]   it out to the press."
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.520]   What do you think?
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.520]   What--
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:52.960]   What a clever way to get email addresses, cell phone numbers, bad way to piss off the
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:53.960]   press.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.760]   Well, I can tell you, the press is probably doing what I just did, which is I signed up
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   immediately.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.760]   Right.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.760]   What-- so, yes, exactly.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.760]   So who's--
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.760]   So it doesn't really matter, does it?
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.560]   But it sure looks good from the point of view of the people, right?
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.560]   And especially the Dejirotte.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.040]   Oh, it can be started.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.040]   What?
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   It's called a game.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.040]   It's a game.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.040]   It's called politics.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.520]   Yeah, but it's the whole way.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.520]   It's been structured.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:19.160]   It's just that this whole thing has been so just it's been just--
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.160]   Hey, hey.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.160]   Sound like a--
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.160]   Let me ask you something.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.640]   I'm going to finance saying, "Who believes that if he comes in, we're going to have
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.320]   a really good economic situation in front of us?"
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.320]   I mean, come on.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.320]   He has no plan.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.320]   I'm not saying the other guy--
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.000]   It's not clear that either candidate is that strong.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   I totally agree.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   It's also not clear that--
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.920]   Do you think anybody could do anything?
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.080]   I mean, is there somebody who-- what magic person is going to come in and fix everything?
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.080]   Bloomberg.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.920]   Hey, Bloomberg could probably do it.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.920]   He didn't run, though.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.920]   Ice President.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.920]   Ah, interesting.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:56.560]   He's pretty-- he said many times you really want to know part of that.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.560]   Yeah, he's not the kind of guy who wants to be vice president, right?
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.560]   Right.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.200]   He wants to keep it going in New York and keep things going.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.200]   I don't know.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:09.520]   Listen, Bush didn't do any good either, right?
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:10.520]   But it doesn't seem like--
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.520]   Oh, isn't he good?
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.320]   Is it on a fiscal basis?
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   Is it a disaster?
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.320]   Disaster.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.320]   Yep.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.240]   Does that-- I mean, worse than any Democrat in terms of fiscal responsibility, like ever?
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.440]   Worse than any three Democrats ever.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.440]   True.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   Exactly.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   Actually, you're probably correct.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:31.600]   If you took the financial situation and the amount of, like, from surplus to debt, I
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.360]   mean, even if you did it in real-- as opposed to real dollars doing it in, like, time adjusted
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   dollars.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.360]   No, the numbers are--
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.360]   And probably would be--
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.360]   Probably would be the worst, yeah.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.360]   And the numbers are just-- I mean, you know, and just keeps on spending and spending and
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.360]   spending.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.360]   And one of these days-- not to get too deep into this-- we do that on the podcast.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.840]   We get into this whole thing and my rants and my craziness.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:55.720]   But there is just way too much money going everywhere but here.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.280]   I don't know where they're coming up with it and if you say, oh, well, they printed.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.800]   But you know, that's the whole point of our dollar.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.800]   Why?
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   Because it's a bad shape.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.640]   It's that we've spent recklessly and these bailing out these companies.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.000]   I mean, it talked about GM, oh, GM.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.480]   And they're having problems.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.960]   Oh, don't worry, GM can't go bad.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:10.960]   They'll be bailed out.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.440]   I mean, when's it end?
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.440]   When's it end?
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.440]   Moving along.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:18.080]   I don't want to get too much into politics because all of our geeks hate that when we
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.080]   do.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.600]   Big story in the business week.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   Very interesting story.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:27.840]   Insiders at Facebook selling stock at prices well below the valuation.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.040]   People were once claiming for it.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.240]   Microsoft when they bought that little equity stake in October, what that made it about,
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.080]   a $15 billion valuation.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.240]   They're not getting that.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.240]   What's the story there, Peter?
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.240]   Well, yeah.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:43.000]   One of our reporters dug into this reporter by the name of Spencer Ante and he found out
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.200]   that there are a number of people who are selling stock including Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:53.520]   He names another guy, Kohler, who's also selling.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.920]   And he looks at the valuations that they're getting for their shares.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.880]   And it's not encouraging.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:06.000]   I think the value ranges from about just under $4 billion up to $6 billion for their stock.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.840]   Now, if it hadn't been for the $15 billion phony valuation, would that be so very bad,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:13.840]   $3 or $4 billion?
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.080]   It's a very good question.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.480]   Oh, it certainly wouldn't be that bad.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   No.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   I mean, they'd be very proud if they could.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.480]   Fantastic.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   Come on.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   That's a few Teslas.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.720]   Yeah, what's the PDE on that?
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.680]   I mean, that's pretty good.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.680]   It's not bad.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.480]   $300 million in revenue.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.720]   It'd be 10 times their revenue number.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.640]   Their earnings are probably 50 million.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.440]   So that would be 60 times.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.440]   60, 80 times.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.440]   That's good.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.440]   That's a good one.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.440]   So another is 15 is insane.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.440]   So the question that we have.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.440]   The question that we have.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.440]   You raised a good question.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:43.440]   Is it $15 billion?
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.360]   Is that a phony valuation or an underphone evaluation?
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.960]   Microsoft and Facebook put out the press release saying that it valued the company at
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:50.960]   $15 million.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.360]   It's not like that was made up.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.360]   Wow.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.920]   That doesn't just the fact that Microsoft bought this little bit and that multiply at times
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:57.920]   the total amount.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:03.520]   There's a very important caveat here, which is preferred shares versus common shares.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.360]   But is it Facebook here today?
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.360]   That's an important distinction.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:12.000]   I mean, the shares that Microsoft got are preferred shares and they have certain rights
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.200]   associated with them, including liquidity rights, so that if the company gets sold,
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.440]   they get paid off first before anybody else at the company.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.960]   So that certainly makes them more valuable than the common shares that people are selling.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.520]   How much stock are the insiders dumping?
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.680]   Is it a significant amount?
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.160]   We don't have 100% figures on that.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.160]   1% Jason?
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:34.960]   Well, I saw somebody back into an estimate.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.200]   Usually the employee stock option pool is 15%.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:43.400]   And so if people were selling 50 million, 100 million shares, you could back out of it
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:46.160]   into maybe 1 or 2% of the company maximum.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.420]   And that's basically what happens now in C rounds and D rounds in order to keep the
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.920]   entrepreneurs and the management team at the company.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:57.960]   Because there's no liquidity events are getting pushed out and there's no public offering,
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.120]   and no liquidity in the stock, they're basically saying, in your B round, your C round will
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.120]   give you some money.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.480]   I mean, Kevin Rhodes, I think, took a million dollars off the table in his second round.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.040]   That's why he can buy cars and not--
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.040]   Well, Facebook--
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.040]   He's still running dig, right?
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.040]   Right.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:15.880]   Facebook in response has instituted this program where employees can sell some of their stock.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.680]   And I think the upper limit on that is 20% of their shares.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.820]   So you're giving them a chance to get some money and get out.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.220]   It's obviously controversial with the VCs.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.740]   They're not crazy about making people rich before they get a liquidity.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.780]   Well, and according to Spencer, there's also a requirement that they not value it, that
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.300]   stock not sell it more than 3.7 billion value.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.060]   Yeah, that's very curious.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.380]   And there could be a couple of reasons for that.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:46.460]   One, Facebook has told the IRS that the company is worth 3.75 billion dollars according to
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.220]   their IRS calculation.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:53.040]   So if they have a bunch of people sell at prices higher than that, then they have to
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.120]   revalue the company, can create tax events for certain people.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.160]   Also, it may just be to try to persuade people not to sell their stock.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.720]   But I still question, is Facebook-- why does Facebook necessarily have to be here?
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720]   I mean, it's back to the advertising.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.840]   Again, that's the whole where they get all their money or chunk of their money.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.840]   And do we necessarily think that Facebook has to stay forever?
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.080]   I mean, I know now, and it's been popular.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.080]   I can't go there.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:24.420]   I mean, the spammers that are just constantly writing junk, and I have to go here, I have
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.420]   to go there.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:31.260]   I mean, it's just kind of become less intimate.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:35.500]   Eric Capost says there's an issue too with allowing these guys to take this money out.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.440]   He says, you've got to ask, are you facilitating people leaving the company to start their
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440]   own businesses?
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.740]   Are you just giving them the seed capital to say, okay, I'm going to start the next
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:44.740]   Facebook?
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.740]   Yeah, it is controversial.
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.840]   After we did the story, I got a chance to talk to a friend of mine who does these kinds
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840]   of investments.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:54.940]   And he was saying that from their standpoint, they hate seeing employees cash out, one,
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.780]   because they haven't had the chance to cash out yet.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.240]   And two, you give people a little bit of dough.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.740]   Maybe they're not working quite as hard as they've been before.
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:06.700]   He said it's one thing if they need a house, if they need a place to put their family or
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:09.300]   a decent salary, but they don't want them getting rich.
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.100]   So you think Kevin took a million out of dig in that third round?
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.100]   I heard that.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.100]   I don't want to make too much speculation.
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.700]   But when they did the last round, I think he was able to take a little off the table.
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.700]   Good.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:18.700]   I'm glad you heard that.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.700]   I heard that.
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:20.700]   I heard that.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:21.700]   Multiple people.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:22.700]   Who knows is it true or not?
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:23.700]   But you can ask him.
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.700]   Hey, I really shouldn't have said, given that opportunity, I'd do that.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.700]   Why not?
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.700]   Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said that.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:27.700]   Sorry, Kevin.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.700]   And I don't know that.
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:29.700]   It's true.
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.700]   I've never heard it from him.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.700]   I just heard it from two or three people around him.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:32.700]   But I think...
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.500]   Well, he can afford that sofa now that he's been wanting.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.300]   Listen, it's very good for...
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.500]   Really good for a young entrepreneur.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.140]   There's different people have different situations.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:44.540]   If you haven't had your first hit and you're sitting there in a studio bedroom, you're
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:49.100]   going to want to get out and you're going to want to get somebody.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.740]   In that case, it's good for the VC to let them take $9.00 off the table.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:56.060]   It's not so much that they're going to say, "Okay, I'm going to give up," especially
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:59.100]   if they think there's some real value in what they're building.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.260]   But it's enough so that they don't say, "What am I doing this for?
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.700]   Am I wasting my time?"
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:08.900]   It's enough so when they're doing the five years, six years, seven years marathon sprint,
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.780]   there's your business sprinting the whole time.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:14.820]   It's marathon and duration sprint in terms of pace.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.820]   You at least have your apartment.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:19.060]   If they can go south and you swing them for the fence, at least when it ends, you have
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.060]   your apartment or your house.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.060]   You're getting paid?
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.060]   They get a salary.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.060]   They get a salary.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.060]   They get paid.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.820]   They sell it, but you sell a couple of shares.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:29.660]   It's very common for people to do this.
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:30.660]   It's a good idea.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.100]   When it's not a good idea, if you have somebody who already has sold something and you're
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.100]   like, "They want to sell?"
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.100]   It's like, "Wait a second.
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.100]   You've got money in the bank.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.100]   You don't need the money."
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.100]   You've got to take another two or three million off the table.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.100]   That's something to worry about.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.100]   That's something to worry about.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.500]   A lot of VCs were upset about this.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:49.420]   Founders Fund, which is Peter Thiel, the guy who started PayPal's company, Founders Fund,
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:54.180]   which is their specializing in this.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.980]   Their shtick to entrepreneurs is when we do the next round, we give each of the people
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.180]   a quarter million dollars, half million dollars on the management team, and take a little
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.180]   off the table.
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.220]   We're going to take a little break.
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:13.060]   When we come back, I want to mention an article in USA Today that says, "Kids today are downloading
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:19.900]   and getting addicted to digital drugs, binoral music that makes them high."
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:20.900]   Is it the new addiction?
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.540]   Or is USA Today just trying to sell newspapers?
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:26.140]   What's the website?
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.540]   Where can I get some?
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.540]   Andrew Horace says, "I want some of that."
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:30.540]   No, I think we should.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:36.140]   In fact, while I talk about this, Audible, maybe you guys want to go out and download
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.180]   some binoral beats, some digital drugs, get high and let me know.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.180]   Would you get back to me?
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.180]   I'll be back.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.180]   All right.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.420]   Meanwhile, dude, dude, pass the bits.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:49.060]   This is the stupidest article I have ever read.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.620]   I can't wait to talk about it.
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:57.100]   Meanwhile, I would like to mention this show is brought to you by the good folks at Audible.com/twit.
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:59.740]   That's where you can go to get yourself a free book.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.180]   Ah, some Audible.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.180]   This is the digital inaugural.
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.180]   This is the drug.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.460]   This is the drug for Jason.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:07.460]   He loves these books.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.980]   What do you listen to these days, Jason?
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.220]   What's your latest Audible book?
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:13.340]   I tell you what I'm listening to for the second time.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.300]   Good to great because I gave it to my team.
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.580]   That's a good book.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:20.380]   It is the best business book I've ever written.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:23.580]   I bought a couple copies of this for people.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.580]   Audible.
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.580]   You can burn see these.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.580]   It was very nice.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.580]   Hand them to your people.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.260]   They listen, I bought like three copies.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.900]   This is something you can do for your business today.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:33.900]   People go on retreats.
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:37.060]   They spend thousands of dollars and stuff like that where people go have a dinner with their
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.900]   company, thousands of dollars.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.340]   It's gone once you spend it.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.540]   Here you go buy yourself five copies of a great business book on audio.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.980]   You hand it to people.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.100]   You say put it in your car and listen to it.
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.900]   Put it on your computer right now and listen to it.
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.220]   This is something that I think all companies should do.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:57.460]   I'm actually thinking about creating a little Audible sort of budget for my management team.
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.660]   Let them spend a hundred bucks a year on some of this book.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.180]   There's a lot of business material on there.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.180]   It's just great.
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.180]   It's a really great thing to do.
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.540]   Audible makes it simple and easy.
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.700]   Who's reading good to great?
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.500]   Is he reading it?
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.900]   I'm listening to it again for the second time.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.700]   I'm just wondering who the reader is if it's the author.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.700]   It's funny.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.900]   My wife read this book.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.940]   He said, well she's called me Leo.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.500]   She says, honey buns.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.220]   Or she calls me Leo.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:24.820]   It depends on her mood.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:25.820]   You should read this.
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.820]   I was blown away.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:29.700]   I don't know where she found out about it.
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:30.700]   It's great.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:35.580]   My brother-in-law who's a dean at Major University, he read it and he said, this is great even
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.660]   for us.
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:43.660]   It's really about how taking any organization and making a great organization.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:48.780]   The author does case studies on some of the best organizations who've taken a good business
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.340]   and made it a really great business.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.740]   I can't remember what the businesses are in there.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:58.300]   I forgot the names of the businesses in there.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.780]   It's basically-
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.780]   Is it FedEx?
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:01.780]   One of them?
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:02.780]   I can't remember.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.740]   Basically what they did was they basically did a study where they looked for companies
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:14.260]   that did average, then grew much higher percentage compared to the market and stayed up as opposed
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.380]   to people who grew and then came back down.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:19.060]   They looked at that and they said, well how did this happen?
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.060]   There's other things-
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.060]   So it was a true transformation.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.540]   It wasn't just the market improved or whatever.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.300]   There's so many good business books in there.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.300]   I'm going to have to look.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.500]   Yeah, I think that's a great recommendation.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.740]   One of the great books for investors, of course, is our own friend Andrew Horitz, who
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.580]   are which is the discipline investor.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.580]   Did you read that?
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.580]   I read it.
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:38.700]   They asked me to read it because I had the podcast and they said, you know, people want
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:39.700]   to hear your voice.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.860]   I'm so sure I could do that.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   Have you ever done it?
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:42.860]   Hard work.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:43.860]   I did a children's story.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:44.860]   It was about three-
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.860]   It's grueling.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:46.860]   It's grueling.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:50.460]   I was sitting in a box for like a week and a half and you have them constantly- Do that
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.460]   again.
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.460]   Oh, I don't want to do that again.
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.460]   Come on.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.300]   It's pretty grueling, but it came out good.
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:00.180]   I think it's- I've got a lot of good commentary about it and it's a good teaching about the
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.180]   world of investment.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.900]   So there's a couple of great books for you that discipline investor by Andrew Horitz on
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.900]   audible.com.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.860]   Good to great by Jim Collins.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:11.700]   Let me tell you, if you want a free book, go there, audible.com/twit, not just business
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:14.220]   fiction, nonfiction history.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:19.700]   I love your lot of history because I love the history, but even things like radio shows,
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.700]   great dramas.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:26.260]   It's a fantastic source of wonderful audio entertainment and I just love it.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.340]   50,000 titles, audible.com/twit.
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.340]   You do audible.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:34.340]   I don't know if I mentioned it before to you, but since we started this show with the Nazi
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.340]   discussion, I thought I'd bring this up.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:41.180]   Jason Peter, did you ever read IBM and the Holocaust?
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.180]   Did you ever hear that book?
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.180]   I heard the book.
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.740]   Yeah, I didn't read it about the world of day.
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:46.740]   Really?
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:47.740]   Fascinating.
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:48.740]   Fascinating.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:53.860]   The thesis of the book is that, and the premise is that without IBM, it would have never happened
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:57.060]   this level a few years before with all the punch cards back then.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:01.100]   They were able to automate the, you know, we always hear the news, how do they know where
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.100]   we were?
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.260]   Well, there was a census done a few years back by IBM and they did it behind the scenes
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:12.980]   in this whole amazing story about Watson and how the CEO at the time of IBM and how they
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:16.020]   pretty much automated the slaughter of the Jews through the Holocaust.
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.220]   Very fascinating story.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:22.500]   There's an interesting example of how technology into talentarianism can go hand in hand.
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.140]   I'd really recommend this.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.140]   It's unbelievable.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.660]   That's by Edwin Black.
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:28.660]   Very interesting.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:29.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.420]   You know what book I'm reading right now, it's just a great book to read is a sense of
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:33.420]   where you are.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.420]   I don't know that.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.420]   What's that?
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.420]   It's about Bill Bradley.
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.100]   And he was like, you know, in college at Yale, it's just incredible.
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.100]   I don't know.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.860]   I don't think it's available on the audio audible yet.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:43.860]   Yet.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.660]   There's a request for audible.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.540]   He was a Princeton not Yale.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.700]   Princeton right now.
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:49.700]   Excuse me.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:56.900]   As a Yale man, I have to say that while we would have loved to have Mr. Bradley on our
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.340]   team, in fact,
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.540]   Mr. Bradley services would have been fantastic.
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:01.540]   Yes.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.540]   He was a tiger, not a bulldog.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.540]   Let's get this straight.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.900]   He did an obvious mistake.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.380]   Does it go on past his college years?
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.380]   Does it go to his?
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.340]   I'm only halfway through, but I think it's just his college years.
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.340]   Fascinating fella.
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:18.940]   That next to him at dinner at an Allen and Company retreat and got to spend time with
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:20.660]   them, had lunch with them another time.
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.860]   It's just all I guarantee it doesn't because it was published in 1965.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.860]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.540]   I don't even know if it's a print anymore, but I mean, that's what they need to do is
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.340]   because, you know, they audible has narrators.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.700]   When you go to audible and you go to the left hand column, they have, you can browse
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.620]   by the narrator.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:39.580]   So if you find a narrator who, I mean, I know this sounds corny, but this is when you start
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.180]   to get into audiobooks.
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:44.620]   Like I love the narrator from Shadow Divers.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.620]   Was that the one we talked about?
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.620]   Isn't that great?
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.260]   That narrator from Shadow Divers is amazing.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.260]   You know, this is an error.
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:51.620]   There's no way that came out in '65.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.900]   He was at Princeton then, I think.
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:54.900]   This came out later.
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.900]   I think we exceeded the three of them.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.940]   They voted for the New York for Red Run that time.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:10:59.940]   Really?
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:00.940]   Yes, John McPhee.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.940]   I love his stuff, by the way.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:02.940]   Yeah, he's fantastic.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:03.940]   What a great writer.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.940]   Good.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.180]   Thank you for the recommendation.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.220]   It's not part of an audible commercial, but it's just a recommendation.
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.220]   I don't mind that.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.780]   I love that.
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:13.900]   So I had a story I was going to mention.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:14.900]   I forgot.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.900]   What did I tease?
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.900]   We were getting stoned on the computer or something like that.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.900]   Oh, yes.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.020]   So this is a USA today.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:25.300]   There's a category of journalism, particularly in the tech journalism.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.460]   It's kind of the scare tactic.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:33.900]   Your kids right now are talking to petarasts on Facebook or, you know.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:34.900]   Cyber porn.
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:35.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:36.900]   You know.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.900]   Cyber porn.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.460]   Cyber porn.
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.060]   Did you know that a new app for the iPhone?
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.700]   I think it was an iPhone app for that.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.700]   $999.
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.700]   Oh, we got to talk about it.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:46.700]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:47.700]   I love to talk about it.
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:48.700]   All right, let's talk about that.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.380]   It's called I Am Rich.
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:52.380]   And eight people bought it.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.580]   I'm thinking, Jason, you got to be one of them.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.580]   Well, I took seven of the eight.
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:57.580]   I'm so rich.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.420]   I bought it for my whole team.
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:00.940]   Yeah, I got to throw everybody.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:01.940]   Talk about a stupid app.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:04.060]   There's a couple of questions here that come to mind.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.500]   First of all, this app, it's called I Am Rich.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:07.980]   It's the most expensive app.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.580]   iTunes doesn't go above a thousand bucks.
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:13.060]   It's $1,000 applicator or $999.99, whatever.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:16.060]   So the guy obviously spun the dial until it went to the very top and wouldn't go any
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.060]   higher.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.500]   It's all it does is a little ruby.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.500]   It says I am rich.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.540]   You know, it's on your iPhone desktop.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.540]   You press it.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:23.540]   Big ruby comes up.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.540]   It's got some mantra.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:29.340]   If you press information and says I am rich and I deserve it and I'm healthy and my life
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.340]   is good.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.340]   I love myself.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.900]   I love my wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.420]   And that's it.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:40.580]   The point I guess is if you're so rich, you could just buy this and not think about it.
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:43.220]   It's kind of like the license plate vanity where you have the number one.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.220]   And that means whatever it means.
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.900]   It's like a black American Express card basically.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.780]   So Apple has to allow these apps.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.500]   That's my question into the store.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.500]   How they like that?
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.660]   Eight people buy it.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.860]   First of all, you got to wonder who these nuts are.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.860]   At least two of these said I was on a mistake.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.060]   It could have been the company itself.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.060]   Good point.
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:01.500]   Oh, but Apple does take a third so they cost some of us.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.500]   That's a lot.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.500]   So yeah, it's promotion.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.380]   Then Apple, so Apple proves it.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:09.460]   And I've got to point out that I've talked to a number of developers who have very interesting.
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:13.660]   There's an application, for instance, for managing your Netflix queue and your blockbuster
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:14.660]   queue.
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.300]   This guy's been sitting on this application.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:17.740]   Apple will not approve it.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.740]   There's a lot.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.260]   There's some games out there that people want to see.
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:22.160]   Apple will not approve it.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.780]   Apple approves this nitwit application.
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.220]   And then three days later pulls it.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.260]   My question is why do they approve it in the first place?
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:32.620]   And even more importantly, if they're going to approve it, what right do they have to
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.620]   the pullet?
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:34.620]   Was it illegal?
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:36.620]   Well, the question, who approved it?
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:41.100]   Yeah, well, until they just have discretion to pull off anything that they want to because
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.900]   it's embarrassing.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:44.900]   Embarrassing to Apple?
[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.860]   Actually, Voice of IP was pulled.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860]   I actually--
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:50.900]   The Voice of IP wasn't there Voice of IP?
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:54.380]   Well, and there was another-- no river had one that allowed you to use your iPhone as
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:55.380]   a tethered motor.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.540]   The motor, yeah.
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.540]   Which--
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.020]   Apple pulled for legitimate reason, their contract with AT&T prohibits that.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:03.100]   Well, that's one of the granddiler, which is they say if you can kind of get around
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.980]   and use the touch to make calls.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:05.980]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:06.980]   That's the grand central.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.620]   The grand central.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.660]   They've also blocked the GPS turn by turn navigation, right?
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:15.140]   By contract, the developers are not allowed to do such a thing.
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:16.140]   Right.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:21.100]   Now the question is-- Steve Jobs actually approved-- he approves each application from
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.100]   what I understand.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.100]   No.
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.100]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:25.100]   It all has to be approved by Steve Jobs.
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.100]   He plays each one.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.300]   This is a real problem at Apple.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.780]   Talk about a bottleneck.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:30.780]   That can't be the case.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:32.100]   He doesn't have to call it.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:38.220]   Now I'm told he approves the manufacturer of the T-shirts in the Apple store.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.220]   He approves.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.460]   This is a true story.
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:45.020]   When I had my magazine, Silken and our reporter back in the day, we tried to get the ad agency
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:49.140]   or whatever to-- and we had other advertisers from them to put Apple ads in.
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.580]   And we kept talking to them and it's like year three we're talking to them about Apple
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.660]   ads and they're like, listen, Jason, I can tell you something but it's totally over the
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.500]   record, blah, blah, blah.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.740]   And the statute of limitations up now.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:00.740]   Yes, you can say that.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:06.020]   Steve Jobs picks the magazines that Apple advertises in.
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.340]   He wants it in-- Ooh, a reader.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:08.340]   He wants it in Wired.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.740]   He wants it in this one.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.740]   He--
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:11.740]   Mother Jones.
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.740]   He literally picks what magazine they put their ads in.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:14.740]   Crunchy granola review.
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.340]   He was told to be by his ad agency.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.220]   I don't know if this is still the case now.
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.220]   But--
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.220]   Of course he does.
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:24.660]   He's this man is-- talk about micromanaging and this is both the-- obviously the strength
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:25.660]   and the weakness of it.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:26.660]   Well, that's a big weakness.
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.500]   That's a huge weakness.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:34.380]   I mean, if that really is true, then the shareholders have an absolute right to be very upset if
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:35.900]   there is any health conditions with him.
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:40.940]   And the fact is if that is true these days compared to where it was, I think that there
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:46.340]   really needs to be some kind of chain of command movement and a long term or short term
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:51.060]   fixed to this because that's just not a good thing to have one person in charge.
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.060]   We know that.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.060]   I mean, everybody knows.
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.060]   Obviously.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.780]   Well, I have a different approach with the-- in terms of his health.
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:59.580]   I thought that what-- who is the guy who does fake Steve Jobs?
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:00.580]   Dan Loynes or whatever?
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.580]   Dan Lyons, yeah.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:02.580]   He stopped doing that, by the way.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.580]   He said he missed--
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:04.580]   He's a bit of an idiot.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:06.580]   Is he really?
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:07.580]   You know him?
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:08.580]   Not the impersonal.
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.580]   He's a bit of an idiot.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:10.580]   I mean--
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.580]   He's very fun.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.700]   He's basically-- he's like-- he's like 60 years old and he acts like all linkbaider,
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:14.700]   you know, like--
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:15.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.420]   --so it's basically-- you have this like season journalist acting like, you know, Owen Thomas
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.420]   from Valley Way.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.260]   And you know, he-- so it's just-- it's like he doesn't blog age appropriate, you know,
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.260]   like people don't--
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:25.260]   Right.
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:26.260]   Right.
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.540]   He basically like goes on this, you know, whole jihad against Steve Jobs and it's like,
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.380]   you know what?
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:37.780]   If you give-- if you make every CEO disclose all of their health information, nobody's
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.780]   going to want to be CEO.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.780]   Right.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.420]   Just like nobody wants to be president of the United States.
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:46.580]   So for all you investors out there, you have to give some leeway to your CEOs or else--
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.580]   they're not going to do the job.
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.780]   No, but there's a difference between giving leeway to your CEO and your CEO running the
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:57.060]   company single-handedly that everything that happens has to pass by their desk and that
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.060]   there's a difference.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.060]   Well, they don't go together.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.060]   Right.
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.060]   They don't go together.
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:04.780]   Well, as your management style is micromanaging, that's okay as long as you have results.
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:09.540]   I'm not saying I agree with it, but if you have results and then you as an investor know,
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:13.500]   number one, Steve Jobs has had cancer, that's all you need to know.
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.540]   Steve Jobs is of a certain age and he's a micromanager.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.220]   If you don't like those risk factors--
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.220]   Don't buy the stock.
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:21.740]   --that don't buy the frickin' stock and don't be a crybaby that you need to know he
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:26.860]   has health and every six months you got to get a thing and he's under some obligation
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:27.860]   to give it to you.
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:29.140]   There's no obligation here.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:31.100]   His stock is tradable or not.
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.300]   You're free to trade it or not.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.860]   And if you don't like his management style, tough sugar.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.860]   Tough?
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:36.860]   No, you can't say that either.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:37.860]   Tough?
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:39.860]   Yes.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.860]   Thank you.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:41.860]   I didn't mean to say that, but I mean, that's another thing I'm pissed off about.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:46.140]   It's always people like this such an entitlement that Steve Jobs' personal life is everybody's
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.140]   business.
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.140]   It's not.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.140]   No, no, it's not.
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.140]   I agree with you.
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.140]   It's totally not anybody.
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:52.140]   It's not a business.
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.140]   I'm talking about a different situation.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.980]   I'm saying that just as a suggestion to a company that I'm a shareholder and it'd probably
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:01.100]   be a good idea to have a spread of the management if that is being such an incredibly--
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.500]   Well, they have made a good case that they've got one who has David Cook.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.820]   They have good people in the number two, number three positions.
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:12.940]   They're not-- it's-- maybe it's not-- you wouldn't know because Steve's doing everything.
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:18.380]   But presumably, the board is there making it-- oh, no, I don't know.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.620]   The board is probably a little bit into the captive board.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:21.620]   Do they have beard poppers?
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:22.620]   No, they don't.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:27.020]   And by the way, we want to thank beard poppers for providing the cream puss for Dave's bride.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.260]   Aw, my beard popper.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:33.820]   You know, if Jason listens to an audible book and eats beard poppers, I got to tell you
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:34.820]   something.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:35.820]   You never move against it.
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:36.820]   Oh, my Visa card.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:37.820]   No, really.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:41.420]   I just want to talk to them about my Visa card.
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.420]   It's everywhere.
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:44.900]   No, that's some other card.
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:47.020]   Hey, did they have beard poppers in LA or is--
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.020]   They do.
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.740]   And there's a line outside and it's delicious.
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.500]   Did you get the coffee flavor, green tea?
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.500]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.820]   Oh, no, he only brought chocolate and the plain.
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:55.820]   Oh, don't about it back.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:57.740]   Does it have a third special flavor?
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.740]   These are fine.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.900]   I'm not complaining.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:01.540]   This is the next Krispy Kreme.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.940]   Have you had these-- are they only California?
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:06.700]   No, I don't know what they are.
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:09.380]   Beard poppers, fresh and natural cream puffs.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:12.580]   Basically, they come in a dozen like a donut box.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.980]   I thought you brought a donut box in.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.460]   Well, I think they only sell them usually in one.
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.460]   I said, load them up.
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:18.460]   Load them up.
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.460]   There's a price in this station.
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:21.460]   There's only two of us.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:22.460]   How many cream puffs are you?
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.460]   I didn't know.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:24.460]   I thought we were sharing with the audience.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:25.460]   I had no idea.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.460]   Here's how they do it.
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.700]   When you go to the store, they have the maid already.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.900]   It's a Japanese thing, I believe.
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:34.860]   And they take the puff and then they have a big pump and they put the cream in right
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:35.860]   on the spot.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.820]   So the cream, it's not like a soggy thing.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.460]   It's crunchy and delicious.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.460]   It is Japanese.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:42.460]   I didn't--
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.460]   They actually do have those in New York, by the way.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.460]   They have them on the Upper West Side.
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.460]   I think they have one or two stores.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.460]   They're fantastic.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.460]   Well, I saw them.
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:53.700]   I was staying in a hotel and I passed by and said, I'm going to have to bring some of
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.700]   those.
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:55.700]   Well, I'm glad you did.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.700]   You want to listen to a little beer pop?
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:58.700]   I'm saying something.
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.540]   I'm saying down on the side of Japan.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.340]   It started in downtown Osaka.
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:05.300]   Everyone that lived nearby knew about it.
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.580]   Everyone loved the delightful sweet.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:10.060]   And the town was always filled with the pleasant aroma.
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.780]   Not the best audio on the beer pop is website, but they can make it.
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:14.780]   I think they need to get the guy from Shadow Divers.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:18.540]   It sounds like the guy recorded it.
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:19.540]   In a cream puff.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:22.740]   But anyway, that's-- so these are from Japan.
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:23.740]   He looks like a cream puff.
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.740]   Look at the cream puff.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:25.740]   He looks like cream puff.
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.740]   He looks like the cream puff.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.740]   He loved the cream puff.
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:29.740]   Cream puff.
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:30.740]   Cream puff.
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.740]   How many are you supposed to eat?
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.540]   How many are you supposed to eat?
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:38.620]   I don't think there is any therapeutic dose of the beard pop of cream puff.
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:40.420]   Serving size is six.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:46.420]   But look at him.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:50.420]   He looks like the Gortens of Gloucester fisherman.
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:53.420]   He doesn't look like a cream puff guy.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:55.420]   What's fresh natural here?
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:58.420]   So you're saying they've already made the dough.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.420]   They put the cream in.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:00.420]   They have a little pump.
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.420]   I think I'm going to need a little pump to get out of here.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.420]   I think we lost half the audience.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   The other half is probably-- I don't have the beard pop.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.420]   I know who I admit is a competitor of mine.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:14.420]   She does her syndicated national radio show on technology.
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:18.420]   But that's not what offends me about this USA Today article.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.420]   What offends me is without any evidence at all.
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:22.420]   And she doesn't cite anything.
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.420]   In fact, the only evidence she cites is two studies that say this couldn't possibly be
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:32.420]   true, says that kids today are downloading digital beats that are designed to get you
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   high.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.420]   She says it's a gateway drug.
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.140]   Well, I think her audience is-- she's got a totally-- she has a totally different
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.140]   audience to do.
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:41.140]   Well, the point is she does.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:44.140]   She has the audience of normal people who are going to be terrified.
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.140]   Anybody who listens to us is going to go normal.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.140]   No, they're going to go, come on.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:49.140]   You're insane.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:54.140]   But what I'm afraid of is there's a bunch of little old ladies who are going to read this
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:57.140]   and say, oh, no, the internet is distributing drugs.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:59.140]   Well, those are the people on AOL that probably listened to her anyway.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:02.140]   Can I get that on AOL?
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:05.140]   Is this music-- is the album named "Dark Side of the Moon" by any chance?
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.140]   Because I seem to remember it by childhood.
[01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.140]   So listening to "Dark Side of the Moon."
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.140]   What's the theory?
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:15.140]   So theory is that you're going to download whatever this is and you're going to get in
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:19.140]   some-- what does it maybe-- you get in a trance or there is some kind of--
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:21.140]   Let me read you from the Wikipedia article.
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.140]   As we know, the Wikipedia.
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.140]   That's right.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:24.140]   That's right.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.140]   Bastion of all knowledge.
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:28.140]   You don't yet have a Mahalo page, right?
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.140]   I'd read from that.
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:30.140]   One of your popes is in there.
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:34.140]   Binaural beats or binaural tones are auditory processing artifacts or apparent sounds.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:39.140]   The perception of which arises in the brain independent of physical stimuli.
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:46.140]   This effect was discovered in 1839 by Heinrich Wilhelm Dov or Dové.
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:55.140]   So apparently, they're interest to neurophysiologists investigating hearing, but also they may influence
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.140]   the brains through the-- this is so--
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.140]   This is like licking frogs.
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.140]   This is-- no, it's not that.
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.140]   That's something.
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:03.140]   This is made up.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:04.140]   This is nuts.
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.140]   I'm going to play some.
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.140]   Hold on a minute, hang on a second.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.140]   Let me get myself glasses.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:09.140]   Can I play some?
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:11.140]   It's going to affect an entire audience.
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:13.140]   Do you think there will be a--
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:14.140]   Yeah, docis.
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.140]   docis.
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.140]   There will be a liability.
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:20.140]   Kim Command, I'm going to play some binaural beats because I'm a pusher.
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.140]   Let me see if I can find them here.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:24.140]   Jason, if I start saying dude-- okay.
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:27.140]   If I start saying dude, take me away.
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.140]   Pull me away.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.140]   This is from healingbeats.com.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:32.140]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.140]   Listen now.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.140]   At your peril.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:39.140]   You may get high when you hear.
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:42.140]   They're very low.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.140]   I guess-- oh, it's not music.
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:45.140]   It was subliminal.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.140]   Well, it is.
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.140]   Can you hear it?
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:48.140]   It's very low.
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:50.140]   There are a lot of barking dogs outside.
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:53.140]   This is called chakra.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.140]   Must eat brains.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:56.140]   Can you hear it?
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.140]   It's just going.
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:59.140]   Oh, I-- you hear it?
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:00.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:01.140]   That's it.
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:04.140]   This is called delta box.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:09.140]   A little number we call delta box.
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.140]   Here it comes.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:11.140]   Coming right at you now.
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:14.140]   We play the binaural beats on twit.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:15.140]   You think we'll get sued?
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:18.140]   Somebody who's parent, some parent, who says my kid.
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:19.140]   I hear something.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.140]   I can identify something.
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.140]   You hear that?
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.140]   Dvorak.org/prod.
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.140]   Are you hear that?
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:24.140]   Us.
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:25.140]   Devorak.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:28.140]   It's just like a--
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.140]   Mm-hmm.
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.140]   That's making me want to eat some cream puff, son.
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:35.140]   There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man.
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:39.140]   It is a dimension to traverse the space of tablets as it is.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.140]   It goes hind-- it goes hindrick.
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.140]   In night and shadow.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.140]   Which is inside.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.140]   Superstition.
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.140]   It lies.
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:49.140]   Between the pit of fan spheres and the summit of its knowledge.
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:51.140]   It's the dimension of imagination.
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:54.140]   It is in his area which we call the twilat.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:55.140]   I can't believe you know that.
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:56.140]   The Twitter Zone.
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.140]   How do you know that?
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:59.140]   I'm reading it from the--
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:00.140]   Oh.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:01.140]   I'm a Wikipedia page.
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:02.140]   It's a very impressed.
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.140]   All right, enough of the binaural pieces.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.140]   Anybody feel high?
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.140]   I got nothing.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:08.140]   Nothing.
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:09.140]   I got a headache.
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.140]   I don't know.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:11.140]   Nick, it's my brain tonic.
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.140]   It's working us on it.
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.140]   You have some brain tonic.
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:14.140]   That's good.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:15.140]   That stuff works.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.140]   Brain tonic in you.
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:17.140]   Brain tonic, right on your head.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.140]   Just pour it right on your head.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:20.140]   Where do they get the design of this body?
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:22.140]   I think it's anything to do with the red bull.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:23.140]   I mean, it's kind of--
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:24.140]   No, it's no.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:25.140]   There's no caffeine.
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:26.140]   There's no--
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.140]   I like the IQ at the end.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.140]   Brain tonic.
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:29.140]   IQ.
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.140]   Get it?
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.140]   Get it?
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:32.140]   Get the camera.
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.140]   There you go.
[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:34.140]   Brain tonic.
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:37.140]   The core tron in the IRC room says he's coming down.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.140]   He wants another hit.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:41.140]   The IRC room's coming down.
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:44.140]   We want some cream puffs of brain tonic, man.
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:47.140]   And if you place the beats while we listen.
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.140]   Apple engineers talking about an unhappy employee.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:52.140]   These Apple engineers say--
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.140]   This is from the unofficial Apple web blog, which by the way,
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.140]   I started.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:57.140]   You started.
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:59.140]   It is one of the web blogs.
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:02.140]   Companies have been told not to post anymore.
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.140]   On Monday, a group of--
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:05.140]   Maybe there is a certain affinity.
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.140]   Maybe that's why they're publishing this story.
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:10.140]   Apple engineers, a group of Apple technical staffers,
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:15.140]   filed suit against Apple on Monday alleging the company denied them over time and meal
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:17.140]   compensation required by California law.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:23.140]   The suit also claims many Apple employees are subjected to working conditions that are similar to indentured
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:25.140]   servitude.
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:31.140]   The lead plaintiff was an Apple network engineer from 1995 to 2007, says,
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:34.140]   "I was often required to work more than 40 hours a week.
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:40.140]   Miss Meals had spent evenings and weekends on call without any overtime pay or meal
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:41.140]   compensation."
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:42.140]   The horror.
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:43.140]   The horror.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.140]   Over 40 hours.
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:45.140]   That's indentured.
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.140]   I mean, really.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:49.140]   I think they need to understand what indentured servitude means.
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:50.140]   That's horrible.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.140]   You're ripped.
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:52.140]   Go on.
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:54.140]   The chairs that they get, and that's Steve Fellow.
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:55.140]   That's rude.
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:57.140]   Where's the indentured part?
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.140]   That's what I'm trying to figure out.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.140]   Maybe they thought--
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:04.140]   If people do this over and over again, what's going to happen is they're just going to move
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:08.140]   all the jobs overseas and they're just going to put everybody as independent contract.
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.140]   Oh, that already happened.
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:11.140]   Yeah, too late.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.140]   Too late.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:13.140]   Oh, yes.
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:15.140]   I am an indentured servant and I like it.
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:16.140]   That's correct.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.140]   I would be glad to do that for you.
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:19.140]   Just look at the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:20.140]   It's pathetic.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:21.140]   Over in India.
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:22.140]   Really?
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:23.140]   That's everything's moved on.
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:24.140]   But generics, you can't even make any money in that business.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:26.140]   I wonder if Steve Jobs-- oh, no.
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.140]   Steve didn't have anything to do with this.
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:30.140]   Apple pulled the phone saber from the iTunes store.
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:31.140]   What do you mean the phone?
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:32.140]   They pulled it.
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:33.140]   What?
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:34.140]   You're talking about the-- I have that.
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:35.140]   I'll fight you any time.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.140]   All right.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.140]   Get your phone saber out.
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:38.140]   Oh, where's mine?
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.140]   Oh, it's gone.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.140]   I put it-- they can't take it.
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:41.140]   No, they can't take it.
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:44.140]   No, but apparently Lucas complained.
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.140]   THQ--
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.140]   Wow.
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:47.140]   Wow.
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:49.140]   This is a show about people.
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:50.140]   Wow.
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:51.140]   This is definitely a winer.
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:53.140]   This is the winer's stuff.
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.140]   THQ--
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:59.140]   I'm not going to buy any more Star Wars material because I have a lightsaber on my iPhone.
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.140]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:01.140]   You know, that's really going to put them out of business.
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:02.140]   That was the first one that I would show people.
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:03.140]   Hey, look at this.
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.140]   They're like, what is it?
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.140]   I don't know, but it's so cool.
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:11.140]   Well, there's a company that apparently has the license to do all mobile phone Star Wars stuff.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.140]   And they didn't do it.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:18.140]   But apparently, unlike Hasbro, which didn't make a deal with Scrabulous, these guys are
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:25.140]   going to make a deal with the phone saber guys and make a really good Star Wars branded
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.140]   phone saber.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.140]   So that was Steve who approved that too.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:29.140]   I mean, obviously.
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.140]   Steve, Steve, Steve.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.140]   You got to really get him together.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:32.140]   You need that list.
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:36.140]   I have a question.
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:39.140]   George Lucas can stop the lightsaber on the iPhone.
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:42.140]   Why couldn't he stop Jar Jar Binks from being the first one?
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:43.140]   Jar Jar Binks.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.140]   He's a love that guy.
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:47.140]   He has a really, really, a vocabulary on that guy.
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.140]   He needs work.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:51.140]   We suck on the V-famous and rich.
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:52.140]   He's the iPhone.
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.140]   That would be great.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:54.140]   That would be great.
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:56.140]   I hate the piece of rich.
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:58.140]   That's, that's, judge a big spot that $999.
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:02.140]   Listen, you could have had that or a replay of that job of the hut fellow.
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:03.140]   I think piece of face.
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:04.140]   That was bad too.
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:05.140]   That was bad too.
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:09.140]   So Apple apparently, according to CNET, Apple does have a kill switch on the iPhone.
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:10.140]   Did you see this?
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:16.140]   Apparently, they have the technical ability to kill any app if it should, you know, I don't
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.140]   know what.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.140]   Wait, you mean good ground?
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:20.860]   Get, get, get, it should become sentient and try to rule the world.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:22.780]   I don't know what, I don't know what it is.
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:24.140]   But they have a kill, a kill switch.
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:25.140]   They've seen it.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:26.140]   I don't think so.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:27.140]   Come on.
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:29.900]   They're probably, you know, that, that's just to, you know, I don't believe it.
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:32.140]   Let me, let me, let me give you a back to the war.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:33.140]   That's bogus.
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:34.140]   That's bogus.
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.140]   I don't know.
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:37.140]   Chinese guy, Chinese guy, Chinese guy.
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.140]   They, they watch, they watch the Terminator one too many times.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:43.140]   And they think they like, they, they, they see engineers and they want to work 35 hours
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.140]   a week.
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:45.140]   They go to France.
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:46.140]   So here's the deal.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:47.140]   It's a deal.
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:49.140]   And the Tesla's not coming.
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:51.740]   Yeah, by the way, when are you getting your Tesla?
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:52.740]   It looks like September.
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.940]   They delivered for last week.
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:56.860]   Larry and Sergey, I think.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:00.260]   What, what, what, uh, gelopy you driving now?
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:05.180]   Right now I'm pushing the Corvette C6 and Mercedes GL 550.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.180]   At the same time?
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:07.180]   Okay.
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:08.180]   And I got a mini Cooper.
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:11.540]   When do you drive, do you drive the mini Cooper to beard poppers?
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:12.540]   Is that what that's for?
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.700]   That's my, you know, when I was broke, I bought the mini Cooper.
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:15.700]   I like the mini.
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.340]   So you get, you go, when you go to drive, when you go to drive throughs and stuff, you don't
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:19.780]   want to drive the, the, the Mercedes.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.060]   It's great for the, it's great dog car.
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:23.780]   You know, you don't want to bring the Merck to a in and out.
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:24.780]   So you drive the Cooper.
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:26.940]   Yeah, I like the Cooper.
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:27.940]   Jonathan, Jonathan.
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:28.940]   Jonathan, Jonathan.
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:30.500]   You're all right.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   It's awesome.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.340]   Jonathan Zajarski, who is an independent iPhone developer, discovered a URL while poking
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:39.940]   around in the iPhone two software that downloads a list of malicious applications every once
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:43.180]   in a while to the iPhone.
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:47.140]   And apparently the idea being that, now there's nothing on this list right now.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:51.780]   The idea being, if there were anything, the iPhone would go to this site, see it and kill
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.780]   it.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:56.220]   I think that runs in the background.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:59.500]   Apparently the iPhone checks this website every once in a while.
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.060]   Which is probably why the battery is so horrible on it.
[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.060]   Exactly.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.060]   That's honestly checking that site.
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:06.020]   Hey, let me have something about the same situation.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:08.700]   You know, I was thinking, you know, I was at a conference this week and everybody's given
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.540]   out these little key USB keychain things.
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:13.540]   Yeah, that's the key.
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:15.380]   And yeah, but what's interesting about that, you used to give it out to you.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:16.980]   You didn't have a little storage thing and had a name on it.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.500]   Now they said, plug it in and we'll take it on a website.
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.660]   I'm thinking, what a great tool.
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:22.660]   It is.
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:24.180]   What a great tool to whack somebody's computer.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:26.180]   Oh, it is.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:27.180]   There we talk about, you should listen to security now.
[01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:28.180]   We talk about this all the time.
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:31.660]   This uses that U3 technology that ought to launch this stuff.
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:33.660]   And there are hacker toolkits that go on these things.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:34.660]   You know, here's what you do.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.380]   If you're a hacker, you go to a public terminal, maybe a library or whatever.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:40.580]   You plug the USB key into the terminal.
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:42.860]   It checks to see if the hacking software has been installed.
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:44.820]   If it hasn't, it installs it and you walk away.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:46.580]   It takes 15, 20 seconds.
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:50.140]   Next time you come back, that software has been logging all the key strokes on that machine.
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:53.020]   You go back, it does the same check and says, oh, it's here.
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:54.820]   Download the key strokes and you walk away.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:55.820]   Nice.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:57.500]   It's a great way to, oh, it's very dangerous technology.
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:58.900]   And I think it's pretty innocent.
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:00.460]   People don't really know when it's a freebie.
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:01.460]   Yeah, don't use it.
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:02.460]   Oh, I get a freebie.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:03.460]   Oh, plug it in.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.340]   People are, doesn't that ring any alarm bells for anybody?
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:06.340]   No.
[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:08.460]   Here's somebody's giving me a USB key and I'm just going to plug it in and let it run
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:09.700]   and do anything it wants.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.700]   No, they think it's free.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:11.700]   Who's paying for it?
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.700]   It's like the 800 number.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.700]   Who pays for it?
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:14.700]   Have we?
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:16.700]   Have we learned anything from Sony?
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.180]   Lenovo's quarterly sales, very strong.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:24.420]   10.5% increase in their first quarter fiscal, first quarter revenues overseas, not going
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:25.420]   to stand overseas.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:27.900]   Why is overseas sales doing better than US sales?
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.660]   Because you can do it for one sale with a dollar.
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:31.660]   I mean, it's to me.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.660]   But Lenovo's a Chinese company.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.980]   Yeah, but it all flows through IBM.
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:42.740]   You know, we'll go through that whole sales up in the Europe Middle East in Africa, 26%.
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:46.580]   Asian Pacific sales up 11%.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:47.580]   America's not down.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:52.380]   It's the same report that has been for every single company.
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:53.380]   Every couple too.
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:54.740]   So Apple was vice versa.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.820]   Apple doesn't have strong international sales and they've done very, very strong international
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:58.820]   sales.
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:00.580]   Everybody the same exact report.
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:01.900]   Even though they use indentured servants?
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:02.900]   Yes.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:04.660]   That's where they actually saved some money this year.
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:09.940]   By the way, France got rid of the 35-hour work week this year when Sarkozy got in.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.700]   It's like 32 now.
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:14.140]   No, no, no, they got rid of it.
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:17.380]   In France, you actually legally couldn't, if you wanted to work at a startup, you couldn't
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.380]   work more than 35 hours.
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:19.380]   You're kidding.
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:20.380]   Breaking the law.
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:21.380]   You're kidding.
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:22.380]   That's ridiculous.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:23.380]   What would you do with the other US?
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.500]   Is that so you could have long lunches?
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:28.640]   You're basically supposed to just get up from your desk and you're like, "Oh, well, my company
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:32.700]   is competing on this global scale and we all want to get rich, but we can only work 35
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:33.700]   hours a week."
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:37.020]   You'd be like telling Michael Jordan, "You can take 100 shots in practice a week, but
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.020]   that's it."
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.420]   Oh, and by the way, I'm not coming in at all.
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:45.020]   How do you go back to work after having drinks in a sea yesterday for four hours in the afternoon?
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:49.020]   I can barely have water in the middle of the day and survive the rest of the day.
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.020]   You know it's a rest of what?
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.020]   You have to be there.
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.020]   It's fine.
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.020]   You take a nap.
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:54.020]   You'll be back.
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:55.020]   It's okay.
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.020]   I come in for a few hours.
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:57.020]   We'll wrap this up.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.020]   There's no problem.
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:00.020]   This week attack is brought to you by France.
[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:01.020]   France.
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:02.020]   France.
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:03.020]   You can 35 hours a week.
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:04.020]   Great country.
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:05.780]   All right, I'm going to wrap this up.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:06.780]   You guys are great.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:10.300]   I really appreciate you taking the time to join us this week.
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:11.300]   And I'm not talking to our panelists.
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.660]   I'm talking to you, our audience.
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:17.500]   If I could give each and every one of you a cream puff I would.
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:22.900]   Don't forget, of course, Jason Callicannis is at mahalo.com and in a Tesla near use coming
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:23.900]   soon.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:25.460]   Will you do a road trip up here when you get the Tesla?
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:26.460]   Come on up.
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.740]   It goes 250 miles, so I wouldn't make it, but maybe I'll get the only one.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:31.220]   Or when you come down here, we'll go for a ride.
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:32.220]   Oh, that's a bummer.
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:33.220]   What's up here?
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.620]   I think I'd have to stay overnight somewhere and then plug in.
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:37.620]   Paris Ranch.
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:38.620]   You plug it in and here.
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:39.620]   It's a ranch.
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.620]   Have a nice steak.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.620]   How long does it take charge?
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:42.620]   It depends.
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:46.100]   If you're on the 220 volt, which is like a dryer plug, I think it takes like six hours.
[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:48.260]   If you're on a regular, very straight.
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:51.860]   Yeah, like 20 hours on a regular plug.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.860]   And you're just a top off.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:54.460]   And it's got the lithium ion batteries.
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:55.980]   You're not talking lead batteries here.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:56.980]   No, no.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:57.980]   It's a good, good ones.
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.980]   And they're going to come out with the battery pack.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:00.740]   I think in a year or two, that's better.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:03.660]   I think providing the battery packs to Mercedes.
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:06.420]   There's a rumor that they're providing battery packs to Mercedes.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:11.500]   And Mercedes is going to come out with electric cars with Tesla.
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.460]   Very good.
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:16.220]   I want to be you.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.060]   You are doing something right now.
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:18.580]   I want to be you.
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:19.580]   You are Andrew Horowitz.
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.580]   You can't be him.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:21.580]   I could tell you the secret to my success.
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:22.580]   Oh.
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:24.580]   Broken clock right twice a day.
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:25.580]   I just keep trying.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:26.580]   You know, I'm only.
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:27.580]   So you get to.
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:28.580]   I hit two balls.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.580]   You get to.

[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:34.660]   You know, don't read into it too much.
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:36.220]   Andrew Horowitz is the discipline investor.
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:37.540]   He's doing pretty well.
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.540]   You could see his book on bookstores everywhere.
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:40.540]   Of course Audible dot com.
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:43.140]   His podcast, The Discipline Investor, is that?
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.140]   The podcast is that iTunes.
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:46.180]   You get to get there and go to disciplineinvestor.com.
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:49.980]   And since you always want everybody to be pushing that Twitter up all the way.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:50.980]   Yeah, what's your Twitter?
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:51.980]   I don't want my Twitter.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:56.780]   Go to iTunes and let's see if we can get that podcast all the way up to first place on business.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:57.780]   I've been there once.
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:59.620]   I've found number 10 or so in business.
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.620]   So check it out.
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:01.900]   There's some great ways to make money on there.

[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:22.580]   We'll get you back with a less talkative crowd.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.500]   So you get a word in edgewise once in a while.
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:26.940]   Great to talk to you Peter.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:27.940]   Thank you.
