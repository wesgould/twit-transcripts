[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   >> Is that what the hair's about?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Is trying to give you a height?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> What's--
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   >> It actually still looks like guile from Street Fighter II.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   >> Oh, yeah, that's nice.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> Basically.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   >> That's fair.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   That other voice-- we haven't heard this voice in a long time.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's so nice to see Mr. Roger Chang on the show.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   >> Ooh.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   >> Roger, we missed you!
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   >> Aw, I tried to make it up here more often than--
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> Well, now that we know there's wine involved, I hope you
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   will come up more often.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   >> No, you're not a wine drinker.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I can get you fruit juice.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   >> Sure.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Or a rum.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   >> A rum?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> They go hand in hand, really.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   >> Roger Chang is-- you are now at--
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   at the revision three part of the Tekzilla team.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> Yes.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> I do produce Tekzilla and system.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   >> That's great.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   >> And we--
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   >> Are you on camera much?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Do you get much camera time?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   >> I did the last system and that's just because we're trying
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   to manage our budget, so it doesn't cost me to cost me.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> To book yourself.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   >> That's all fun.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And the pre-interview is very quick.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   >> Yes.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   >> Roger, do you know anything?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   No, I don't.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Okay, fine.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You're great for the show.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We're signed up.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Well, so nice to see you.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I really appreciate you coming up.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You're the greatest.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   How's the folks in Modesto, the seafood--
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   >> Good.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   >> --Gally, it's gone well.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   >> Fisherman's Gally still going.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's-- that whole town's kind of weird still.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It's probably gotten weird since it became a car theft capital
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   of the United States.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   >> They call it fat city.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> PHAT or--
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   >> No, just F-A-T.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> F-A-T.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> And well, what's funny is because of the past ten years,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   so many people from the East Bay of San Francisco were moving
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   out there because housing was so affordable and now with the
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   kind of--
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   >> Now the crash--
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   >> -- there's a bunch of--
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   >> -- that literally have track homes,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   those rows and rows of it that are empty because no one bought
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   into them.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   >> You know what's sad is in this recession is that people are
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   stuck in their homes.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   They buy homes, they get upside down, and then the job
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   leaves, but they can't because they're stuck in the house.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   >> Well, in some cases, people are betting that it's probably
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   easier to bite the bullet and just--
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   >> Just leave.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   >> -- default.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> -- leave the keys.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   >> -- walk away.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   >> -- and just walk away.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   >> Oh, that's sad.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Also here, ladies and gentlemen, the beautiful, the talented,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   friendly--
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> -- I'm not--
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   >> -- I wasn't going to say that.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   >> -- host of her new sound board.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   >> -- Sarah Lane!
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   >> Hi, Nick!
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   >> Hi, Nick!
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   >> -- from--
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   >> -- I want to say, I'm happy to say from this weekend fun,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   which is soon to be a podcast near you.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> Yeah, tomorrow.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   >> Yeah, we're going to make an audio version of that,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   the first one, and we have old ones that we'll probably put out
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   as well.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   >> Oh, I would love that.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   >> With Martin Sargent, that's a show--
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   she does live here on Twit Live every Friday at 6 p.m.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Eastern, 3 p.m.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Pacific.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   >> Correct, which is super fun.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   >> That's kind of--
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   what is a--
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   it shows kind of like just kind of wacky.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   >> It's-- you know, this is a good-- this we can fun, really.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   This would be--
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   >> This would be-- this we can fun.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   >> It could be.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   >> You know, if you want to add wine to this weekend fun,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   be my guest.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   >> I will.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Well, just make sure it's from the right source.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   >> Yeah, we've got to be careful with Martin because he's,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   you know, he's a real lightweight, that Sargent.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   >> This is--
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   >> Uh-huh.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   >> Is it really?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> That's funny.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   >> Not at all.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   >> Seems like he'd have really good resistance.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   >> Yeah, no, he's had many years of practice.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   He's pretty good.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   >> Yes, so we're part of the group here, but I am thrilled to be part
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   of Twit.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It's been a while since I was up here.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   >> Has it really been?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   >> On a Sunday, yeah.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   >> I feel like we see you all the time, but you're right.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   >> Um--
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   >> Coming up on a Sunday is something different.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   >> I think it's-- I think it was 2008 last time I was here.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   >> Oh, son.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   >> What?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   >> It's a totally different year.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   >> On a Sunday, yeah.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   >> That's a whole different year.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   >> That's a whole different-- I mean, it's--
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   >> Wow.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   >> Seems like yesterday.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   >> Well, let's talk a little bit about the tech stories in the news.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I have a few of them.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Not a whole lot.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I think the story that's really irritating people this week is
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Time Warner.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   They've announced-- and it's irritating me because, frankly,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   everything I do requires huge amounts of bandwidth.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   They were trying it in Texas.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   They're trying data caps, and they've announced that they're now
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   going to spread them to some other Time Warner customers really
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   kind of signal this is going to be permanent.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   40 gigabyte caps per month on your download.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Now Comcast gives you--
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   >> 250.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   >> 250.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   >> 250.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   >> 250.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   >> 250 gives you 150.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   >> 40 is a little low.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   >> You know, I'm in one of those markets, Austin, Texas.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   >> You're going to be bit.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Now, are you a Time Warner customer?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   >> I am a Time Warner customer.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   >> How do you feel about this?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   >> Well, I've always done the Time Warner Roadrunner Turbo,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   which is awesome.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Like, they guarantee at least 15 megabits down,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   and I usually get like 22 megabits down.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   >> That's great.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   >> But now you may not want to have so much bandwidth.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Because that means you eat up your cap quicker.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   >> Well, I did some detective work.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I actually called Time Warner this morning and talked to the folks
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   over in tech support and said, "I'm a little bit concerned
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   about, you know, crazy bandwidth caps," or actually, I guess,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   download caps.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And the guy had this kind of attitude you could tell that he had
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   been dealing with this all morning.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And he was like, "Ugh."
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   >> And article.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   >> And--
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   >> So it's not true.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   >> Well, according to some faceless person I spoke, you know,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   onto a phone queue, basically, he said, "No."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   His exact words were, he was like, "Well, we're trying it out
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   to see how people react."
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   >> These are--
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   >> So that's--
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   >> No, well, I produce--
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   >> B.S., they're doing it.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   But when I brought it up, he was like, "Besides, I want to
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   affect you, you're a Turbo customer anyway.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   You could do whatever you want."
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   >> And I was like, "Well, yeah, but if the cap is 40 and he
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   cut me off," he was like, "The cap is not 40."
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And so--
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And I was like, "Well, how do you know?"
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   He's like, "We have internal--"
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I mean, the cap's not going to be 40.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   >> All right, let me read to you from Business Week Magazine
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   in April.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   In Business Week, this is fairly credible.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   We're not making this up.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Tom Lowry writing.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   "In April, Time Warner Cable will begin, and you must like
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   this, Brian, collecting information on its customers'
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   internet use in the Texas cities of Austin and San Antonio
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and in Rochester, New York.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Consumption billing--"
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Boy, those two words you don't want to hear.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   "-- will begin in those cities later this summer."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   So what he's telling you is, "No, not yet."
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   >> Right.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   >> Right.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   >> No, yet.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   >> When he's saying that-- and now here's something quirky
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   that I don't know that I believe.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I could tell that they all had a team meeting and they wanted
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   this to be the line, but he said, "Well, if you sign up
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   for two-year contract, you get the price guarantee."
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   >> That's probably true, right?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   >> And there's no way even if we do put a cap in there,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   we're not allowed to change it.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   >> I would look at the--
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   >> I'm the same way, because I'm just like, "I know that's
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   what you're telling me now, and we're having a conversation here."
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   >> I'm willing to bet that Yula says that at any time we can
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   impose additional strictures and limitations on your use.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   >> But he did-- I felt him out and I said, "Well, can you give me
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   some idea what the cap would be for Reels?"
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   He was like, "Oh, I don't know, 100, 200."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   >> No!
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   >> That's what he--
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   >> Well, that's what he said.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   >> Or he began to every gig you go over as a buck.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   >> Is a buck, right?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   >> Oh, holy.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   >> And that's going to add up fast.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   >> Wait, wait, how much do you pay right now for that complete
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   service, including taxes and all that?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   >> It's over 50 bucks.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   It's somewhere between 50 and 60 dollars.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   >> Would you pay 100 bucks if you had like--
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   >> Then you'd have 80 gigs, right?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   >> Or like no cap--
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   >> No cap--
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   >> No bandwidth cap or a higher bandwidth cap.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   >> Let me tell you, I probably would because there was a time
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   back in the old old days, Austin was not first on the high-speed
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   bandwagon, and there was a time I paid 120 bucks a month for
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   the satellite junk for just the one way, for dial-up up and high-speed
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   down for like 1.5 megabits.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   >> Yeah, but you know what, there are people in Japan paying 20 bucks
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   for 100 megabits down.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I mean, this is not because it actually costs that much money to
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   these guys.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   This is anti-competitive.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   This is Time Warner saying, we're in the TV business, and if you
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   should download too much TV, we're not going to make any money,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   so we want to limit.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   You could surf, you could do email, but don't you download any
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   high-def movies or iTunes?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   >> Have you noticed how quickly they've given up the P2P
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   straw man?
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   It's like they're not even asking like it's a bit too hard
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   related.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   >> This is their real response, right?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And it is, you know what, it isn't just P2P.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   It's Hulu, it's iTunes, it's all the other places you get it from.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   >> It's the high bandwidth stuff which tends to be video.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   >> And tends to be what I do, which is where--
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   >> It tends to be a lot more available than ever.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   >> I mean, you'd be honest.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   >> HD videos are really--
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   >> I have cable modem and I get the 250 cap, but you know, I'm
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   probably going to cancel my expanded basic and just go to
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   with basic.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   >> That's what they hate because they don't watch you.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   >> I've already done that.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   >> Because I watch Netflix off my Xbox because there are Netflix
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   on the man.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   >> But see, that's what happens.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   You stream high-def Netflix.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   This is what they're terrified of.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   They don't make nearly as much money off of you as they do
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   with an HBO subscription.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   >> Now, I wonder what it would take to change that.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I mean, is the problem that Hulu is just not charging enough
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   for their ads?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   If they were making more money from the ads,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   would all of a sudden they prefer that you watch the ads on Google?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   >> No, no, no.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Cable doesn't make money from the shows that get produced.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   They get money from the carriage fees.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   So if they don't have anything to carry other than data,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I mean, then the amount they can charge you for like HBO showtime
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   or even like when they give you those special sports package
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   or the Discovery Science package, they make money off that.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And if people aren't going to watch it, well, they're not making
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   that money that they have been making.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   >> Cable's business model is based on premium content.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   >> Yes.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   >> They're not a commodity service.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   They're not a utility.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   If it just comes down to bits, they can't make enough money.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And they're screwed.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And so, but this is to me, this is any competitive.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   This is cable time Warner Cable saying, well, you know, you better not do this
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   because we're going to charge a buck a gigabyte.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   >> Well, I'll tell you this much.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It sounded, I got every impression from this.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Nobody I spoke to on a tech line that if people make a stink,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   they're listening.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Like this is a tentative step and, you know, who knows?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   >> Make a stink.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   >> Yeah, make a stink.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Yeah, that's, I mean, I told them, I was like, look, if there's any cap,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I'm switching to a different company.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And the problem is though, who do you switch to?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   >> Well, that's what he said.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   He said, well, you're going to switch to AT&T.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   >> See, they know this.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   >> They know this.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   AT&T is 150.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   See, they know this.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   There's not really competition in this market, is there?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   I mean, yeah, that's the real problem is that there's.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   >> At my house, I only have one choice.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   >> You don't even have DSL?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   >> No.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   >> DSL.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   >> So the best you got DSL and cable, right?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   That's it.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And they're colluding anyway.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   >> PG&E does like, you know, start supporting fiber through their gas lines.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   >> I would like to decide to put the gas fiber network.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   >> When I was in college, a couple of students from Belgium were saying that the, is it
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Antwerp that's the capital of Belgium?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   >> Yes.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   >> They were running fiber optic lines.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   The utilities were running fiber optic lines through the gas line because it was the most
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   affordable way to lay out energy.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   >> You mean they say like, feed it into the pipe?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   >> And because it's light, it's not going to turn, it's not going to ignite the gas.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   >> And it's your running it over there.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   >> That's a relief.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   >> Well, I mean, you know, it's like trying to light a candle with a flashlight.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   It's not going to ignite the gas.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   You've got nothing to fear.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Wow.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   >> But.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   >> So they get like, feed it into the pipe?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   >> You already have that infrastructure.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   >> I never thought of that.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   That's an interesting point.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   >> And then they would come out into that residence or they would, you know, put up the little
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   unit and then just feed it into the homes.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   >> I'm just, it makes me a little bit nervous because I just feel like it's me and you,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Brian and you, Roger, that they're coming after and you, Sarah Lane, all the people who
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   are doing internet video, these are the ones that scare them the most.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   >> You know what it reminds me of is when gas prices were high and all of the airlines
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   instituted carriage fees for the baggage.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Now you pay a first bag fee, a second bag fee, a third.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And now gas prices are back down.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   >> Well, yeah, the fees that they go away from.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   >> And it's the same thing here.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It used to be the P2B was the big boogie man.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   It's all bit torn.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   It's all these losers fault.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And then now, and now they're not even claiming they're like, you guys are watching too much
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   video.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Is it Netflix?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   >> They're right.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Someone just corrected me.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Brussels is the capital of Belcher.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   >> What did you say?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   >> That's the damn point.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   >> And I thought.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   >> I don't even remember him saying, Belcher.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   >> You don't even remember him saying, Belcher.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   >> You don't even remember him saying, Belcher.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   >> You don't even remember him saying, Belcher.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   >> I got Antwerp.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   >> I didn't realize that was an ad.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   You guys were quoting.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I thought this was a popular song that I was not aware of.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   >> You're someone hip.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Don't you know the worst song ever?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   >> Hey, that's the name of my new band, The Shane Company.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   That'd be a good band.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   >> Now it's just Shane Co.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   >> Shane Co.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   >> Shane Co.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   >> That's so sad.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   >> Is that sad?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   >> I actually really want to meet Tom Shane.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I've been listening to him for so many years.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   >> I think he might be a pretty good band.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   >> They're California.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   >> They're from California.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   >> They're from California?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   >> No, I thought they were everywhere.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   >> I don't think they go any farther south than St.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   >> There's a lot of people listening who have no idea what we're talking about.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   >> Oh, he's great.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Look up Tom Shane.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   >> Yeah, he hawks diamonds.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And you know what?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   If you're planning to invest money, don't invest it in diamonds.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   You're probably one of the worst investments you can make.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   >> De Beers can take you down.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   >> Well.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   >> Invest in golders, you know, platinum.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   >> I'm going to invest in fine wine.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   >> Jules might beg to differ with you.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   >> Diamonds are the girl's best friend.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   >> Yeah, but gold will give you a better return over the long time.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   >> No girl's going to want to hear that, are you?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   >> That's a great line.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   >> Welcome to the weekend paranoia.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   >> I don't think Marilyn Monroe is saying it that way, did she?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Diamonds are a girl's best friend.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   >> The gold has a better return.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   >> Hey, you know what?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   If you can insert it at the end, why not?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   >> There's another one for the Roger Chang sound bore, actually.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   >> Yes.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   >> We're going to take a break.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   When we come back, I want to talk about Netflix because we were, we kind of started a Netflix
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   conversation.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   There are two billionth delivery, but there's trouble in the Netflix garden of Eden.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   There's trouble ahead.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I do want to mention our friends at carbonite.com.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Carbonite is online, backup done right.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I'm a big fan of carbonite.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   As many of you know, I use carbonite after the incident.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   We just hear around the Twit cottage call it the incident.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   >> The incident and you're okay.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   You're moving on.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   >> I survived the incident, but it wasn't a happy incident.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   >> No.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   >> Do you know what the incident was?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   You're sounding like you know what the incident was?
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   >> I do not know.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   >> Well, I didn't --
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   >> What happened?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   >> I think I can infer that there was a problem.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   >> There was a problem.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I recorded -- okay, first, I recorded two floss weeklies with -- I think it was Brian
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Acre, lost them both.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   >> So we called him back, said we lost your interview.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Can we do it again?
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   We did it again.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   We lost it again.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   >> Oh, eggy.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   >> I lost it again.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I accidentally erased it.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   So I had to send him a basket of fruits and vegetables.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   >> And squash.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   >> Like $100.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   >> Like $100.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   >> It was very -- no, I think I sent him a coffee basket.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   A lot of different coffee.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Because I think he's a programmer coffee, right?
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   >> Uh-huh.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   >> Then, this was worse.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   I lost 10 daily gizwizzes.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And that was when I said, I got to find a better way.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And that's when I found carbonite.com carbonite.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   You install it on your PC.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   I've got it running right now on the PC.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   In fact, you could try it free for two weeks right now if you go to carbonite.com and use
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   the offer code LEO.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   No credit card, nothing.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   You just try it.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   And what happens is immediately starts backing up your precious files, financial documents,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   photos, music, in my case, podcasts.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   >> By the way, I thought of carbonite when I heard about the --
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   >> The incident?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   >> The caps.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   No, no, no, the caps for time war.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   >> Well, there's a good example.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   >> If you've got a 200 gigabyte hard drive filled with valuable files, how are you going to
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   get that on the front?
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   >> Do that on the front.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   >> Do that on the front.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   >> Do that on the front.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   >> Do that on the front.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   >> Do that on the front.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   >> Do that on the front.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   >> Do that on the front.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   >> Do that on the front.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   >> Do that on the front.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   >> Yeah, I think that's pure usage.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   >> Oh, carbonite's got to really listen and pay attention and do something about this.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Well, fortunately, most of us don't have caps yet.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   It is unlimited from carbonite's end.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   And I've uploaded, I think more than 50 gigabytes worth of podcasts, $5 a month, less than $5 a month.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And so your carbonite's end, so your privacy is absolutely secure.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   You don't have to worry about that.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Restoration, just a couple of clicks in the mouse.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Now, look, your backup has to include local backup and we do that, but it also has to
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   include off-site backup.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And that's why I really think carbonite is a great solution.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   It just happens.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Back up in the background without your paying any attention to it.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   It's doing it right now.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   I don't have to worry about losing podcasts anymore.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I want you to give it a try.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   >> Can I ask one question about carbonite?
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   >> Yes, sir.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   >> And maybe I'm misremembering because my brain is idiotic, but I thought at some point that
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   they didn't upload media.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Like if you have any threes, so it's anything.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   >> Yeah.

[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   >> Yeah.

[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   >> Yeah.

[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   >> Yeah.

[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   >> And you connect to your Netflix.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   >> Okay.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   >> Well actually if you all go we're in trouble.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   >> You're all gonna take it off.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   >> Well that's been smoking.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   >> Don't everybody, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   >> No, it's down.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   >> You killed it.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   >> Dead.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   >> Diggity dang it.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   >> You gotta love wielding that kind of uncontrollable black power.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   >> I'm on.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   >> I kick it on.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   >> You're on.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   >> I kick it on.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   I'm on on the page that I went to before.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   >> Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   >> So anyway, feed Flix, what you do is you connect to your Netflix account and then it tells
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.600]   you how much per movie you're paying.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.440]   So I did it based on how often you return it, right?
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.440]   >> Yeah, right.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.640]   >> So I did it $92 a movie.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   >> Holy cow.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.800]   >> What's the matter with you people?
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   How proud is it?
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   >> I don't return it enough.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   >> There's no postage required.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.600]   >> But there's like, it's like, to me it's like DVD players.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.600]   >> Use it.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.600]   >> The thing is some of the, some of the-
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   >> I don't get it.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.600]   >> Why is it so hard?
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.160]   >> Man stuff though, the quality, they took a lot of stuff from stars and they're encoding
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   kind of stuff.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.160]   >> Oh really, is that how they got it?
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.160]   Is it from stars?
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.160]   >> Not all of it, some of it.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.960]   >> Yeah, some of it when you start them up on, you're talking about the digital distribution,
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   right?
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.120]   Yeah, it starts off with a stars movie.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.680]   My daughter watches the underdog movie a hundred times over and over and over again.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.000]   With the digital, it's cool because we do it on the Xbox.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.440]   She goes up and she hits go and there's underdog.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.280]   >> My other issue is I actually have a surround sound setup, so I enjoy surround sound.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.840]   You don't get that with the direct.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.840]   So unless I get- >> Now that's interesting.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.080]   Do you think that you're, that's a common situation or?
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.480]   >> Maybe, for people who've invested money in their home-
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.440]   >> It's not going to look good enough for you anyway.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.880]   You're going to want to see, well now here's the thing, I actually, the issue I wanted
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.400]   to bring up was I just got an email from Netflix.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.120]   They say, oh by the way, you want Blu-ray discs?
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.600]   >> You have to pay more.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.720]   >> Six bucks extra a month.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   What the hell?
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.520]   >> One buck, I want to cancel.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.000]   >> I think there's not enough Blu-ray people.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.400]   I honestly believe that- >> What's the deal with, no, that's greed.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.200]   >> I think for the most part, people just don't care.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.160]   >> I think the thing is there's not enough subscribers for the Blu-ray discs to make
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.520]   carrying a parallel inventory worthwhile without charging.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.840]   >> That's why they charge more?
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.840]   >> Uncertain.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.000]   >> Yeah, when you're moving physical stuff, it's ridiculous.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.240]   Everything gets super expensive.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.720]   >> But if you have to carry two of the same movie-
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.840]   >> That's their business model.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   What are you talking about?
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.840]   That's their business model.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.160]   You have to move physical stuff.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.960]   >> Yeah, but if you have to carry inventory, you can't say you have to have 100 of the
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960]   same movie.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.240]   Now you've got to carry 25 of the Blu-ray.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.960]   You've got to make sure the Blu-ray- >> So you're saying it's because nobody's doing
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.640]   Blu-ray that they're going to charge me five bucks more a month?
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   >> I think there's not enough.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.840]   >> Honestly, I think also like- >> No, I'm canceling.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.320]   There's going to be one fewer.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.280]   >> The only other thing I think of is that they're not getting a deal on getting Blu-ray discs.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.280]   >> That's one of the deals with Netflix, isn't it?
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.880]   That they have the Hollywood subsidizes the cost of the disc.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.000]   >> For the DVDs, but the Blu-ray could be totally different than Blu-ray.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   >> So starting April 12th on Blu-ray.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   >> The Internet.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   >> You're going to use the Netflix.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.920]   >> I'm using the Google.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.840]   I use the Netflix to get my movies.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.560]   >> Sorry about that, Roger.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.200]   >> It seems to me like Netflix has known since day one that the moving physical inventory
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.720]   days were numbered.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.280]   And I think it's brilliant the way they got started with the watch it now and I love what
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.480]   they're doing for it.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.120]   But it kind of makes me sad that they're even celebrating Blu-ray.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   I don't know.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   >> I love Blu-ray.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   I want Blu-ray.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.360]   I have a Sony PlayStation 3 and that's a perfect Blu-ray player.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.880]   And what I've done on Netflix when it was HD DVD, I said, "Okay, I prefer HD DVD now.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   It's Blu-ray."
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.560]   And now they're charging me six.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.400]   I mean, six bucks a month is a lot.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.560]   I mean, what is the Netflix?
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.560]   It's 20 bucks.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   I mean, that's a 50% or 30% increase.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.400]   >> I think it's- >> Six bucks a month.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.360]   I mean, no, it's not a lot of money, but it's too much for that.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.640]   It makes me- >> What it does is make me say, "Okay,
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   I'm just going to get DVD.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   I don't care about the Blu-ray."
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.640]   >> Right.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.440]   >> But that's exactly not what they want to do because-
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.000]   >> Well, it's not what the Blu-ray consortium wants to happen.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.120]   But for Netflix, it doesn't matter one way.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.280]   They're going to charge you for something.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.080]   >> I just have this picture of Sony for once ever actually winning a format war.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   >> Not this time.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.920]   >> And they're just standing alone in the arena and nobody's in the stairs.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   >> Nobody cares.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   >> And they're like, "We want, we want."
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   Nobody's there watching.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:40.720]   >> I mean, the problem is the Blu-ray players are still pricey, relatively speaking to DVDs.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:45.440]   The Blu-ray discs are title for title are still more expensive.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.200]   It's just why would people want to upgrade?
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.800]   I mean, most people, majority of people I still think might have a regular TV.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.560]   They don't have an HDTV.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.080]   >> I think- >> There are a lot of those folks.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.880]   And then folks like me who just simply, I know it looks better.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.160]   If it was- >> You don't care though.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.920]   >> If it was given to me, I'd be glad.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.040]   And I would watch it and say, "Well, it looks better, but I don't care enough to pay extra."
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.160]   >> And the bigger issue though is especially with a lot of people, they tend to watch movies
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.160]   not at home.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.320]   They tend to watch on the go on a laptop.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.680]   >> And then what's the point of Blu-ray for that?
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   >> If you're not going to, unless you have a Blu-ray drive, you're kind of your SOL, right?
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.560]   So you get the one you can, you drop it in while you're on a flight from New York out
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   to San Francisco.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.200]   >> What is that six bucks as a percentage of the regular cost of Netflix?
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.520]   We'll say 33%.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.760]   Okay, are Blu-ray movies when you're watching them on your laptop?
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.760]   >> Third, better?
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.360]   >> Yeah, is it 30 years and better?
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   >> No.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.560]   >> So is this the end of the line for Blu-ray?
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.440]   Is this like kind of the nail in the coffin that puts them out of business?
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.680]   >> No, I think it'll still survive, but I think it'll be one of-
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.480]   >> It's an audio, it's a video file format now.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.200]   >> Yeah, it's gonna be like- >> I think it'll be like the SACD.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   >> Or laser disc.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   >> I think it'll survive among video files.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.720]   I think among the people who, for whom that is really important to get a cinematic experience,
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.600]   and they'll be happy to pay that ridiculous premium.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.200]   >> It'd be funny if they start shipping those out to movie theaters.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.360]   Like here's your movie that you're gonna play.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.200]   >> The cracking we are.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.360]   When you go to a digital movie theater- >> Yeah, the 4K ones.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   >> Well not 4K.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   >> No, just the regular ones.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:19.200]   >> When you're going to the regular DLP cinema, which we have here in Peneloma, that's probably
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.560]   not, that's 1080p I bet, right?
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.560]   >> Really?
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.720]   >> I wouldn't, you know, and the thing is- >> That's 2K.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.320]   >> If you sit close enough, you can see the alias thing.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.880]   >> So it's not- >> Elmo, drop house.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.880]   >> Close to you.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.880]   >> You have to sit there.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.080]   >> Usually like, yeah, like either at the first row of the middle aisle or like in the-
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.000]   >> So that's where we'll find Roger Chang when we go to the movies.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.480]   >> No, I usually sit in the back because I can't stand sitting too close.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.480]   >> Me either.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.360]   >> I can't, I don't understand why they make seats like that because-
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.360]   >> I love them.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.280]   >> I know why they- >> They make it for people like me who show
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   up late.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.160]   >> You know, I was in an IMAX movie, it was the monsters versus aliens the other night.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.160]   >> How was that?
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   >> It was pretty cute, pretty cute.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   >> I loved it.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   >> It was like kid-cute or adult cute?
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   >> No, it was adult cute.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.160]   >> It was adult cute.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.160]   It wasn't Pixar cute.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   >> No, they're not quite there, but they're way better than they used to be.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.160]   >> So who did it?
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.160]   It's not Pixar?
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.160]   >> Dreamworks.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   >> Dreamworks.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.160]   >> Dreamworks is never quite Pixar's.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   >> It's nothing else.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   >> It's like a- >> I don't know how to put a painter on it, but it's-
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.800]   >> Kung Fu Panda got panned by so many movie critics and I loved it.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   >> No, I thought it was great.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   >> It's like what would- >> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   >> I had 20s anymore.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   >> Are you early 30s?
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   God, I feel so- >> We're not-
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.800]   >> That means I must be in like my 70s now.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   >> Well, you're 85.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   >> Oh my God.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   >> But you look great.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   >> Forget about your 80s.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   >> I'm glad you got your eyes done.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   >> I did, I get the little tuck.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   >> He's late 70s.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   >> Late 70s and he's still- >> Who's that?
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   >> William Shatt.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.560]   >> He's mostly bionic now, by the way.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.800]   >> He won a streaming award, didn't you see that?
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   >> Was he there?
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   >> No.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   >> He defeated my friend Brett Rounsville Dan Trekker.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   >> He's pretty used to be a hotel and- >> Did you go to the streaming sprint?
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   >> No, I wanted to, but I had a show in Michigan.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   >> That's kind of- >> So I was in Michigan.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   >> That's like kids in death.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   >> Yeah, I really wanted to, but I had a show in Michigan.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   >> But my point, and I do have one, was that we went to the iMacs theater, we got their
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   lay, we had to sit way up close.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   And although I liked the movie, it was too close.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   >> I was like, and it was three- >> Hold on, iMacs.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.800]   >> I was sort of sick the whole time.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   >> iMacs is the worst for that.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   >> You have to sit in the back.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   >> In the middle, not to the left, not to the right.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   >> Right in the middle, there's one good seat in the whole iMacs theater.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   >> And I'm trying to send all the way in the back row.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   >> I'm just a problem.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   >> Did you have to, I went to see Superman Returns.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   >> Oh, that was such a bad news.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   >> And the bad news on that and iMacs was that they put a little icon on the screen, put
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   the glasses on, you put the glasses on, oh it's 3D's 3D, take the glasses off, okay, take
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   the glasses off, where it's normal.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   >> What?
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   >> During the movie?
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   >> Yes, that is really- >> Why was it only part of the movie in 3D?
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   >> It spoiled the movie because I'm busy thinking, am I supposed to wear the glasses now?
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   >> I had the exact same experience with the Dark Knight.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   I saw the Dark Knight and iMacs and I wish I didn't because the iMacs seems look great,
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   but the moment I'm like, why is it so funny?
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   And I'm like, oh, because it's not iMacs anymore.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   >> I actually went back and saw it in a regular theater because I couldn't follow the plot.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   I was too busy worrying about my glasses.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   >> Oh my god.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   >> This week in iMacs.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   >> You know what, I watched Corline.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   >> I've never in 3D.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   >> Corline would be probably good, right?
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   >> And it was great.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   >> From start to finish is all 3D.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   >> But it was all 3D, yes.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   >> And it was--
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   >> Yeah, you need one or the other.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   >> They can do that with the digital movies, the computer graphics movies because that's just automatic.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   >> Sure.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   >> But it's a big deal I would guess to film a 3D real live action film so they don't do it
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   for the whole movie because Christian Bale scream at you.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   Well, the sort of signature.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   >> You and I were done professionally.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   We're done.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   >> We're done.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.800]   >> I love that.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   >> We're done.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   You're a nice guy.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   That's the best part.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   You're a nice guy, but we're not working.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   We're done professionally.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   >> You know, for 3D you just need to have two cameras like what, less than a foot away
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   from me.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   >> But it's expensive, double, you know, it's probably expensive.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   >> Oh yeah, because the Dark Knight folks certainly didn't have that kind of a budget.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.800]   >> That movie was great though.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   >> It was a great movie.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   I didn't see it in 9/8.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   >> I didn't like as much as Batman Begins.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   >> I agree.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   >> That was so much better.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   >> Why did you like that movie?
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   >> I'm curious, why didn't you like it better than Batman Begins?
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   >> He glad you were good, but that's all.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   >> And I tell you what, Batman Begins pulled an awesome magic trick.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   It was like three quarters of the way movie through, and all of a sudden I realized, wait
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   a minute, wait a minute, this is a comic book movie.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   How did they do that?
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   How did I not realize the whole way long that this is a comic book movie?
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   Dark Knight from the very first scene, I'm like, this is a comic book movie.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   I mean, nothing wrong with comic book movies, but I thought it was such an exemplarie.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   >> It was all action.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   >> And realistic, like if somebody really was going to be the Batman, he was going to be like
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   the last Batman Begins.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   >> I like Batman Begins.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   >> I liked it.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   >> I like it.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   >> I like it.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   >> I like it.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   >> I like the Dark Knight a lot better.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   >> What other movies do you want to talk about?
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   >> Who lets the godfather?
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   >> Completely lost the threat of the god.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   >> Okay, so anyway, Blue is dead.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   Who cares?
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   >> Who cares?
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   >> Digital.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   >> I don't care because I spent a lot of money on watching Blu-ray, and I'm a little bit
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   of a boy.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   >> Save yourself the money.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   >> Did you spend, did you buy a PS3 or did you buy a standalone Blu-ray player?
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   >> I own two PS3s.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   One for here, one for home.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   See, there's one right there.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   I like how crisp it looks on an ice screen, but I have to say it's not worth six bucks.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   Is that weird?
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   Because that's kind of chintzy.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   It's not worth six bucks a month.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   >> Look at it this way.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   I mean, is it worth paying if you use the disc as much as you do?
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   Is it worth paying double every time?
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.480]   >> No, go to FeedFlicks.com and enter in your credentials and you'll see how much Netflix
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.480]   costs.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.200]   Not only that, it tells you how you rank with the rest of it.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.400]   Like I'm like 99% because I don't return movies.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.800]   Sometimes I'll have a movie for six months.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   >> I still have Michael Clayton.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.000]   I've had that disc for six months now.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.200]   >> That's a good movie you should watch it.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.800]   >> Well, I've ordered it.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.200]   >> Great performance from what's his name?
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   >> That guy.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   >> That guy.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   >> George Clooney.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   >> Love him.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   >> George Clooney.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.200]   >> Isn't he great?
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.200]   >> Even guys like George Clooney.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.200]   >> Everyone has a crush on George Clooney.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   >> Even guys.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   Let's not go bromance again because that really hurt my reputation on the net at night.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   >> Oh, I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   The Brodio?
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   >> Wasn't good.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.600]   What are you laughing at, Roger?
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   >> The Brodio.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.400]   >> It's just a funny word.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   >> It is.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   >> I say it when I can't.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   >> It's a ridiculous term.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.400]   >> So you watch Hulu, Roger.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   Let's talk about Hulu.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   Hulu, this is so pathetic.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.200]   Hulu is trying to eliminate piracy, I guess.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.100]   The problem with Hulu is that they've been, boxy will rebroadcast Hulu.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.000]   They want you to go to the webpage, right?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.200]   >> Even though the ads are still there, I don't know why.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.700]   So the reason they want you to go to the webpage.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:03.580]   So they've taken steps to thwart non-traditional browsers, aka boxy, by using JavaScript
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.440]   to encode HTML sent to the browser.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.460]   It's like you could figure out a workaround in this in like three seconds.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.900]   They did in three seconds.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.980]   But it's interesting that they're really trying to keep people from doing the boxy
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.980]   thing.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.780]   They asked boxy not to do it.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.740]   It was hacked within minutes.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.740]   >> Speaking of--
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.220]   >> Is Hulu misguided in trying to eliminate this?
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.620]   >> I've got a theory about this, by the way.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.460]   I mean, and I think it points to a bigger issue, and that's kind of the ad supported
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:44.180]   model that a lot of these services basically base their entire structure on it.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.020]   >> Put the microphone right in front of you.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.140]   >> And whether or not it's something that can continue the way it is, or do they have
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.740]   to actually insert their own spot?
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.260]   >> It's not very many ads.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.380]   I mean, it's just a couple of ads.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.380]   It's not too bad.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.380]   I like Hulu.
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.180]   I watch a lot of Colleen watches Hulu all the time.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.580]   I like watching it on a boxy.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.860]   I don't see what the problem is with me watching on boxy.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.860]   What's your theory, Brian?
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.740]   >> Hulu loves boxy, and they want to make it happen, but they're bowing to pressure
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.940]   by NBC and the old school team.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.940]   >> That's what they say.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.940]   It's the content creators.
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.300]   >> Providers that are forcing them, right?
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:19.500]   So meanwhile, Hulu is winning share every minute that everybody continues to go to Hulu,
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.660]   whether it's on boxy or whatever.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:21.660]   They can--
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.660]   >> They don't care.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.660]   >> They can't get the eyeballs.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.820]   >> So they need to do some lip service to the powers that be.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.780]   So they pay some people to come up with the weakest attempts to move forward.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.060]   >> They're like, "Hey, lip service content protection."
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.740]   >> We're doing, "Hey, we're trying to fight so hard."
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.700]   >> That's what Apple does.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.860]   You could never rip an iPod with its music.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.860]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:48.140]   >> I'm like every idiot can do it, but it's lip service content protection.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.140]   >> I think so.
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.140]   I think so.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:55.680]   I think it is in Hulu's best interest to continue to have boxy plus Hulu be the ultimate set
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.260]   top box solution.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.820]   And if they could drag their feet, then all of a sudden a year from now, they'll have
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.220]   X% of the entire video watching market.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.220]   >> That's what they want.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.020]   They want a good percentage of the market.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.020]   >> Exactly.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.140]   So then they can turn and say, "Hey, can we renegotiate the way we're doing this?
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.240]   This is a little bit ridiculous.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.560]   I think this is all part of Hulu's master plan."
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:17.740]   >> See, I think for an end user, this confuses because I think of Hulu as NBC Fox, but it's
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:18.740]   not, right?
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.740]   >> It's not.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:20.740]   It's totally not.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:21.740]   >> It's like its own business?
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:22.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.200]   >> It's very hard to establish licenses with all these guys, and this is a case where they're
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.880]   having the pinch put on them.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.280]   >> I thought it was NBC.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   >> That's what I thought.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   >> That they started.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.800]   >> They created Hulu and that it was a division.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   >> I could be totally wrong.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.680]   I'm an idiot who gets paid to stick nails in his eyes, but I thought I remembered a
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.320]   Wired article saying about the guy who started Hulu.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   >> No, that makes sense.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.280]   >> And about how hard he wants to establish all these partnerships.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.000]   >> It's always complicated with these relationships to know who's what.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.520]   They probably put money into it, but at the same time--
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.420]   >> Now they could have been an initial investor and then turn around trying to establish
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.140]   control, but I thought Hulu was its own animal.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.480]   >> Well, they're being very clear when they say, oh, it's the content creators that are
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   making us do this.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.080]   I mean, it's clear that they don't want to--
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:06.420]   >> Yeah, Hulu's been pretty straight up that there's a disagreement.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.420]   >> Interesting.
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.860]   We're going to take a break, come back with more and just a bit--
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.240]   somebody sent me a-- or maybe it was in the chat rooms or it was on a forum, but they
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.420]   said, you don't need Teesus through the commercials.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.420]   >> You don't--
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.420]   >> You don't watch them.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.240]   >> Listen, you don't need to Teesus.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.600]   But coming up in just a bit, wire.com is gutted, gutted, and some of my favorite people laid
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   off at the Chronicle.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.680]   I'm very sad about that.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:38.000]   This is a bad-- the usual depressing media roundup of layoffs before we-- I shouldn't
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   do that right now.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.480]   >> Before we do that, here's a fine commercial.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.800]   >> From our sponsor.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.040]   >> We're making money.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.120]   The new media's doing fine, thanks to people like Citrix.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:53.660]   It's really interesting how some advertisers are perfectly happy going, no, no problem.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.020]   We'll go to new media.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:01.300]   And I hate to be kind of the agent of change, but the times are changing.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.540]   Citrix is a really good example.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.340]   Citrix does go to meeting, go to my PC.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.340]   They're a great company.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.340]   I've known them for years.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.820]   I remember hanging out at Comdex.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.460]   That shows you how long I've known them with the founder, Ed Yaquabuchi.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.820]   This has always been a great company.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:18.960]   They do the best remote access stuff with go to my PC.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:25.800]   And go to meeting is their meeting software, a new and better way to meet with clients
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   and colleagues.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.600]   The old way is you get on the phone.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.200]   But the phone meeting, there's always a guy on his BlackBerry answering email.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.200]   He's going, "What?
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.960]   Yes, did you say something?"
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.160]   Or you meet in person, which means you got to travel across the country or you drive
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   across town.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.800]   It's expensive, it takes a lot of time.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.160]   The new way to meet, the way to do it, go to meeting.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.800]   It's like meeting in person, but it's less time consuming.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.480]   It's less expensive.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.080]   And this is to me the big deal.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   It's just more productive.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.080]   It's more engaging.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.680]   It's more fun for everybody, including your clients.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   If you haven't tried, go to meeting.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.460]   I want you to try it.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.460]   We do it all the time.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.080]   We actually do it on some of our shows.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:07.400]   We use go to meeting so that Ray Maxwell can show you screens in Maxwell's house.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   It's very simple.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   He sends it up ahead of time.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.740]   So he sends an email, clicks a link, and then I get an email saying, "Join this go
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.160]   to meeting at 2 o'clock on Wednesday."
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.420]   But you can also do it when you're on the phone.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.840]   By the way, built in free teleconferencing and voiceover IP.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.920]   So it's very easy to use.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.440]   You can already set up the conference and go to meeting and say, "Look, I want to show
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.440]   you the PowerPoint.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.440]   I want to show you these drawings.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440]   I want to show you the website.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.680]   You go to go to meeting.com.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.880]   Suddenly, your client or your colleague, whoever you're doing this meeting with, sees your
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.520]   screen on their computer.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.280]   Real time, just like they're there, they can follow along with you as you move among
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.820]   pages or applications for sales presentations, product demos.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.500]   You can do it for training, for collaboration.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.740]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:53.820]   Here's how you go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.940]   Go to meeting.com/twit30 days absolutely free.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.420]   It'll give you a really good idea of what you can do with this.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.900]   But I do warn you, you're going to try it and you're going to get hooked.
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.900]   It's that good.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.900]   We use it now.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.460]   I have so many go to meeting accounts.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.780]   We use it in so many different ways.
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:15.660]   We just use it go to meeting with Telos to talk about our new mixer system.
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.740]   It's just really, for technical stuff, it's really great.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.180]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.980]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.980]   So now the bad news, kids.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:24.980]   What?
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.220]   Condi Nast laid off a bunch of people.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:31.220]   Now I think, according to a valley wag, an esteemed source.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.620]   Oh, they're never wrong.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:37.360]   An esteemed source, even the Andrew Kehaney got laid off.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.780]   Which is really sad.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:44.900]   It sounds like the print magazine is trying to save itself by killing the digital side.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.940]   Which is, I think, a long way to go.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.700]   Really, really bizarre and backward.
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:49.700]   All right.
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.100]   Well, my question is, how is the digital side doing?
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.500]   Is wired.com as a digital entity?
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.780]   Well, it never does well.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.420]   But that's all we've got, right?
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.420]   Right.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.420]   Well, I mean, what's the future of a print magazine?
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.260]   Well, though, I think the wired, I'm one of the few people I don't--
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.260]   Do you subscribe?
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.260]   I do.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.260]   I do.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.260]   I do.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.260]   It's my favorite magazine.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.260]   See, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.740]   I read wired.com, but I don't subscribe.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.700]   But people love wired the magazine.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.700]   They really do.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:15.700]   You like getting in the mail.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.100]   I love that low contrast print.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.100]   You love the way it looks.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:18.940]   You love the way it's going down.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:19.940]   The white on silver.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:20.940]   Yeah, they do.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.620]   And I think that they're trying to sort of go with that.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:29.220]   There's sort of this love that people have for the print magazine.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.220]   They know they can get it online.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.220]   They don't want that.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.220]   They want the magazine.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.220]   That's interesting.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.420]   Well, and I bet what happens is they sit down there like, look, we got to pick a side.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.220]   We're trying to be winners at two different games.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.100]   We can't play two games simultaneously.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.340]   How we do it in online?
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.580]   We're X number place.
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.580]   How we do an imprint?
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.740]   We're this number place.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.220]   And my guess is they say, what we need to do is we need to specialize.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.860]   We need to focus like a laser and be just one or the other.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.260]   Do you really think that's the future though?
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.300]   I mean, in the long run of a magazine?
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.300]   In the long run, no.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:58.620]   But what happens is magazines, there's still, I think, always going to be a place for magazines
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:05.140]   because you get a depth of story in a magazine that you can't get in a daily websites type
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.140]   scenario.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.180]   And stories on wire.com are more the in depth.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.740]   Did you read about the Diamond Heist story?
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.140]   Yeah, that was a good one.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:16.220]   And that's classic monthly print media journalism right there.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.380]   And so I think it may be the right call.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.380]   I don't know.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.380]   It's a tough one.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.380]   I don't know.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.580]   Maybe they just weren't pulling enough revenue.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:28.500]   Maybe they were hoping that the website could be self-sufficient and they wouldn't have to
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.620]   keep funneling off money from the print side in order to keep it to stay.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.220]   Yeah, I mean, obviously in a perfect world, everybody wants both.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.020]   But I mean, you know, you got to cut and you're wired.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.380]   But you don't have that luxury, really, do you?
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:45.540]   I think they, you know, in the long run, they might have made the more solid choice by leveraging.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.540]   Really?
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.540]   You think so?
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.500]   I mean, if you're looking down three years and whether or not you're going to be solvent
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.100]   in three years, you're going to want to go with the solution that brings you to the past.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.220]   Yeah, imagine you had two futures.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.500]   One where there is only wire.com and one where there is only wire in the magazine.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.420]   Three years from now, if you're going to place a bet, where are you going to place your
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.860]   bet that which one of those will definitely be alive three years from now?
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:09.020]   And I can't say that wire.com would be my first choice.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.180]   As opposed to wire the magazine?
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.540]   I think the wire the magazine will be around three years from now.
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:18.340]   That would be very contrary to the rest of the world where, I mean, print and I mean
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.220]   to cost them printing these things.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.220]   I mean, it's all going away.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.500]   Well, I don't know.
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.860]   I think it's a different branch on the tree of what people want.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.740]   I think there will never be a time that people like, I shouldn't say that when we all have
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.980]   our own portable kindles and we're downloading stuff all the time.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:37.980]   But I think for right now, I get excited about plane flights when I know I have a new wired
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.460]   magazine in my book bag.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.060]   Two people in the chatroom said the same thing just now.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.420]   And why aren't you just launched?
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.420]   To have that physical, I think they probably think-
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.420]   It'll become niche.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:46.900]   It'll become, it's a small-
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.140]   And why not saying that people don't love it?
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.340]   People love newspapers, but they're going out of business.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.700]   I mean, it's not an issue of other people love it.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.260]   It's whether there's a financially viable model.
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.260]   Right.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.260]   Right.
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.940]   But if I were wired, if there was something that you could cut and then build back up,
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.180]   if it made sense later on, online division is it.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:09.540]   But they're not killing the entire online entity.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:13.700]   No, but as you start laying off these people, it becomes harder and harder.
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.700]   It's bad.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.740]   I think they're just keeping operations where they're sustainable and then they're going
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.740]   to build up their-
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:21.740]   They're trying to build their runway is what you're saying.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:22.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.740]   They're going to try to survive.
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.660]   If you're going to survive, you just can't place your-
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:27.980]   I hope that's the case.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:32.220]   I think it's something that they're going to do in order to hunker down and weather the
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.220]   recession.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.220]   Right.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.220]   And then when time is good, they're going to start expanding again.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:40.620]   But I don't think they have the luxury of spending more money than they can afford.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.620]   No, no, no, nobody does.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.260]   I mean, look at the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.860]   I mean, I'm crushed.
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:50.420]   Joel Sullivan, some of my favorite writers from the Chronicle have been laid off.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.620]   This is a company that's losing a million dollars a week.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.620]   So they wanted to-
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.620]   It's so heartbreaking.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:59.180]   I read SF Gate, which is their online division of-
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.180]   Right.
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.180]   That's how I read my Chronicle during the week.
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.980]   Sometimes I get it on the weekend.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.140]   But that's how I've been reading it for the last few years.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.140]   It just kills me.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.140]   I mean, I just-
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.140]   So it's like I'm heartbroken and yet-
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.140]   You're part of the problem.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.140]   And you know what?
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.140]   I don't subscribe to the Chronicle.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.140]   You're right.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.140]   I don't get the-
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.300]   I get it on Saturday if I've got time and I want to sit down and read.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.300]   That's an interesting-
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.500]   I think that goes back to what Brian said.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:24.260]   I mean, in the model, a daily publication against a web model, I think the web would
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.140]   have went out because it's every day you go into-
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.140]   Right.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.140]   How about this?
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:32.300]   R's Technica, 17 people laid off, including David Chartier, who's a great writer.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.500]   I mean, that's a big loss as well.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.500]   Where did-
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:36.500]   Here's my question.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.780]   Now, all of a sudden, you've got all these people laid off.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.140]   You've got these mainstream print guys gone and gals.
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.340]   You've got now these online people gone.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.540]   Where are they going to find jobs?
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.540]   Right.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.500]   I mean, are they going to be working at Denny's?
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.740]   Are they going to be building their flare collection and Applebee's?
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.220]   I think there'll be a lot more, you know, personal blogging.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.220]   And that's a whole nother thing.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.420]   And can that support a person?
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.220]   Can a human being make a living?
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.180]   Believe me, I've tried.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.180]   I don't think-
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.180]   You can't.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.180]   I don't think you can't.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:08.180]   I think it's one of those things where you leverage the knowledge you have and you either
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.460]   do something like immediate consulting or consulting.
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.660]   Yeah, there's the end of the line.
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.580]   I'm a consultant.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:16.580]   But I mean, you know-
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.380]   Who's hiring a consultant?
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:22.420]   Hey, you know, my dad was a structural engineer for like eight years before he got laid off.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.420]   And when he got laid off, he went to real estate.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.020]   Three years in real estate, he bought a restaurant and ran over for five years.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:28.500]   Now he's a seafood guy.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.100]   So it's not unheard of to-
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.420]   No, it's the future, isn't it?
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.420]   Nobody's going to hold a job.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.420]   You have to be flexible.
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   And it's-
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.660]   But that's already kind of come to pass.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.020]   In the industrial age, you had a job, you worked 40 years.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.020]   You got the gold watch.
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.780]   And then you got the pension and you were done.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.260]   But nowadays, I mean, who works a job for 40 years?
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.420]   You do five years one place and then you either jump ship or get laid off.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.420]   Five years is a long time.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.420]   Nowadays, yeah, it's forever.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.420]   I mean, you know, you look at even broadcast.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:54.420]   I mean, I talked to a lot of the shooters who like, you know, now they've picked up-
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.620]   Oh, they're all out of work, aren't they?
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.420]   They're not just pick the ones that are still around.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:58.420]   They've picked up editing.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.420]   They've done a lot of audio.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:04.420]   They've picked up new skills in order to be able to offer a client, you know, you know,
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.420]   an entire turnkey solution instead of-
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.420]   The Predator.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.420]   The what?
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.420]   The Predator.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.420]   The Predator.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:11.420]   What's that?
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.420]   It's the producer, shooter, editor, editor.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.420]   Oh, and the creator of the Predator.
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.420]   I hate that.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.420]   I'm everything, but it's also a living dog.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.420]   As I see them, you're switching cameras, recording.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.420]   Do we all know?
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.420]   I do it all.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.420]   There's no camera operator.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:24.420]   There's no tape operator.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.420]   You should look over at the Predator.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.420]   The Predator and the-
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.420]   I'm the worst kind of Predator.
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.420]   There's no Leo.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.420]   There's just a distortion field where he's not even here.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.420]   I'm down drinking wine.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.420]   That's right.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.420]   I'm here.
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.420]   He's wine.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.420]   Wow.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   That's, you know, that, you know, way that is what we're doing here because I couldn't afford
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:45.420]   to do what Revisions 3 is doing, let alone what, you know, Cron is doing, what Channel 4 is
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.420]   doing.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   I had to do something really cheap.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.220]   So we have lockdown cameras.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.420]   I'm running the whole thing.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.420]   Well, and it works.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.420]   It works.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.420]   It works really well for you, but-
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.420]   Is it going to work for everybody?
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:01.420]   You know, ten years ago, to put this together, there'd be a lot more jobs in this cottage.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.420]   And there's also- Yeah.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   There's also- But there isn't the revenue to support all those jobs.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.420]   Exactly.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.740]   But the audience has changed now, too, to where it's not a detriment to know that you're the
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:14.420]   one changing the cameras and doing the processing and the hands-on stuff.
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.620]   And the questions have shifted, especially with online people, are so used to watching,
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:23.180]   you know, really shaky YouTube cameras and, like, people doing podcasts from their bedroom
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.940]   with a big white wall behind them.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:26.940]   You know, a yellow screen worth fighting on.
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.420]   Is that going to work?
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:34.740]   I mean- But, you know, I think people, as, you know, try things, see what works and go
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.580]   with that, you know, things that don't work, will automatically just kind of bust up by
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:40.580]   themselves.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.580]   I don't know.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:45.940]   So, going through a tremendous change period, not just because of technology, but because
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:49.260]   of economic concerns- It's a complete inflection point.
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:53.260]   Everything is- I mean, if you imagine the shift to the industrial revolution for people
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.260]   who did nothing but work on a farm from- Right.
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:59.860]   --side up till sundown, now you have to be somewhere from these specified hours.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.500]   You have to work for five hours and maybe you can get a lunch for 30 minutes and then
[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:07.980]   you've got to finish out the rest of your day working in this line, pounding the same.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.420]   Well, you guys are dealing with this.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:14.420]   I mean, you've been kind of in this transition, but Sarah and Roger, I mean, you were in mainstream
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.020]   media and now you're in new media.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:17.380]   Roger and I were in college together.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.380]   We majored in broadcasting.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.740]   Oh, that's a San Francisco State or?
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:25.420]   1998 graduated and thought we were going to be broadcast.
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:29.060]   When they taught you in '98, what did they think that the world was going to continue
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.060]   as is?
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.380]   No, oh, definitely not.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.380]   They knew it.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.380]   Even in '98 it was obvious.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.220]   I mean, the tools were for- Yeah, you know, we took a desktop video class because it was-
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.220]   Yeah.
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.220]   CJ Grant's desktop video.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.860]   But that's an interesting question.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.020]   What can you do with somebody- It was Adobe Premiere.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.220]   It was Adobe Premiere 4 on a Mac-
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:50.860]   That was all we had access to and it was like, whoa, this is a pretty cutting edge kind
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:51.860]   of a thing.
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:52.860]   This is the future.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:57.380]   They knew it was the future, certainly, but it wasn't when we got out of school and
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.380]   got a job.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.940]   What they- I was going to say was what they taught you useful?
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:00.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:01.940]   Yes.
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:02.940]   Definitely.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.940]   I took a white flag.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:04.940]   We were ahead of the curve.
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.940]   I took it.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.340]   I took a XML scripting courses.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.460]   They were telling it, you know, you could take a web course, learn how to build a website.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.100]   It seems like that stuff changes so fast that what you would have learned, though, isn't
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.100]   it?
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.340]   I mean, how many people use HTML anymore?
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.340]   No, no, no, it's not.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.340]   It's- But see, that's the thing.
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:24.740]   It's not just the detailed stuff that you learn.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.300]   You understand- It's the concepts.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.300]   It's the concepts.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.100]   It's understanding how things can work together and- Right.
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:36.500]   No, ultimately, you know, it's not- You don't necessarily need to know how to code three
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:41.460]   different languages, Perl, PHP, or C, all at the same time.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:45.820]   But you do know what each of those languages can provide and why you would want it to support.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:48.180]   So I'm kind of thinking about this myself.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:52.500]   I actually have been asked to talk to my daughter's high school about what they should
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:57.180]   be teaching to kids, you know, 15, 16, 17-year-old kids now.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.580]   And one of the things I wonder is, well, is there anything you could teach them from
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:04.860]   a technological point of view that will make any difference in eight years?
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.140]   It's going to- Don't we know it's going to be completely different?
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:15.380]   I think that there is value to them knowing what's going on now so that they can understand
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.180]   when it changes, how it's changed.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:18.180]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:21.980]   Well, it's- I mean, all you can teach is what- Because, I mean, your only alternative
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.420]   is just to not teach them anything.
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.580]   Well, I was thinking maybe you teach them things that you know aren't going to change
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:31.580]   like ethics, like critical thinking, kind of how to write things like that.
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:36.860]   You want to focus on the concepts and the principles because camera technology has changed
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:40.220]   a lot since I left state, but the principles about shooting-
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:41.220]   Yes, you're right.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.220]   All things are shot.
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.220]   Some things don't change.
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:44.220]   It's all this- Three-point lighting.
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.220]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:48.420]   Things why things look good, why things don't look good.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:52.100]   And you know, it's one of the things I think they should really bring back, and I don't
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.380]   think they people kind of laugh at me when I say this is they need to bring back home
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.380]   back.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.340]   I think people- People don't have to cook anymore.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.340]   People don't have to cook.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.340]   Who needs to cook?
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.380]   People don't have to manage for free-
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.380]   I never said come back.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.380]   I never said come back.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.380]   I mean, everyone of it has so- Can you sell?
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:06.380]   No.
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:08.020]   Can you- You darn your socks, Roger?
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.180]   I can't even sell a button.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.380]   I mean, I can sell- See, that's the thing I can sell a button, but it's things like being
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.300]   able to balance your own budget.
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:15.300]   Balancing in check, but would be nice.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.660]   I have to be economic side of a moment.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:22.460]   I've met four-year graduates who still cannot get their heads around like balancing their-
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.580]   See, that's pretty pathetic.
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.180]   You need to be able to balance your checkbook.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.180]   But that's the thing.
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.780]   It's not- But in what class does anyone ever teach you sort of the basics of life?
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:35.780]   Or they teach you how to make enough money so you can- As I have to hire somebody to
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:36.780]   do that.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:41.700]   Or even- But even understand the basics of business, being an entrepreneur, you need
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.900]   to know- I have people to do that.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.900]   How you make money.
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.940]   Well, and I think that's the thing is we've entered the age where everybody needs to think
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.380]   of themselves as an entrepreneur.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.500]   That's what I- Even if you worked on a major company, you need to think of yourselves as
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.100]   a personal services corporation with a staff of exactly one.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.100]   Bingo.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.020]   That's- Actually, as I've been thinking about that, that's exactly what I was going to
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:04.660]   tell this school is teach people entrepreneurship.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:07.020]   It's not like you're going to start your own business, but that's how you-
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.020]   Exactly.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.580]   Self-sufficiency is- Very good.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:11.220]   There's nothing more important.
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:15.860]   Be able to cook for yourself, being able to manage your own finances.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.660]   I mean, people think, you know, ten years ago, twenty years ago, people, well, that's
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.660]   kind of a given.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.540]   There's lots of people who really don't understand that.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:26.460]   They don't understand why they don't have any money at the end of the month when they're
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:29.380]   like blowing fifty bucks on drinks every night.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.780]   But speaking of working for somebody else-
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.780]   Why the credit card got out of control.
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:34.780]   Exactly.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:37.660]   I mean, I think of after all this time credit card debts, you think, well, we all know
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.540]   about it, right?
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.260]   It's a huge, huge problem.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.260]   Gets away from everybody.
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.780]   Well, now it's not a problem because you're- You know, it's over.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:46.780]   Right.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:49.100]   No, you're not getting another credit card.
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.100]   What were you saying, Brian?
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:54.820]   I was just saying, thinking of employee productivity and taking responsibility for yourself.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.740]   That reminds me of another story.
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:57.740]   Yeah.
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:58.740]   About employee productivity.
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:56:59.740]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:00.980]   Involving Facebook and YouTube.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:04.420]   Oh, I saw, you know, it's funny to say that.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.420]   Go ahead.
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.420]   Tell us about it.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.420]   Oh, well, just that there's a study that says-
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:09.420]   Look, you've become the Devorak show.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.420]   I think that's great, Brian.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:11.420]   I'm here with a mission.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.420]   Keep us on track.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:14.980]   You know, Brian, we talked about this on Twiff on Friday.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:15.980]   I guess you weren't watching.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:16.980]   Oh, did you go on?
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:17.980]   No, no, no, no.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:18.980]   I missed that as well.
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:19.980]   And I was in the room.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.340]   Well, then you're uniquely qualified to comment on it.
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:27.620]   The study says that Facebook and YouTube at work make people better employees.
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.620]   What's the story there?
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.660]   How could that possibly be?
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:35.100]   The whole idea is that it's very- This is not a new concept.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.860]   The concept is employees need breaks.
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:39.300]   They need to mentally get away from their work.
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.300]   I need a break right now.
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.300]   That's right from all this wine.
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.300]   That's right.
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.300]   This is hard.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.300]   I need a break.
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.300]   This is hard work.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.700]   But, you know, the point is that people, you know, productivity will go down if people
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.780]   are worked to death.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.820]   And so Facebook is an escape.
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:57.140]   You know, it's a chance to hang out with friends, you know, in a virtual sense.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.580]   YouTube is a place to watch a video.
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.860]   Watch people get hit between the likes.
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:02.140]   A dog running around in circles.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:03.140]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.140]   Yeah, or people eating hot.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.460]   So you're just saying they need a better break room.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:10.940]   And that's- Basically, the study is that people, they get something out of taking breaks.
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:14.820]   And, you know, they're choosing to take breaks online, sitting at their desk rather than-
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.780]   Can we ask them to listen to podcasts and watch the live?
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:18.780]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:19.780]   I would like-
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.780]   This week at Fun is an excellent break for me.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.260]   A 90 minute break for everywhere.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.260]   There you go.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.260]   There you go.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.740]   Do you know what this made me think of the moment I read this?
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.740]   Have you read-
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:28.740]   Fire Eating?
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.740]   Dan Arrele's book, Predictably Arration.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.740]   You love that book.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:32.740]   Isn't that a great book?
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:38.020]   One of the things he talks about in there is the difference between market norms and
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.300]   social norms.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.380]   And he talks about the way this seems like the other side of the coin.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:46.620]   A lot of businesses are asking people to take personal responsibility and apply social
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.900]   norms and say, "Hey, we're a family here.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:52.700]   I understand that you're off work right now, but if you could use your blackberry to check
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:56.940]   in on this one problem that we have, since we're all family, would you mind doing that?"
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:00.540]   The flip side is, if you're going to start using social norms to get people to work in
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:04.740]   their off hours, the flip side is you've got to keep social norms during the nine to
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:08.700]   five times and allow people to act as socially people.
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:13.060]   In other words, you can't just use it when they're on their off hours and then turn off
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:15.460]   that kind of social dynamic-
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.460]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:23.500]   I actually agree with that because when you can build that bond, I think people will automatically
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:26.980]   be more conscientious about things.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.380]   Like, "Oh, I better send that to him.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:30.740]   I know I'm on vacation, but he really needs to know.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.580]   I better send it out right away."
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.100]   They're building credit in their personal bank.
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:39.060]   The more that you allow people to act like an adult while they're in the cubicle, the
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:43.380]   more that you can expect them to act like an adult and be part of the family while they're
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:44.380]   off at the beach.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.380]   Instead of chattel.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.380]   Well, instead of-
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:48.380]   Cattle.
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.380]   Instead of, you know-
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.380]   I like it.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.380]   You are my chattel.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:58.460]   Well, if you're in a position where you're okay, they're just looking at me as a worker
[00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:04.500]   be a drone from nine to five and screw it after I get off, that's my time.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:10.100]   Whatever work has with me, I'll deal with that tomorrow.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:15.260]   There was another good thing in that book, predictably irrational, where they asked-
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.260]   What was it?
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.260]   They asked doctors.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.820]   First, they were going to pay doctors to do something, right?
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.820]   No, it was lawyers.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.740]   They said, "Hey, the elderly need legal services.
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:29.900]   Would you mind providing legal services for only $40 per session?"
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.420]   And all the lawyers was like, "Screw you, 40 bucks?
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.420]   What?
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.420]   Yeah, I don't do that."
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.820]   Then they set out the exact same set of lawyers.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.620]   They're like, "Listen, elderly people need lawyers.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:38.900]   Would you mind doing it for free?"
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.900]   For free.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:40.900]   Yes, of course we will.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:41.900]   Robono.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.220]   We love the elderly.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.220]   So what was the-
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.220]   What was the rational-
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.220]   The rational-
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.660]   The point is the moment you involve money, monetary interaction, all of a sudden we have
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.860]   different rules that we apply socially.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:57.620]   For example, and the example they gave is if you sit down to Thanksgiving with your grandmother
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.860]   and at the end of the evening you're like, "That was really good.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.780]   Can I give you something for this grandma about 40 bucks?"
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:02.780]   Oh, that'd be insulting.
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:03.780]   That'd be so insulting.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.780]   Yeah, that'd be so insulting.
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.780]   Exactly, exactly.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:11.020]   We have different sets of rules for social norms versus business norms, financial norms.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.340]   So it's kind of along the same lines.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.940]   Yeah, that's actually a great book.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:18.820]   I want to recommend it as our Audible book actually this week because it is on Audible.com.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:19.820]   That's where I read it.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.820]   I really loved it.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.340]   Dan Ariele, predictably irrational.
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.420]   The hidden forces that shape our decisions- You can get this for free, by the way.
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.140]   In fact, I'm going to set it up so you get two books for free.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.740]   If you go to Audible.com/twit2, the number two, that's where you sign up for the platinum
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.740]   plan.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:41.220]   It gives you two books a month, which is what I do because I need two books a month.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:44.460]   You know, it's funny, I don't commute anymore, but I listen at the gym.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.860]   You know, I am a crazy audiobook nut.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.860]   Do you like them?
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.500]   Well, because not only do I drive because I'm doing these shows all over the United States,
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.500]   so it's like I'm driving and then I have to get through security and then I have to wait
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.140]   for my flight and I'm on the flight.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:57.060]   It's like there's always time.
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.060]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.140]   And I love doing two things at the same time.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:03.180]   If I'm doing housework, I love just tuning in to an audiobook and doing the dishes.
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.340]   Well, are you a member of Audible?
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:05.340]   I am.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.820]   I was going to say you should really join here.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.220]   In fact, I wanted to plug my favorite audiobook reader.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.220]   What's that?
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.220]   Do you go by readers?
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.220]   I do.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.220]   Will you read this just based on who he is?
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.220]   He's your favorite reader.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.420]   He's passed away recently by his name is Frank Mueller.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.420]   You knew exactly that.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.420]   Oh, yes.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.420]   Who did you say he passed away?
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.420]   He's phenomenal.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:26.580]   And in fact, I was heartbroken when he got in that motorcycle accident and lost his ability
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.740]   to read and in fact, they set up the Wave Dancer Foundation.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:35.180]   I will read anything that's been read by Frank Mueller, which specifically, that's what
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.900]   got me into Stephen King's The Dark Tower Series.
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.540]   The Gunslinger, have you read those?
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.540]   Yes.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.540]   He's phenomenal.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:45.540]   In fact, Stephen King said that his voice are the voices in his head as he writes the
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.540]   Dark Tower Series.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.540]   Let me play.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.020]   This is from the Shawshank Redemption.
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.020]   Oh, so good.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.020]   So good.
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:52.020]   Yes, it really was.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.540]   I mean, if you can, if you can.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.260]   Trump Morgan Freeman, then I'm on board.
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.260]   He sounds like Morgan Freeman.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:57.260]   Kind of does.
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.460]   This is, yeah, this is a Frank Mueller reading a little bit from the Shawshank Redemption.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:04.060]   Thousands of other items from men doing time here and some of them perfectly legal.
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.260]   It's really, really hard to come by in a place where you've supposedly been brought
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.220]   to be punished.
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:13.740]   There was one fella who was in for raping a little girl and exposing himself to dozens
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.740]   of others.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.580]   I got him three pieces of people.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.580]   That's a good thing.
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.580]   That's a good thing.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.980]   Welcome to raping a little girl.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:27.460]   He's doing a kind of a character voice there, but he is such a good reader.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:28.460]   He's got a great voice.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.020]   And a wide variety as well.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.100]   Like in the Dark Tower series, you hear him.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.340]   There are four primary characters.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:38.780]   You hear him do a grizzled Clint Eastwood gun slinger.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.260]   You hear him do a 12 year old boy.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.260]   I didn't sound right.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.260]   You hear him.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.700]   Don't do a 12 year old boy.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:48.300]   You hear him do a southern black woman and a kid from New York.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.300]   It's phenomenal.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.300]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.300]   Frank Mueller.
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.740]   Well, that's what's interesting about Audible is that you do, it's a performance.
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.460]   It's not just somebody reading a book to you.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.540]   It's a performance and Frank is one of the, was one of the greats.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.860]   Can I ask a maybe stupid question?
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:04.220]   How does a man like Frank Mueller become an, a book?
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.620]   Usually they're an actors.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:10.180]   And people recognize that he's got a voice that would be great for an audio book.
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.060]   What it really is, I think it's a job for out of work actors or actors in between jobs
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.220]   and audibles in near New York City.
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.660]   So they have studio nine studios.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:18.660]   I've actually recorded a book.
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.620]   And they say, would you perhaps consider reading the Stephen King series?
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.540]   And so a lot of people make living doing this.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.940]   I think it sounds like a great job.
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:25.940]   This is fun.
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:26.940]   Yes.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.500]   And Frank Miller would do cool tricks where he would actually, you could tell they're
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.300]   doing a little bit, not, not enough for you to really notice, but a little bit of digital
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.620]   chicanery where he would interrupt himself.
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.380]   Like when a character interrupts themselves in the book, they would make sure to edit
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.380]   it that way.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.380]   Sure, yeah.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.380]   It was phenomenal.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.660]   I think, I think there would be no better compliment than for someone to say, I love that book,
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.660]   The Shawshank Redemption.
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.500]   Sarah Lane was the best reader.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.500]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.500]   I mean, that would be really awesome.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500]   But the sound really awesome.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:55.340]   So when he does the other characters, do you, is that like, I guess everything's written
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:56.940]   on the script form and then they read it.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:57.940]   He reads it from the book.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.180]   Some people, it's interesting when somebody like Jim Dale who does the Harry Potter books
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.140]   in the States has a, has a lot of character voices.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:08.340]   He actually records the voices and when he gets to that character, he'll listen back
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.300]   to the tape and say, oh yeah, that's the voice and do the voice.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.420]   So everybody sounds really different.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.180]   And then some readers don't sound so different.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.180]   And that's fine too.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:21.660]   In fact, Steven Fry, who reads the British version of Harry Potter doesn't do quite such
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.140]   a dramatic difference between characters.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.380]   And it's just a matter of taste.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.380]   It is.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:27.900]   It's really interesting to hear different people do it.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.900]   It's a performance.
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.100]   These guys are actors or gals or actors.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:31.100]   I mean, they're really, really.
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.500]   What's tough is to go from when you're reading a series and somebody else does it.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.820]   And you're like, you're saying the names wrong.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.820]   What are you doing?
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:38.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.940]   Drives you, do you find yourself like, yeah, she awhile to get back to you?
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.460]   Let me ask you this, Brian.
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.460]   I don't know.
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:48.260]   Then maybe this is just me, but when I'm listening to a book, if I go back, I can remember where
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:50.260]   I was when I heard that part of the book.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.260]   There's some sort of weird memory link.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.580]   You'll take of something like, like I'll, I'll read a book or I'll hear a phrase that
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.580]   would be like Nebraska.
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:56.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.580]   I'm writing across Nebraska.
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.580]   That's like a song.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:04.340]   There'll be a song that all the first time I heard it or a certain moment on the radio
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.820]   where I was going, you know, certain curve and sub-astiple.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.180]   And I always think of that.
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.180]   That curve.
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:11.180]   That curve every time I hear it.
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.180]   Okay.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.180]   So you do that with books.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.180]   I do that with books.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.180]   I never done it with songs and never get it for me.
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:20.340]   It'll come to a moment in time and it's not even a very significant moment.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.340]   No, no, no, no.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.100]   It's just, it's just, it's like a deja vu thing.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.100]   Isn't that weird?
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.540]   You people often say that about songs and it never did it for me, but books it deaf.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:27.540]   And it really does.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.540]   Let's make our pick this week predictably irrational.
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.620]   The hidden forces that shape our decisions.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.980]   Dan Ariely, but because it's platinum, you get two.
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:38.980]   So which one is the best, Frank Mueller you think?
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:39.980]   Oh, man.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.540]   If you're, you really need to do the dark tower series.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:44.980]   A lot of people, it's the only series as far as I know that Stephen King did.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:48.980]   And, and if you've read it, you know that all his other books are secretly about the
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:49.980]   dark tower.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.980]   Isn't that wild?
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:51.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:52.980]   I guess that's true.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:53.980]   Because there's all these weird little cross-rovers.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:54.980]   You're absolutely right.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:55.980]   And I've fun about that one.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:56.980]   There we go.
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:57.980]   Two great audible picks.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.780]   You join audible right now audible.com/twit2.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.660]   We thank him so much for their support.
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:06.980]   And by the way, Colleen, you know, she does this twit picks thing.
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:07.980]   She's so great.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.980]   I love Colleen.
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:12.100]   So she picks something she listens to the shows and she hears something and she's made
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.340]   predictably irrational or twit pick.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:15.700]   So you can follow twit picks on Twitter.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:20.740]   It's twit picks, twit.com/twit picks or go to twit.tv/picks and we'll make that our,
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:23.420]   our pick of the day, every day a new pick from Colleen.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.100]   She's, she's so funny.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.180]   She just, she just picks whatever gets her, gets her going.
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.540]   She just loves that.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:31.940]   Moving right along here.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.780]   I think we're almost coming to the end of the show.
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.460]   Oh, oh, this is a sad one.
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.300]   And I want everybody to take a moment.
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.820]   Grab a glass of romp wine.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:41.820]   Grab a glass of wine, everybody.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:42.820]   I've got my C.
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.820]   Is this a solemn one?
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.060]   We don't have to pour our wine out, do we?
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.060]   solemn occasion.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.060]   No.
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.060]   The end.
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.060]   I'm out to our throat.
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.060]   Like, yeah, right.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.060]   The end of Encarta.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.060]   Oh my gosh.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.060]   The end of Encarta.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:55.580]   Anyway, this to me is Blu-ray story part two.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.580]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:57.580]   It's the exact same story.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.580]   It's the same thing.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.580]   It is.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:02.140]   I have to say, I haven't used Encarta in a long.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.140]   No one has.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:04.140]   I've never used it.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.140]   That's why.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.900]   I, I, back in the day, back way back in the day, we're talking.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:09.900]   I don't know.
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:10.900]   Everybody got it free.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:11.900]   93.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:13.900]   No, no, wasn't that far ago?
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:14.900]   Was that maybe it was?
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:15.900]   Maybe it was.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:16.900]   Yeah, yeah, because I was still.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:16.900]   That was when C.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.900]   Roms were huge.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.900]   Right.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:19.900]   And how old were you 12?
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:20.900]   No, well, I was a little older.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.900]   You were pretty.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.900]   You were 16.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.900]   Like 15.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.300]   But I mean, I love, I thought it was the best thing in the world.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.300]   I would look up.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.940]   So you were of an age where you would have used it in school?
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:31.940]   Yes.
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:33.940]   And in fact, I did.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:34.940]   I did.
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:36.340]   I used some outdated cardisities in college.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.340]   Look over here.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.900]   I have every, I have the world book encyclopedia.
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:43.540]   What's the last time you pulled one of those out?
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:44.540]   Well, I bought it for the kids.
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:47.140]   I thought when I was a kid, I used, I read the encyclopedia.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.340]   I loved reading the encyclopedia.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.340]   And you know what?
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:52.860]   And then you realize that, especially when you go do research based on the, the, the
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:56.140]   Christopher High School, you go through five different psychopedias, you realize none
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.740]   of them has all the, they're all crap.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:08:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.780]   But Wikipedia is so much better.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:07.180]   But look at what in card, what kept in card alive was that it brought rich media.
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:11.100]   I brought the video files and stuff in a time when the bandwidth of the internet was not
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.260]   sufficient to do that.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:16.260]   There was a kind of like Blu-ray right now.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:20.900]   You know what, Brian, you, I think you really have touched on an absolute analogy.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:25.460]   The card going away is basically 10 years from now, we're going to have that half the
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.460]   time.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.460]   Here's to now.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.460]   Here's to Blu-ray.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.460]   Remember Blu-ray?
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.460]   Let's do it now.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.460]   Let's get over because we got the wine.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.660]   We're out of the liquor for our dead homies.
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:36.980]   Are you saying Larry Ellison was right about the whole, what did he say?
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.900]   Net computing or cloud can be, I remember.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:39.900]   Well, I think he is.
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:40.900]   So that's, that's where we're all.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.500]   We talked about this last week, but I didn't ask you guys, what do you think of this on
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:49.780]   live thing that they announced at the game developers conference and it's from Steve
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:53.340]   Perlman, the guy who did web TV, it's gaming in the cloud.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:58.420]   I, the conceptually, I think, you know, it could work if you had enough bandwidth.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.700]   The problem is you're going to have enough bandwidth.
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.700]   I think people don't have enough bandwidth.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.700]   Not after the cap.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:03.700]   This is so, so.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.260]   Well, here's my, here, you want my conspiracy theory?
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:11.260]   Yeah, they're doing the cap unless you buy this special gaming package.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.260]   Oh.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:16.140]   And that's, I think part of the reason you're seeing all of this, not just gaming premium
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.820]   services, but especially online.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:21.100]   But I think online is going to need a couple of more years of work.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.100]   Here's what I think.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:26.580]   I think Steve Perlman's already made the deal with Comcast and Verizon and they've said,
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:30.060]   maybe time Warner, you, you do give us quality service.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.500]   You prioritize our packets.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:35.540]   You can charge 15 bucks a month extra on your cable bill and people will be able to play
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.820]   on live better than they would be able to if they did.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.740]   So, so net neutrality is now official.
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.660]   Net neutrality is dead because of online.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.660]   I'll tell you, man, I've been infected by some games and it's like there are times I
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.860]   would easily pay 50 bucks extra for prioritize packets.
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:51.300]   If I could know that I had the big thing, I bingo that competitive nature.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.860]   The thing is now you don't pay 60 bucks for the game anymore.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:55.580]   You're paying 15 bucks a month.
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.140]   You get all the games you want.
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:00.260]   It's great for a casual gamer, but serious gamers are going to say, well, this is pretty
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.420]   cool.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:03.300]   If if and that's a big if Roger.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.420]   It's a big if if it works.
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:10.260]   I mean, the thing is you're essentially allowing a remote server to, to process the game.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:13.700]   So as soon as you do a little, you know, control action, you have to wait for that,
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.820]   you know, it's you think it's not going to happen?
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.340]   I don't think it's going to happen for another couple of years.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.300]   By taking the meantime, they think it's going to happen this fall.
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.100]   I they're very optimistic.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.100]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:28.180]   From everything I've read about everyone's experience with it, it's going to need a couple
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.180]   of years of tweaking.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:33.380]   Now, if you want an example of what they're doing right in video games, you use steam,
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.380]   don't you?
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.380]   Yes.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.380]   Steam's a non-submarine.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.380]   It is brilliant.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.140]   It is so funny to watch Valve beat Microsoft at their own game.
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.140]   Brilliant.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.660]   They took the exact model that made Xbox live.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:43.660]   King of the console.
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:46.260]   Everybody beat Microsoft at their own game, ultimately.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.260]   No, no, no, no.
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.780]   But see, there's a difference.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:53.180]   Microsoft's model on gaming has always been selling you the media.
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.180]   Right.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:58.940]   Steam was basically removing the entire distribution model and then just storing it online, which
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:11:59.940]   makes sense.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.060]   But they were the ones to foster the community to where now you're sitting there, you're
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:06.980]   doing a word processing document, and then your buddy hops on hops on left for dead and
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.620]   you're like, well, hell, I want to be a zombie with it.
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:14.300]   Steam actually, I mean, there were instances of that before, but Steam actually successfully
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:19.340]   married that aspect along with the download sales aspect of the games.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:23.660]   What's amazing is they're also releasing all of their sales data or not some other sales
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.700]   data based on like these weird sales that they'll do.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.620]   Like they'll just, the game will come out in a month later out of nowhere.
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.020]   They'll say, next three days, this game's 20 bucks.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:34.300]   You know, that's been a huge success for them too.
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:38.180]   They've made, you know, they'll cut the price in half and they'll sell 10 times more,
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:39.180]   three times more.
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.180]   Crazy, 300 times more.
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.220]   So it's really been, I mean, I wait for the sales now, don't you?
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.220]   Totally.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.980]   And what's exciting too is like take a game like Team Fortress 2 where they've released
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:51.780]   it, it's been out forever, but they release tracking information that shows they'll come
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.780]   out with an update.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.940]   They'll just randomly add another map, they'll update a character and all of a sudden the
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:57.180]   sales go through the roof again.
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.180]   This is a brilliant model.
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.180]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:01.780]   Well, the best thing about Steam is it's portable.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.780]   Right.
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:03.780]   I have it here.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.780]   I have it at home.
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.780]   It doesn't matter.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:06.780]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.780]   You can play it on any machine that you want.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:08.780]   You're not limited.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:09.780]   And that's kind of a thing.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.780]   I don't play games here, Colin.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.460]   I don't play games.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:16.660]   My brother came over and I had Steam both on my laptop and my desktop and he was able
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.020]   just to log in and because I had already downloaded all the same games he had, he was
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:24.100]   able to just type in his name and start playing his account on my computer.
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.100]   It was phenomenal.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.100]   Great.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:30.940]   No, it's, it makes, that's ideally what the video gaming industry should look like.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:34.580]   I think the current issue is you basically have these vertical, vertically integrated
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:40.660]   markets between Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo and you know, it's very, it's a very high
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:44.620]   barrier of entry for people who want to develop games and sell them.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.620]   It's, I don't know.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:50.900]   That's my favorite thing about Steam is how they're making the sub $20 games economically
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:51.900]   viable.
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.900]   Like world of goo, you've played world of goo, haven't you?
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:54.900]   Love world of goo.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:55.900]   It's phenomenal.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:58.500]   And I just started, somebody got me infected with a defense grid, the awakening.
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.500]   Oh, what's that?
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.500]   I've seen that.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:01.500]   It's phenomenal.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.180]   Is it like a real time strategy?
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:05.580]   They call it a tower defense game.
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.580]   Yeah, it's a tower defense game.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:10.080]   If you like tower defense games, it just scratches that itch.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.080]   What's it called?
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.080]   Defense grid, the awakening.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.780]   Oh, you're going to love steam.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.780]   You're going to love it.
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.780]   It's on steam.
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:16.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.780]   It's probably 10 bucks, right?
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:18.780]   It's like, I think it's 19 when I bought it, but I mean, who knows?
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.900]   I'll maybe a sale any minute now.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.900]   Defense grid awakening.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:22.900]   The awakening.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.900]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.100]   You know, this is, it's interesting.
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:29.580]   Is this a model that others could, is it just games or what they're doing just games right
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.580]   now?
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:32.500]   There are other people who are hopping on it as well.
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.900]   Hardock has a product called Impulse, which is essentially a carbon copy.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:40.500]   Well, they had one before and then they overhauled it to be a little more.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.180]   But it's just gaming.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:45.380]   It's games, but I think they're, Stardock also writes their own software.
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.620]   So it's not hard to see that they're going to start integrating.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.620]   Impulse is not bad though.
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.620]   I liked, I played the political machine.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.620]   That was a lot of fun.
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:55.220]   The bigger issue though is like, do you, I see two models emerging.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:58.860]   One is subscription based where you have game tap where you pay a monthly fee, you get
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.420]   access to everything.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:03.980]   It's a steam where you pay for the whole game and you can play it indefinitely.
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.180]   You just have to be online.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.860]   And I'll tell you, I think steam is going to be the winner there because I love knowing
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.300]   that I don't have to touch a disc.
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.500]   I love knowing that I'll never use a code.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.660]   If you, who cares if there's anybody else?
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.660]   We've got steam.
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:16.660]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:20.980]   I think if game tap actually really works on getting enough AAA titles, I don't see it
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:24.540]   not having, if you have both members, memberships to both.
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.540]   I used to.
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.620]   Now I just have steam because I own the game, right?
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.620]   So.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.620]   Plus steam's free.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:30.620]   You can sign it, you buy the game.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.620]   Well that's a good product.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:33.620]   Take time off.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:36.980]   I guess if everybody did it for free, then you'd have accounts everywhere and you just
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.340]   get the game that you want and then you don't even have to care anymore.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:43.660]   But if you have some like game tap where you ideally would, you pay, you pay your monthly
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:48.420]   fee, you get, you get access to the entire inventory of games that they have whenever
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:49.420]   you want.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.100]   It's just, it's like, it's basically a cable.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.900]   You pay, you pay your fee and then you can play when you want.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:58.460]   Now I tell you what, there was a time that steam was so good, I assumed, okay, digital
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.540]   just reaching, that's where it's at from now on.
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:03.180]   And I made the mistake of buying Spore over there direct down.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.580]   I'm a crappy game that was.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.940]   I'm so sad about Spore.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:10.140]   Well, the game itself was, was, was, was the download experience was miserable.
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.140]   I still have.
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.140]   Best because of the copy protection.
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:13.140]   Yes.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:14.740]   Because it's because it was an EA product.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.460]   It broke my computer.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.380]   EA tried to do their own digital download services.
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:20.380]   Terrible.
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:21.380]   It was just horrible.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:22.380]   It was wonky.
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.860]   It was cluji and the user experience was horrible.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:29.260]   I had to, I had to reformat my laptop because it was, it did such a poor job and it got
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:31.900]   mixed up and every time I booted up it would just freeze.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:36.180]   I just want to point out this is why gamers never get late.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:39.180]   Because Sarah Lane is like, she's turned off.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.180]   She's turned off.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.180]   She's turned off.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.180]   She's turned off.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.180]   I couldn't be more.
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.180]   I love the jewelry.
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.180]   Where's the model that I do left?
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.180]   You know, it's funny.
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:50.620]   There are a few people in the chat room who are like, notice Sarah was talking.
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.580]   And I was like, well, I'm reading you guys.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:53.980]   I was like, actually, you know what?
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   I'm not that interested.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:55.980]   Couldn't bear less.
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:58.180]   Is there any game you play at all?
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.180]   Honestly, right now.
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.180]   The game of life.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.500]   I mean, there's a few like silly iPhone games that I played.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:10.420]   But honestly, I'm much more sort of entrenched in sort of the web app social network.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.780]   You've played peggle, haven't you?
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:13.780]   Surely you love peggle.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:14.780]   Paggle's a good game.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.940]   No, dude, it's like crack for the brain.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:17.940]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:18.940]   Paggle's a good game.
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:19.940]   You haven't played crap.
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:20.940]   You haven't played crap.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.940]   I haven't played crap.
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:22.940]   No, I don't.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.940]   I don't think so.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:24.940]   But Scibulous is gone, right?
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:25.940]   But they've replaced it with...
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.940]   Yeah, but I used to play that, you know, two other...
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.940]   If you have the game, yes, absolutely.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:31.940]   You like Scrabble, because you're in an electoral.
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:32.940]   You like the word thing.
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:33.940]   I'm a...
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:34.940]   There's a lot of, you know, there's like...
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:35.940]   Highly evolved humans.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:36.940]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.700]   I used to have one of their flash games.
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.700]   It was a word jumbled game where you had to come out with the words as the letters were
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:42.700]   taken.
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.500]   Molly Wood likes a word.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:45.500]   She plays wordle nonstop.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.500]   It's kind of similar.
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.500]   And it's, you know...
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.500]   Scrabble.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.500]   And that's a thing you think is...
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.500]   No, it's...
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.500]   You know, when people think games are thinking FPS or thinking...
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.500]   You need the...
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.140]   I get the stupidest magazine.
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.540]   I don't know why they put me on this list called the Casual Gamers Association Magazine.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.540]   Oh, that's hilarious.
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:03.100]   It's like people who only eat cooked sushi.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:04.100]   This just ends.
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:05.540]   People like bright colors.
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.580]   Ooh, Solitaire!
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.180]   The next generation.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.820]   It's like it's so sad.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.060]   3D Solitaire, finally.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.060]   Yeah, it's like shuffleboard, basically.
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.060]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:17.060]   Yeah.
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:19.140]   I know, I think there are a lot of games that are really fun.
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:21.740]   I mean, the word game, I mean, that's a very...
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.340]   It's a very broad term.
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:26.060]   Well, there are certain games I like, certain games I don't.
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.380]   I think I just happen to be one of those people who doesn't like...
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:29.380]   You're not a gamer.
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:30.380]   There's plenty of women gamers.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.220]   We've had gamers in here all of them.
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:33.220]   My mom is...
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.220]   Like, first person shooters make me nauseous.
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:36.060]   Yeah, because of the head movement, head-bop.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.060]   Yeah, it's just...
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.060]   I don't know.
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.060]   I've never been able to actually...
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.060]   I actually think...
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.300]   I actually think like my mom may actually spend more hours playing games than I do.
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.300]   What game says?
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.300]   Well, she plays these...
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.740]   A niche I didn't even know existed.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.420]   Like, the mystery find and hunt the clue games.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:50.420]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:51.420]   You know what I'm talking about, right?
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.980]   Basically, these are pop cap games where...
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:54.980]   Pop cap's very smart.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:55.980]   You remember how...
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:57.220]   It's like it wears wall, though.
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.900]   You have to find out all these clues...
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:18:59.900]   Oh, I can't wait.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:00.900]   ...in a giant jumbled image.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.900]   Yeah, I like that stuff.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:02.900]   Yeah, you would love it.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.900]   You would love it.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:05.900]   You would feel really smart when you finally take it out.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.900]   I'm the scissors.
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:07.900]   I'm amazing.
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:09.900]   Remember highlights magazine for kids?
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:10.900]   Yes.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:11.900]   In the back they would find all the...
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:12.900]   See, a highlight.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:13.900]   See, a highlight.
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:14.900]   At the orthodontist office.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.340]   It's the exact same thing.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.140]   I would own those highlights magazine.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.140]   It is so pathetic.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:24.140]   You guys are a bunch of losers.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.140]   Not you, Mom.
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.140]   It's okay.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.260]   If you're a mom, it's fine.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:30.060]   But you guys, come on.
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:31.060]   Find the scissors.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.060]   Would you please zoom in?
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.060]   Would you basically nail them?
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.980]   We were 11 years old, Leo.
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.700]   Oh, you're not doing it now?
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.700]   Highlights, no.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:38.700]   I haven't picked up highlights in quite a while.
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:39.700]   I don't even know if they exist anymore.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.180]   Remember Goofus and Gallant?
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.180]   Yes.
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.300]   One of those guys could never get his act together.
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.500]   No, Goofus was a cool one.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.260]   No, Gallant was a cool one.
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:51.980]   No, he's being just telling a joke.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:53.180]   He's acting like...
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:56.740]   I'm sorry, I missed the highlights for children inside humor.
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:57.740]   Yes.
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:58.900]   Well, it's eyebrow.
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.020]   This might be a good time to end the show.
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:02.020]   I want...
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.020]   You can all have more wine, though.
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:08.100]   I want to thank Brian Brushwood for actually being here.
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.100]   You are fantastic.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:10.580]   Will you please come back on to what we can do?
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:11.580]   We love to.
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.980]   Like, from Nebraska or anywhere you are.
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:16.380]   Can I point out what is significant about this episode?
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:17.380]   What is?
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.380]   We've never said the T-word.
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.700]   I know, and we're not going to say it now, so don't you say it.
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.500]   Can I just say an at-word?
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.060]   Yeah, what's your at-word?
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.500]   @shwood, S-H-W-O-O-D.
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.460]   This is also the name of your website?
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:29.460]   Shwood.com.
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:32.220]   That's the last six letters of my name.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.220]   Brian Brushwood.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.420]   Forget the Brian Brush.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.900]   I just remember the Shwood.
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:36.900]   Yeah.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:37.900]   Where are you supposed to eat fire?
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.860]   I'm going to eat fire after the show.
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:40.860]   Brian's going to...
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.700]   This will be a bonus extra for those of you watching the video live.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.700]   I'm going to eat fire.
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:47.700]   Thank you for reminding him.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:50.580]   I'm sort of quietly waiting for Leo to eat fire.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.340]   Oh, I'm not looking forward to this.
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:53.340]   He's toasty enough.
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.340]   I'll do it.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.340]   I am not looking for it.
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.420]   I am toasty enough, that's for sure.
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:58.420]   @shwood.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.420]   @shwood.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:00.420]   Thank you, Brian.
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.420]   I'm going to start.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:02.420]   I have not been following you, so I'm going to start following you.
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.420]   Roger Nank again following me because I de-ended me earlier.
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:06.620]   Roger Nank doesn't follow me either.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.340]   I follow Jack and we train.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.340]   50 people.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:14.140]   He is Jolly Roger as long as we're talking @sines.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.140]   No T-words.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:16.140]   Still I'm not said the T-word.
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.140]   This is awesome.
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:18.140]   That's @sines.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:19.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.740]   Roger is also the producer of Techzilla.
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:21.740]   Techzilla.com.
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:22.740]   T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.740]   Or revision3.com/techzilla.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:26.860]   Now why would you do that?
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:28.620]   Because it's just Techzilla.com works.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.380]   Yeah, Techzilla.com, but for some reason I--
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.380]   Either one.
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:36.980]   Either one, but I instinctively always type revision3.com/techzilla.
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:37.980]   Why would you do that?
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.380]   You've got Techzilla.com.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.060]   We didn't have the screensavers.com.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.060]   We couldn't have that.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.580]   No, no, we didn't have call for help.
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.780]   It was that guy in Colorado with a roofing business.
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:48.780]   Yeah.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.780]   Had it and wouldn't sell it.
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:50.780]   There's a guy who has twit.com too.
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.780]   That's why I registered Scam School.tv.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:55.460]   It's because I didn't want to have to say so many syllables.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:56.460]   Is that where you go?
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.700]   Scam School.tv forwards right to revision3.com/scam School.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.700]   Scam School, great, great program.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:01.860]   I mean you have a book too.
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.540]   I should plug your book.
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:06.140]   It's called Cheats, Cons, Swindles and Tricks.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:11.300]   57 Ways to Scam a Free Drink by Mr. Brian Brushwood.
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.180]   And where can you get this, Brian?
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.180]   Just email me.
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.180]   At schwood.com.
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.180]   At schwood.com.
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:17.180]   Schwood.
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:18.180]   I love saying it.
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.740]   It is fun to say, isn't it?
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:20.740]   Schwood.
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:24.180]   The Siemens Gallery in Modesto.
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:25.180]   Fisherman's Gallery.
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:28.780]   Break place to go to get all of your fish needs.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:29.780]   The Siemens Gallery.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:30.780]   Sorry.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:32.780]   It's really bad, Shout-in.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:33.780]   Fisherman's Gallery.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:34.780]   Thank you.
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:35.780]   Rogers Family.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:36.780]   Ah, of course.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.780]   Of course.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.780]   It's not called the Siemens Gallery.
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:46.780]   What's called the Siemens?
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:46.780]   Sarah Lane is a wonderful human being and you can find her at our brand new podcast on the
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:48.980]   Twit Network Twift this weekend fun.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:53.060]   Isn't that fun just to be able to plug me as one of the other podcasts on the Twit?
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.060]   Couldn't make me happier.
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.060]   I could be on the--
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:57.060]   Sarah Lane Soundboard right there.
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:58.060]   What?
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.060]   That I'm part of the--
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:00.060]   No.
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.060]   What did I say?
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:02.060]   Isn't that fun to plug me?
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.060]   Oh.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.060]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.060]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.060]   That's--
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.700]   But we're making a list of these.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:08.700]   I know.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:09.700]   He's writing it.
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.700]   He actually might come in handy later.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:11.700]   Blackmail.
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:12.700]   Blackmail.
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:13.700]   It's a good one.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.540]   I thank you all for joining us to remind you.
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:19.060]   By the way, thanks to Garyswine.com for the beverages today.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.060]   That was pretty good.
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:23.860]   By the way, Gary's-- he was in the chat room and he seemed really happy with everything
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:27.380]   and he says he'll send us-- he'll send us bunk wine if we want it.
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:28.380]   What's bunk wine?
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:29.380]   Bad wine.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:30.380]   So that we can complain.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:32.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:33.380]   Because we couldn't complain today.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:34.740]   By the way, we got the story on Dan Hachroyd in there as well.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:35.740]   What's happened-- what happened to Dan?
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.780]   I said that he was at his daughter or something or other, really wanted to make it happen.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.780]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:41.260]   We'll get Dan on another time.
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:42.260]   That's fine.
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.260]   But you know what?
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.260]   I'm happy.
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:45.260]   I got Brian Brushwood.
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.260]   I got Roger Chang and I got Sarah Wayne.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.260]   I couldn't do much better than that.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.260]   I thank you all for being here.
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:50.780]   A reminder, you can get this show every week automatically delivered.
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:51.780]   It's an amazing thing.
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:53.140]   It's called a podcast.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:57.060]   If you go to iTunes and search for Twit, you'll find it and a bunch of other great shows.
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:59.700]   Twitpicks are on that T-place.
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:04.180]   If you go to @Twitpicks, you could file it and Colleen's been working very hard to give
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:08.100]   us some great stuff or go to twit.tv/picksumly on LaPort.
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:09.100]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.100]   Another Twit.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:11.100]   This is amazing.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.100]   Goodbye.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.100]   He's in the can.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:14.100]   Goodbye.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.100]   Goodbye.
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:29.700]   Let's take a moment for a BSA about G-force.
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:33.980]   Something that I think troubles all of us here.
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:38.980]   It's important that we hear Twit recognize the importance of recognizing the danger of
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.980]   G-force.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:43.140]   Tell me why I say that.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.980]   People talk about surviving a crash.
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:48.420]   It's the fact that you were going 70 miles an hour and had a stop suddenly and your guts
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:49.420]   kept going.
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:54.580]   More importantly, your brain sitting in this bath of cerebrospinal fluid just knocks right
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:55.580]   up there.
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:56.580]   Exactly.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:57.580]   Ouch.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:04.580]   I'm going to do it.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:12.580]   I'm going to do it.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:17.580]   I'm going to do it.
