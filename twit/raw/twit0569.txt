[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260]   I'm gonna pick somebody from the studio audience
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260]   and get to ignite this rocket.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260]   Underneath the studio?
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260]   No, I've been told under no cert.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.260]   The kid.
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260]   How many fingers yet?
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.260]   You got them all?
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.260]   You're good to go then.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.260]   You still have them all?
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.260]   As long as you can...
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.260]   You can't stop you.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.260]   You're totally fine.
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.260]   We got a great panel today.
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260]   Alex Wilhelm is here from Mattermark, right?
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.260]   Yes.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.260]   I got it right.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.260]   You nailed it this time.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.260]   I'm so impressed by you.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.260]   Mattermark, he is an EIC.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.260]   Indeed.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260]   That is ego in charge.
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.260]   Sure, we'll take that.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.260]   It's close enough.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.260]   @Alex.
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.260]   On Twitter.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.260]   On Twitter, he got...
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260]   Yes, no, that sounds like a mistake.
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260]   You couldn't possibly be @Alex, but yes you are.
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.260]   I'm also @AlexWillHulm1 on Instagram with all the world's awesome news and names.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260]   So, just form one line.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260]   That's an AOL username.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.260]   I joined late.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.260]   I'm not cool.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260]   So, I was very behind on the whole Instagram phenomena.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260]   How come the other Alex Wilhelm didn't get one?
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.260]   Is he zero?
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260]   No, he just got Alex Wilhelm no number.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.260]   No number.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.260]   I had to add a little kick of the ink, so I'm not very...
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.260]   Not with it.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260]   From Engadget, Robert Tobaldwin.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260]   I always say Robert Tobaldwin.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.260]   Robert Tobaldwin, he's senior editor in gadget.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260]   S-T-R-N-G-W-Y-S on the Twitter.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260]   I say that because if I say strange ways, they might want to spell it out.
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.260]   That's true.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.260]   Yeah, it's an old, old...
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.260]   It's me.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.260]   That I got.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.260]   Yes, mis-reference.
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260]   Back in the AOL days, I got it.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.260]   Really?
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.260]   We only have eight characters.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260]   That's the reason why it doesn't have all the letters.
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.260]   The vowels.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.260]   Oh, wow, nice.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.260]   I just kept it because I'm lazy.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.260]   That is very sweet.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.100]   Also here for the last time before he heads off to parts unknown, Mike Elgin, our digital
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.100]   Nomad.
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.100]   From Elgin.com.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.740]   And what is it?
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.740]   Nomadic Life?
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.580]   It's called Becoming Nomad.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.580]   Coming Home.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.220]   Yeah, that is a site that will one day be the site for the book that I'm working on.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.220]   We've had such trouble.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.220]   I have to apologize.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.780]   Getting you on, I just can't apologize too.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.540]   I've dialed in with some really rotten connections.
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.700]   I feel like Jeff Jarvis.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.060]   I mean, it's just bad.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.260]   I feel like Jeff Jarvis.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260]   He's been in the next city and other places.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.340]   Jeff, it doesn't matter where he is.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.980]   There's something he breaks Skype.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.660]   There's something about him.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.500]   But you do a good, a valiant effort.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   You're going off to France.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   That's right.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.500]   That's right.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   That's right.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.500]   And then back to France.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   Wow, that sounds good.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.300]   You know, I just saw that you can get land in New Zealand cheap.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.340]   And they even throw in a sheep or two.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.340]   That's a great deal.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.100]   Okay, I looked up New Zealand and now I found New Zealand record cocaine seizure in
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.820]   horses head.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.660]   That is not what I was looking for.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.660]   Sounds like a nice place.
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.260]   This is the most family friendly episode I've ever been on.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.340]   New Zealand town with too many jobs.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.580]   They have too many jobs.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.580]   That's the problem.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.700]   Offering packages of land and homes in New Zealand, $365,000.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.460]   And they say the unemployment for teens in this town is two.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.460]   Not 2%.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.460]   But two.
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.460]   Just two individuals.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.460]   Two kids.
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.460]   Two kids.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.460]   You've written the article.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.780]   So literally unemployment is two among the youth.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.260]   I want to go find the two people that are like, I just will not work.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.260]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.020]   You're going to import people to do the job that I won't do down the street from around
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.020]   the world.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.020]   They're probably in a band.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.460]   I was going to make a League of Legends joke.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.020]   I was going to have a prim to be that.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.020]   Hey, that's a job.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.020]   That's a full-time gig.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.540]   For like nine people playing Twitch.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.220]   So what made me interested about this is last week when Jason Calicanis was on, I asked
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.260]   him, what do you and your other, you know, multi-millionaire ilk?
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.700]   Where is your hidey hole?
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.620]   Where are you going to go if it all goes to hell?
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.180]   And he says New Zealand.
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.220]   But you don't need to be a millionaire anymore.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.540]   If you have $165,000, you can go.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.500]   I even, I actually, after I read this article, tell me if you did this too, Alex.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.620]   I went and looked up the immigration requirements for New Zealand.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.620]   Did you?
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.140]   So no, there's an update when I read the story at the very bottom from like the, like the
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.540]   mayor of the town or something.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.540]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.380]   He was like, look this up first before you apply to make sure you're eligible for immigration
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.380]   to the area.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.900]   I don't know if it's in the diversion you have.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.900]   It is.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.900]   Very impressive.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.900]   So I read the announcement.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.260]   I went and I looked up and if you're an entrepreneur, if you want to, so if I wanted
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.020]   to bring Twit, the business to New Zealand, all I have to do is invest $100,000.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.540]   I'm spending five times that to build a new studio in town.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.460]   And then I could have a three-year residency.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.100]   And if at the end of that residency, I want to become a full citizen I could.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.100]   So I'm moving to New Zealand.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.460]   I just want to announce that.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.100]   You want to come, John?
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.100]   Carsten Burke.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.100]   Okay, that's all I need.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.100]   I got the three people.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.460]   I'm like, take us out by boat for in-studio appearances or like, what's the plan for them?
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.660]   You can hire those teenagers.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.060]   Well, there's two more.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.060]   The two teenagers.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.460]   You know what I actually thought about that?
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.460]   I wonder if they can edit video.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.460]   Probably not.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.460]   They can be unpaid interns.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.900]   They probably have medical cards though, I'm sure.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.100]   Can they put out seats for our non-existent studio audience who won't be there because
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.700]   not only is this in New Zealand, but this is the remotest coast on the south of New
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.700]   Zealand.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.900]   What's the surfing like?
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.420]   It's actually the southeastern corner of the excellent.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.420]   Surfing is excellent.
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.420]   Is it?
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.020]   No, they specifically mentioned that.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.620]   Okay, so here's the user.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.620]   You're the surfer?
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.460]   Yeah, I'm out.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.420]   My wife is a British citizen.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.420]   Does that help?
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.420]   Doesn't.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.420]   Damn it.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.740]   So we've even made a kind of emotional video.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.020]   What kind of bandwidth can you get?
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.020]   That's the big...
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.500]   I don't know why they're mentioning Australia.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.500]   Zealand.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.940]   Okay, I looked that up too.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.340]   So there are two undersea cables to New Zealand.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.700]   There's a TAS cable which comes from Australia.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.700]   Not very many.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.700]   But there's a very good one that comes from California to New Zealand.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.700]   Really?
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.580]   The DSL, the ADSL2, and other high-speed connections they have fiber.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.580]   Okay.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.580]   And I think there's sufficient bandwidth.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.860]   I don't know if there's sufficient bandwidth to this particular island.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.860]   But I think there's sufficient bandwidth.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.140]   You know who moved to New Zealand, of course, is in Australia.
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.140]   Yeah, right.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.140]   I love it.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.140]   He loves it.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.140]   He lives in Queenstown.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.140]   What?
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.420]   What's the laughing about the two unemployed young people?
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.420]   Two.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.420]   They're still unemployed.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.420]   He just checked.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.420]   Two.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.860]   And they're known for being unemployed by purpose, for on purpose.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.420]   And for ashamed parents.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.340]   What I find interesting is that you, not only did you read this article, but I see now it
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.180]   is the most popular article that's ever since been chronicled.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.180]   Ironically.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.180]   Covering that local island.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.180]   Do you think there's going to be this mass excellence?
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.660]   There was a farcical t-shirt on.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.660]   We come out every day.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.660]   I'm our brand for Ellen Tom's Day.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.660]   Oh, I get it.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.660]   It's a little pride joke.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.660]   It's come out every day.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.660]   That's good.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.860]   All right, now we're going to cover the tech news.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.860]   Oh, right.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.860]   I know.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.860]   It's not interesting.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.100]   I'm a tech anglers, of course, which is the digital nomad lifestyle, which I have become
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.100]   a big evangelist.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.100]   You inspire me.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.220]   You don't have to stay in New Zealand.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.260]   You could live in New Zealand for a while and then go to Australia for a while and then
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.260]   you can go to wherever.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.260]   You move around.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.260]   I moved around.
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.620]   I lived for a month in Cuba.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.460]   I lived for a couple of months in Mexico.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.460]   So you're a writer.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.260]   So there's a difference because writing you can do anywhere.
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.860]   You don't even need very fast internet.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.860]   You just upload.
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.860]   Right.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.020]   If you went to videos a problem, it's expensive.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.700]   What you do here is very, very difficult.
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.780]   Well, I could go back to audio.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.780]   I could do audio.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.980]   Do you think I could do audio podcasting for anywhere in the way?
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.460]   You know, I can't do as live streaming.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.780]   I could do I could record it and upload it.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.420]   I might take a day or two to do it.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.020]   Anyway, believe me, I'm thinking about it.
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.460]   Only because it just feels like we're going to hell in a hand basket here.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.460]   I don't know why.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.460]   Is that me?
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.340]   I'm not taking the headphone jack out of the iPhone.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.340]   That will not stand.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.060]   I mean, it feels like it's all over.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.060]   It's all over.
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.860]   The flop and drives are going to stay around.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.700]   And this is the funny thing.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.860]   Business Insider had an article saying how much innovation it's going to stimulate when
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.460]   they take the headphone jack out of the iPhone.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.300]   I just vomited them out of mouth.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.300]   Innovation.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.300]   Whoa.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   Innovation.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   You'll see the CES 2017.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   I was sorry.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.740]   Innovation is going to happen anyway.
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.820]   Because the Doppler here won.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.940]   Oh my god.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.940]   It's not finished yet.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.340]   But like the Doppler in like three or four years, this thing.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.820]   Which is the thing that aims at you?
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.820]   Right.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.060]   No, this is the thing you open up the app and you're like, I don't want to hear the baby
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.420]   crying and then silence the baby remotely.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.820]   You can like silence sirens.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.420]   You can turn up this, turn down that.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.700]   You can tailor exactly what you hear and the new one.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.100]   You can stream your music and make phone calls and do all the things you can do with a regular
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.100]   ear.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.100]   It's like fantastic.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.180]   It's 300 bucks, unfortunately.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.180]   But this is where-
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.180]   Wait a much.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.180]   You're like six thousand dollars.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.180]   Well, that's right.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.180]   This is a replacement.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.020]   These kinds of, this category of hearable, they don't like that term, but I like it hearable.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.540]   There's several multi-core processors in each earbud.
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.540]   This is really sophisticated audio technology.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.940]   And I think it's all going in that direction.
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.940]   It'll get cheaper.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.940]   It'll get smaller.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.420]   The battery life is the new wearable, isn't it?
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.420]   Yes.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.420]   And so it's like, this is what I want.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.980]   I want to never take them out.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.380]   I want to hear only what I want to hear.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.340]   Kind of like, you know, political opinions, whatever.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.340]   Whatever.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.340]   I only, I want my own filter bubble.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.340]   You can't, you can't.
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.340]   No, you're out.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.340]   You cannot.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.340]   Not yet.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.340]   Not yet.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:06.340]   Wait till after there's all this kick-
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.340]   That would be a desirable plug-in.
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.340]   I don't want to hear anything about the election.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.340]   But six months.
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.980]   That would be a plug-in.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.980]   But exactly.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.260]   But this ships by the end of the year, and it's fantastic.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260]   And then there are a few others, this matter.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.540]   Well, you say it's fantastic.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.540]   Have you used it?
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.540]   No.
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.540]   No, I have-
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.540]   So in principle-
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.860]   In principle, their previous product was impressive in multiple ways.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.260]   There are a few things about this product.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.260]   They're kind of parlor tricks.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.380]   You can have the Darth Vader voice and all kind of stuff, which is dumb.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.060]   Everybody else sounds like Darth Vader.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.380]   Whatever you can, they sound like anything you want.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.380]   I don't like that aspect of it.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.380]   But I love it.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.380]   I love it.
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.380]   So you know the concept-
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.380]   You think so, Roberta?
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.380]   Dumb?
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.380]   Would that be-
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.380]   Engagit has spoken.
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.380]   How about it?
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.380]   What do we do?
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.380]   I don't know.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.380]   Everybody's voice.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.380]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.380]   Everybody's kind of like them.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.380]   Do you get a little something million-
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.380]   The Enterprise market.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.380]   The Pervy Grandpa from The Simpsons.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.380]   Oh, well, my sh*t.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.380]   Everybody is up.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.380]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.380]   You'd be like friends with that or-
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.220]   Family guy.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.980]   Is that who he's from?
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:01.980]   Yes.
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.980]   Okay.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.460]   Smart noise filters is really intriguing.
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.460]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.460]   The problem-
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.780]   You know, it's easy for the bows and other noise-canceling headphones to work with jet
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.580]   noise because it's a consistent sound, a consistent frequency.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.780]   They don't work well at all with voice or anything else.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.980]   So I'd be very curious how smart these smart noise filters are.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.180]   I guess an airplane engine is not so hard, but office chatter?
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.380]   Can you really block that out?
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.380]   You can.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.380]   These things work.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.060]   They work like noise cancellation where it is.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.500]   They essentially take in the noise and then they-
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.500]   Face it.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.500]   -- oppose it.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.060]   And they do the same thing on the fly with specific frequencies.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.740]   So they don't have a generic, for example, a baby filter.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.340]   There's one everybody likes who's- we've all been on those airplanes.
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.180]   It doesn't generically filter out.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:51.340]   It listens for and identifies exactly what that specific baby is doing and where it's
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.340]   doing it.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.900]   So the filtering in each earbud is different based on the location of the baby and stuff
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.900]   like that.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.900]   It's pretty sophisticated.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.220]   And the only reason I'm a little skeptical is because remember the broggy dash, which
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.340]   was the kickstarter for Bluetooth headphones.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.340]   Also $300.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.980]   Yeah, and they did a lot more except that when you got them, they didn't do much.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.140]   Everybody I know who ordered them has put them in.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.100]   Battery life on all these products is terrible.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.100]   Terrible.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.300]   Three hours, four hours max.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.140]   But I'm excited about the future of that.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.700]   I really think that having a lot of processing power in your ears and wearing those things
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.420]   all the time is going to be pretty great in some unexpected ways.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.020]   It is not, however, why Apple is removing the headphones from the headphones.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.020]   No, it is not.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.020]   No, it is not.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.020]   Will they do that, Roberto?
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.660]   You work at Engadget.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.580]   You have to deal with this in some way.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.580]   I mean, they might.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.580]   Who knows?
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.580]   It's Apple.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.580]   And the thing is that people keep bringing it up.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.580]   Well, you know what, we have all these ports on our computers.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.740]   Well, the audio jack is essentially a computer port.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.740]   It's an audio jack.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.380]   It's a jack that's used by millions of products.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:55.380]   Everything from sound boards to tape players to everything uses that audio jack.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.420]   And then to remove that, you're basically giving the middle finger to an entire industry
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.220]   that's been set up for, I don't even know how long I'll do it.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.260]   Are you familiar with Apple?
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.420]   The middle finger to the entire industry is what they do.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:14.180]   But you're also giving the middle finger to millions of users because if I get a phone
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.500]   and I'm paying $20 a month, I can afford that.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.700]   I'm not making a lot of money, but I want a smartphone.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.700]   Everyone has a smartphone.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.700]   How do you get your jobs?
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.660]   Everyone's computer for the most part.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.660]   These mobile phones.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.620]   And they say, "Okay, here's your computer that you can buy from us."
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.860]   But all the things that you've been using since you were born to listen to music, you
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.260]   can't use those anymore.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.980]   We want you to use whatever insane beats headphones we have.
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.860]   And then we'll give it to maybe some third parties, we'll license it, and then give
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.460]   some control over who, what will work and what will not work.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.220]   If the next iPhone doesn't, none of them have audio jack.
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.460]   I'm not buying an iPhone anymore.
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.460]   I think that's fair.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.460]   And I do.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.460]   And that's a real thing.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.460]   Damn it.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.460]   I'm in a band.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.180]   I use that audio jack for a lot of stuff.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.180]   I use it to record.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.180]   Well, you're a musician.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.180]   There you go.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.180]   There you go.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.180]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.180]   And yeah, it's ridiculous.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.820]   And if they're doing it, they've already done it.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.180]   If they're not doing it, then yeah.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.020]   But watch, because I don't think, was it Buzzfeed or Business Week?
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.620]   It might even have been Business Week.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.780]   The storyline that this is innovation, that's what Apple's going to say.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.660]   We're innovating by taking out that phone chat.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.740]   The deletion of some formats of storage and data transmission is good over time.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.260]   We kept all the ports we've ever had over the history of the computers.
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.540]   This was a Gruber said.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.100]   He got rid of the floppy drive.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.100]   That's not the same.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.900]   But I don't think it's the same thing.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.140]   It's totally not the same thing.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.140]   Delevinging floppy drives was the same thing.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.260]   That was a very good move in the iMac.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.260]   But this is different.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.380]   I was even like, oh, you got rid of 30-pin port and we have a smaller port that's reversible.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.940]   Yeah, totally fine with that.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.940]   Well, that's the main reason.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.940]   Because it's the main reason.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.580]   It's still using USB, getting rid of serial ports, can roll.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.580]   Great.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.580]   I totally understand it.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.860]   The audio port is not a computer port.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.260]   It's a universal port.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.820]   That's why they want to get rid of it.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.820]   They can't control it.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.820]   Exactly.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.180]   More than that, they can't sell you license to use.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.220]   They also can't fully waterproof the iPhone.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.220]   Oh, that would be a good reason.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.580]   Yeah, I think- Wait a minute.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.700]   My Samsung Galaxy has them in his waterproof.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   It has their head phone chat.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.700]   Sony has their phone chat.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.700]   Yeah, and it doesn't even have-
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.700]   It just makes it easier.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.340]   It simplifies the phone, really.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.340]   They want to be thinner.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.340]   They want to do all this Apple-y stuff that people-
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.340]   No, but that's another thing.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.340]   They don't need a thinner phone.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.900]   I need more battery life.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.900]   I don't need a thinner phone.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.900]   Make it thicker.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.900]   Give me more battery life.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.900]   This has been enough.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.900]   This is definitely-
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.900]   How much more space do you need to go to this?
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.300]   Well, the funny thing is people, Apple doesn't fire.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.740]   They want a more battery life.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.340]   They put- No, I want more-
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.140]   By the way, you guys are all three of you using iPhones.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.340]   I'm using iPhone as soon as they go to-
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.340]   I'm like, well, I'm using an iPhone.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.340]   It's just the last iPhone.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.340]   Looks just like the iPhone.
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.340]   That's fine.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.340]   It's a rectangle.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.340]   There's all your iPhones.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.780]   I like my 2007 vintage iOS.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.780]   Oh, that's sweet.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.780]   You're using-
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.780]   No, it just doesn't change since 2007.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.780]   That is true.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.780]   By the way, I don't know if Apple said this, but I think that it will-
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:02.620]   This will be the 10th anniversary iPhone because the iPhone was announced January 2007.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.620]   Sounds right.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.380]   It shipped in June 2007.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.020]   So it's not going to be the iPhone that comes out in 2017 because that'll be nine months
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.020]   later.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.440]   It will be the one they announced in September for October release.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.040]   That will be the 10th anniversary iPhone.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.040]   It will be like the 20th anniversary Mac.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.040]   No one has-
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.800]   Yeah, I have one over there.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   No value.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   Has not kept its value well.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.140]   Didn't give it value when it's sold.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.340]   Apple is in a little tiff right now with Spotify.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.420]   I'm actually interested in where you guys come down on this.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.300]   I think there's two reasonable points of view.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:41.000]   Spotify started the battle by complaining that Apple- they sent a letter to Apple's
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.500]   legal counsel saying that Apple is rejecting an update that Spotify has had waiting to
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:53.140]   be released in the iOS store causing "grave harm" to users by doing so.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.460]   The letter says Apple and they released it publicly, of course.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.220]   Apple won't approve the new version because Spotify doesn't use the company's billing
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.940]   method for in-app purchases and subscription services.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:11.240]   Apple did say that, well, Apple's response to this is, "Well, we've always treated you
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.240]   this way.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.320]   This is nothing new.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.920]   We've always said that in fact Spotify charges three bucks a month if you buy it through
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.680]   Apple, which is actually kind of maddening.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.200]   So in fact, Spotify will tell you, and one of the things Apple doesn't like will tell
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.320]   you, don't subscribe here.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:34.200]   Well, Apple's response, and I'm paraphrasing, I assure you, is that we abuse everybody in
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.200]   exactly the same way.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.700]   So why are you complaining about that?
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.340]   Yes, so we've always abused you this way.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:45.660]   In a nutshell, they charge a 30-something percent premium for anybody who's selling stuff, but
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.660]   they don't charge themselves, and if they did it would be ridiculous, obviously.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.500]   So everybody has a disadvantage against Apple, and they're right.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.660]   I think what Spotify is doing, they're trying to force the issue into the public conversation
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.220]   because it really is unfair.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.220]   Especially for subscriptions.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.180]   Like in apps that just says, "Oh my God, I can understand it."
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.700]   But for subscription, the in-app purchase, okay, it's being stored on whatever random
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.620]   server Apple's going to use in Google, who cares.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.460]   But for subscriptions, like an ongoing payment system, it doesn't seem fair, but everyone
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.060]   bought into it.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.900]   And now they're like, "Well, you bought into it before."
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.820]   Well, they said the terms when there wasn't really an app store or app ecosystem in place,
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:29.020]   and so they could invent the rules that were the common methods that everyone could follow
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.020]   on.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.940]   So I'm like, "Well, I'm going to buy into Spotify, saying how much money will I pay over these
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.940]   millions of users every month?
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.940]   That's just not reasonable."
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.980]   And I, given that Apple has more money, I land on Spotify's eggs.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.340]   I like smaller business than bigger.
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.660]   Well, this is the problem.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:46.980]   Spotify gets more than half of its customers through the app store, which means both cost
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.820]   the money, and they can't say goodbye to Apple.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.180]   This is a big part of their business.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.100]   Well, that's why I charge 13.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.140]   So they're still getting there like 10 bucks.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.100]   Well, this is what cost it.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.540]   A Spotify launched a promotion.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.260]   The second time they've done it, they said, "If you're new, get three months of service
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.220]   for a buck, but you can only get it if you sign up on the web."
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.900]   And Apple threatened, apparently, threatened to pull the app unless Spotify stopped pushing
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.900]   the deal for iPhone owners.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.060]   This is from Billy Steel's Engadget article.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.540]   Spotify compliant, but also nixed the iTunes billing option in the iOS version that they
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:27.260]   currently stalled, they took it out, and Apple says, "Well, you can't do that either."
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.260]   So it's about 100--
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.260]   That's what Amazon did, though, for a long time.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.420]   And I think still does.
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.940]   You can't buy a book in the Kindle app.
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.460]   You have to go to the Kindle store on the web.
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.460]   Right, right.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.460]   Same thing with Amazon streaming.
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.900]   You can't buy movies within it because they'd have to give a 30% vig to the Apple folks.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.900]   Yeah, yeah, you have to go to the book.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.060]   Like I find a book in the Kindle app, and I'm like, "Oh."
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.740]   Is Apple going to ban the Kindle app in the Amazon streaming?
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.740]   I mean, that may be part of the reason you don't have Amazon streaming on Apple TV.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.100]   How do you put it in a wish list?
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.100]   Yeah, right.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.580]   And then later you go on to your Amazon account on any other device in the world and you buy
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.580]   it.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.180]   The reason this is for the complaint now, of course, is that Apple has a competing service.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.900]   So it's even more in the interest to slow Spotify down a little bit.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.900]   Yep.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.900]   And they haven't been super successful against Spotify.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.900]   Right.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:19.540]   You know, Apple has dominated music since the early 2000s, and they just don't like it.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.540]   They don't like it, Leo.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:26.780]   They don't like another company sort of like doing a lot better on subscriptions and paid
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.620]   subscriptions than they are able to do.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:36.620]   Of course, they could buy a certain music service to get two, what is it, two million
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.620]   more users?
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.620]   Apple.
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.620]   Apple.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.620]   Apple.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.620]   The title's always been a bit...
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.620]   Well, they just...
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.540]   They usually just wait Spotify will go out of business in about five to ten years.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.540]   I think that's the truth, is that...
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.940]   If they just like, "Oh, no, let's just wait until they realize they're never going to
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.940]   make any money."
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.740]   And then that's what happens with Google, Apple, and Amazon are going to be the only
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.500]   people with these services because they can afford it because...
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.500]   They don't have to make money.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.420]   It's secondary to the hardware or the other services that they're selling.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.420]   Apple says the current app actually violates our rules.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.500]   It already violates our rules.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.820]   We find it troubling.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.260]   This is a letter from Apple's General Counsel Bruce C.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.580]   Well, we find it troubling that you are asking for exemptions to the rules.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.340]   We apply to all developers and are publicly resorting to rumors and half-truths about
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.340]   our service.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.340]   Do you think these guys will come to the table in the case of the day?
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.100]   Can you read that again in English accent, please?
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.100]   We find it troubling.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.100]   There we go.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.100]   Why English?
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.100]   The German's better.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.100]   I was not...
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.100]   The German should be shabby.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.100]   How about...
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.100]   No, I think it's more like...
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.340]   We find it troubling that you are asking for extensions to the rules.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.340]   We apply to all developers.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.340]   Bruce C.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.340]   He just went up against the government.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.340]   He's like, "Pfft, Spotify."
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.340]   If I could beat the FBI, you ain't got nothing on me.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.340]   What are they, Swedish?
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.340]   Come on.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.340]   I could take down the DOJ.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   What kind of name is X?
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.340]   Eh.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.340]   I don't know.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.340]   I'm just saying.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.340]   I don't know how Bruce...
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.340]   But to Mike's point, Spotify has 30 million subscribers.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.340]   Apple Music has 15 million.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.540]   And so it's only a two-
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.340]   But Apple's coming on strong.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.340]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.340]   It's doing a very good job to capitalize on their built-in install base on the iPhone.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.340]   And using that to leverage quick growth in the market.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.780]   And I would guess that behind the scenes, the other thing that's going on here is how do
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.340]   you quickly kill the other guys as you make the music industry squeeze them?
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:29.260]   And Apple, really what Apple wants to do is use Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre, their good connections
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:34.340]   with the music industry, Taylor Swift and others, to get the music industry to squeeze
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.340]   these other guys.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.340]   Right.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:42.580]   And behind the scenes, Bruce is also writing a note to Warner Records saying it would be
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.340]   very convenient for us.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.940]   No, they don't need to do that.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.940]   They just make nice to the music industry.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.940]   They become one of us.
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:55.940]   I think that's what the title, well the rumor title deal is is trying to make nice little
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:01.940]   because title is the one that has all those people signed up because it's Jay Z's company.
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.380]   But it's easy to make nice with the music industry when you're Apple because you don't
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.500]   have to pay Apple a 30% premium.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   You can charge less and still make it more profitable for the music industry.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   They don't have to be operating on zero margins.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.060]   And is that fair?
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:24.180]   I mean, it doesn't violate antitrust law to the best of my knowledge, but is that fair?
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.580]   If Google tried it, it would be unfair because they don't make everything.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.780]   Which I mean, let's face it, the music industry, it's run by three companies, right?
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:38.020]   All of whom charge exactly the same price?
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.020]   Right.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.500]   Just a coincidence.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.740]   Total coincidence.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:49.380]   I mean, collusion is illegal, but clearly these companies, you know, collude tacitly if
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.020]   not explicitly with each other.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.420]   With the music industry?
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.420]   What?
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.420]   The inventors appeal.
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.420]   No, they wouldn't.
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.420]   That's a...
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.420]   They couldn't.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.420]   You're talking crazy.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.060]   They'd never do that.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.780]   By the way, if they buy titles, they buy title, they will not get Prince's music.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.780]   Oh, they won't?
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.780]   Then what's the point?
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.780]   That was like my whole thing.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.460]   I was like, oh, I'll take my title because he's not around to say your name.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.940]   This is speculation.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.300]   They may get the life of Pablo, but will they get Prince?
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.180]   It's not even a good record.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.180]   Is that a good record?
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.180]   No, it's not a good record.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.180]   They get lemonade.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.620]   Lemonade's a good record.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.620]   But they're lemonade...
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.860]   Well, it's on the music store.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:28.860]   Right.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.100]   It tells it, but you can't stream it.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:37.140]   Prince, according to someone in the know, I don't know, it would be a matter of whether
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.780]   the contract said that Prince's estate would have to approve any license assignment or not.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.300]   I imagine it would because that's a standard clause.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.940]   According to a music executive, Apple would probably have to negotiate a new deal with
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.940]   Prince's estate.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.940]   In other words, Prince would not go along.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.420]   In fact, what Steve Gordon...
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.500]   Actually, he's an entertainment lawyer and the author of the Future of the Music Business
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.740]   is being quoted here in The Ringer.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.820]   They're not acquiring titles, rights to play music.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.140]   They're acquiring titles subscriber list.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.340]   That's all.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.340]   And they're not...
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.340]   You know what?
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.340]   What they're really acquiring?
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.340]   Jay-Z's Goodwill.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.340]   Period.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.340]   Jay-Z's like, "Look at all these people I brought together."
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.180]   Jay-Z's Goodwill.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.300]   And Jay-Z says, "I will talk to Madonna.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.420]   I will talk to Daft Punk.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.340]   I will help negotiate these deals."
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.340]   That's what Apple...
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.340]   If Apple's smart, that's...
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.340]   And I know they are doing this.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.780]   They're really curating favor with the music industry.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.780]   And you're right.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.540]   They're just going to let Spotify with her on the line.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.460]   And everybody else except Amazon and Google with her on the line.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.460]   Well, Spotify pays what?
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.460]   80 to 85% of its revenue back to record companies for...
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.660]   And that number is selected by the record...
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.380]   And it's not going to go down.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.420]   And so they have to send out a squeeze out of profit from that.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.500]   I don't think it's actually numerically possible long-term with the better terms.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.500]   They can't.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.500]   They've never made money, right?
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.500]   No, they lose lots of it.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.260]   Well, so far as we can tell from other disclosures...
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:57.500]   The only question is whether the music industry fears Apple and they should, right?
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.140]   Because the real problem, in the past they have feared Apple because Apple...
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.860]   The iTunes store is the number one music store by far.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.500]   Not just digital music, but in general, I mean, all Sam goodies is not even close.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:16.100]   So I think if I were the music industry, I'd worry because all Apple has to do is shut
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.420]   down all of these competitors and then say, "Oh, and by the way, music industry, you're
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.900]   getting one tenth to one percent from now on."
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.900]   What are they going to do?
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.220]   That's why I would support Spotify if I was them.
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.500]   I would try to find a lot of Spotify alive because Apple will not only come along and
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   give you a hug and then stab you and take away your ports.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   Well, Amazon.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.940]   But Amazon's same thing, right?
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.940]   Amazon's same thing.
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.740]   That's what they do with the publishers.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.060]   Microsoft has a history of doing the same thing with everything.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.060]   Embrace and devour?
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.060]   Embrace and destroy.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.740]   Hug, stab, you know, whatever you want to call it.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.940]   But businesses, they just want to make money.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.940]   Shocking.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.940]   Apple profit businesses want to increase their margins.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.660]   Oh my God, you said the most important thing of any Twitch show ever.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.660]   It's all there are.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.660]   If you call Karl Marx, if you think you're just one of the phone makers or computer makers
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.860]   that loves you, I mean, they love your money.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.860]   No, they don't love me.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.860]   But for the most part, they're business.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.860]   They're there to make money.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.020]   I love you, Steve Jobs.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.020]   You don't love me?
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.100]   I'm not allowed to talk about Steve Jobs anymore.
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.100]   What?
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.100]   Nothing.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.100]   Did you get in trouble?
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.100]   On this show.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.100]   On this show?
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.100]   Oh, you don't remember a good.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.100]   No, mine then.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.100]   Anyway, so music industry is really interesting.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.500]   Let's roll back the tape.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.500]   Let's not.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.500]   We have a clip.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.500]   We have a clip.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   Oh, you made him spin up his Red Bull.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.500]   Careful now.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.500]   It's cold.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.300]   There's a lot of sugar in that.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.740]   Do not spit that on your keyboard.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.980]   Well, corporate laptop, so it's fine.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   Oh, yeah, it's better.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.580]   Mattermark has dozens of them.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.540]   I noticed we got two MacBook ears.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.260]   We got an iPad and an iPhone.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.260]   I have a MacBook and a Mac.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.260]   Unused.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.620]   And I have a 17 inch laptop.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.300]   This thing is just plain large.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.300]   You like it?
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.300]   It's huge.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.300]   What's it running?
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.300]   I mean, it just stays here, right?
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.300]   Yeah, it doesn't move.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.300]   You don't like it.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.300]   Okay.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.300]   It's fine.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.300]   It's got an hour battery life.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.300]   You don't unplug it.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.940]   I can barely get it across the studio.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.500]   But when you plug it in, all these lights dim, right?
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.100]   But, yeah, it's got a 980M in it, an I7 processor.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   Wow.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.060]   It's got an M.2 SSD.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.980]   It's a nice screamer.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:14.980]   And it's running Ubuntu.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.980]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:16.980]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.980]   When you need all that, how are you doing?
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.980]   If all you do is run your Chrome.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.180]   It doesn't matter.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.900]   It's all the same.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.700]   By the way, I think Microsoft has found that out, which is one of the reasons this is
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.500]   the last version of Windows ever.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.700]   In my opinion, now you were an editor of Windows Magazine.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.700]   Yeah, I was.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.180]   Yeah, so the editor.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:40.020]   You've watched for years as Microsoft version after version every four or five years, another
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.140]   version of Windows.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.660]   At the end of this month, actually August 2nd, went exactly one month from yesterday.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.100]   You're going to release the anniversary update to Windows 10.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.980]   And it seems pretty clear they are not ever going to do.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.420]   And they've said this, a Windows 11.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.180]   This is the last version of Windows.
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.860]   Yeah, it makes sense.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.260]   Everything is different now.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.140]   Nobody's clamoring for the next version of Windows, obviously.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.140]   I'll even point this out.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.580]   If we're all running Chrome, it doesn't matter if using an iPad, a Linux laptop, a Mac laptop,
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.020]   or a Windows laptop.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:13.900]   It's just a, it's a thin client now.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.900]   Exactly.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.260]   That was actually a big battle.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.500]   Nobody, the kids in the audience don't remember this.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.500]   But there was a time when, who was it?
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.500]   Larry Ellison.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.700]   Remember the computer or whatever it's called?
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.700]   Think.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.700]   Think.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.700]   What was that?
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.700]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.700]   And he had this vision for this networked computers, cloud computing, essentially.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.460]   And everybody was like, yeah, people want to own their own giant PC.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:40.260]   And they want to upgrade it with two more megabytes of RAM.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.540]   And so there was this whole battle.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.380]   And nobody could imagine a future when the internet was fast enough where you could
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.380]   actually do cloud computing.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.980]   Well, that's, that's the paradigm now.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.900]   Nobody cares about, here's a blog post about powerful hardware.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.500]   Web informant from 2000.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.500]   You're right, Mike.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.500]   Yes.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.380]   The idea of a computer that's designed around a web browser is an intriguing notion.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.060]   But the more I use the new internet computer, that's what the NIC is.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.460]   The creation of Larry Ellison, the more I disliked it.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.900]   No wonder it was a 256 megahertz PC.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.900]   Right.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.900]   Also has Larry Ellison attached to it.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.900]   So I hate about fault.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.900]   Exactly.
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.980]   He's my favorite super villain.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.180]   Well, okay.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.860]   You know, I just talked to somebody who was staying at the Four Seasons on his island,
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.820]   Larry's Island, in Illinois.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.820]   Yeah, of course.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:26.500]   And he said the people of Lanai, super villain has to have an island, right?
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.900]   I hope it has a volcano that he could put his lair in.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.140]   But yeah, I'm sure it might.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.140]   Hawaiian Island.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.140]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.660]   It's King Kamehameha's old island.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.660]   So who knows?
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.380]   Well, you know.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.540]   But Johnny Jenner, Travel Guru, was staying there.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.700]   He said, you know what, the people of Lanai love Larry.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.700]   There's only.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.700]   It's 3,500 people.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:43.700]   It's not a.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.340]   It wasn't really much going on before.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.340]   Dole pulled out.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.780]   It was a big pineapple plantation.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.780]   Dole pulled out.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.180]   These people were all out of work.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.380]   Larry moves in, buys the island, starts to renovate the hotels, builds them a baseball
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.620]   diamond in the community center, and makes sure everybody's employed, even the people
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.540]   who were unemployed, made unemployed by the renovation of the hotel.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.860]   He found other work for them.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.860]   They love him.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.860]   He's in trinkets, basically.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:10.180]   At least he didn't build a wall like Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.180]   That's true.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.060]   He's like, we're, you know, a lot of people are building walls.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.060]   We hit, then he built a wall.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.060]   And he built a wall.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.060]   And he built a wall.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.060]   Why?
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.060]   Did he really?
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.060]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.060]   He did.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.060]   He did.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.060]   And then the people who were like, I can't.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.060]   It's a big stone wall.
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.060]   Like 8, 10 feet or something like that.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.060]   So the people who live, can't see the ocean.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.060]   He's along with his wall?
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.060]   The people who lived here can't see over the wall.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.060]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.060]   He's blocking the view of blocking the view.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.180]   He moved in and was like, you know what, this is an awesome view.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.460]   The rest of you.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.460]   You look up that.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.580]   I'll look up his quote about how bad it is to build walls.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.180]   It's supposed to be easy when to block off the public beach.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.180]   It's a six-foot-foot coastline.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.180]   Oh, no, of course not.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.180]   You're still doing it.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.580]   They're trying to sue him and stuff and stuff like him.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.980]   Mark has built a, oh, look at the size of that.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.500]   He's built a six-foot wall around his ocean front property.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.500]   And Trump must be jealous.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.900]   Oh, how do I get one of those?
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:59.460]   And he made the Hawaiians pay for it.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.460]   Look at that.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.300]   It's pretty damn ugly.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.460]   It's not even like a nice stone wall.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.180]   It's like he has a, it's in Kilauea.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.940]   He has a 700-acre property in Kilauea.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.700]   Apparently to block noise from nearby roads.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.820]   Oh, there's Becky Worley.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:16.820]   She knows who I am.
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.820]   Our own, Becky.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.820]   Our own.
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.220]   Twits Becky Worley, also ABC News technology contributor.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.780]   She knows Hawaii.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.420]   Grew up there.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.980]   So wow.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.420]   It's a very unattractive wall.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.420]   So in Zuckerberg--
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.900]   But have you ever seen a wall and gone?
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.300]   That wall is just gorgeous.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   That wall-- wait, where?
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.340]   Usually not six-foot tall wall.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.500]   By the way, Mark is five foot eight.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.340]   I think he could just put up--
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:40.860]   --plant.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.100]   Even he can't see over.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:42.700]   You can see.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.700]   I got one of these.
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.100]   I'm going to listen to Haidasum very quickly.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.180]   Yeah, it's purple.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.180]   It's great.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:49.980]   Thanks, Mark.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.540]   I can't see.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.140]   What?
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.060]   I want new friends.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.780]   How's it surf, Roberto?
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.140]   Blog.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.100]   You know, and it's not the block of road noise.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.420]   It's to keep people out.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.260]   It's to keep out the river.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.860]   You know, in April, he was lashing out at Donald Trump
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.620]   and said that he's heard fearful voices calling
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.620]   for building walls.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.660]   This was at FA.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.180]   Yes.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.580]   And he said, we believe in building bridges, not walls.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.020]   Exactly.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.820]   And that wasn't true, apparently.
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.100]   So he hasn't built any bridges.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.700]   Three-word headline.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.660]   Area, billionaire, hypocrite.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:18.180]   Yes.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:19.620]   That's right.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.380]   ABH.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.220]   ABH.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.860]   Yeah, just let's-- we'll have shorthand for that,
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.860]   and that'll be it.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.420]   All right, we're going to take a break, come back
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.580]   with more great panel here.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.020]   Alex Wilhelm from Mattermark.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.940]   What do you do at Mattermark here?
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.340]   An analyst, you're an EIC.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.860]   I just write a lot about finance and tech.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.580]   Yeah, mostly finance, though.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:35.140]   Tech finance.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.020]   That's what your-- that's what your--
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.860]   That's what your clients are interested in.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.620]   No.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.140]   I don't know.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:39.980]   I'm not part of that, Tim.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.100]   I just want to wrap it up if I want to.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:41.580]   OK.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.580]   So you're an analyst, but you're a good guy analyst.
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.620]   You're one of the nice--
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.020]   Independent journalist analyst.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.020]   That's nice.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.980]   That's the thing everybody's doing now, right?
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.460]   It's really-- it's interesting.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.060]   It's enjoyable.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.500]   I'll have to do a cycle, but I have more time to write on each
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.420]   new little piece of thing that I produce.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.100]   There was a great article in the New York Magazine
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.780]   last week on Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post.
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.780]   And there is a case to be made that if you're going to have--
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.940]   continue to have journalism, you might need deep pockets
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.460]   to fund this.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.900]   That's on the show notes, actually.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.500]   We'll talk about it.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.100]   We'll get there.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:10.900]   Yep.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.660]   Also here for Mangajit.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.540]   I hear they have AOL behind them.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.700]   And Verizon behind them.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.260]   Behind AOL is Verizon.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.740]   And behind Verizon?
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.180]   Who knows?
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.660]   Carlos Slim.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.620]   I don't know.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.380]   That could be true, actually.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:23.820]   It could be.
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.380]   We don't know.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:24.860]   No one knows.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.380]   I mean, they don't even mean things to say about Verizon.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:26.880]   No.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.420]   I have nothing to do with my individual.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.140]   So they don't have come in and say it would be nice if you
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.500]   were to refute it, and no droid is a positive thing.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.540]   No one's ever--
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.220]   No, of course, no one for me at all, Verizon,
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.500]   has ever said anything to me about anything.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.820]   And I rip on Verizon all the time, which would ruin the value
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.700]   of Mangajit, frankly.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.780]   I think people who say, oh, well, can an Engajit ever
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.340]   be truly independent now that it is?
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.700]   If they did, though, it'd be a great last story for you.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.340]   Because you would write that story.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.740]   Because everyone on staff would--
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.420]   If you were a horse right away, we're all on Twitter just
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.860]   like boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:00.340]   There--
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.580]   OK, there's going to be a lot of media.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.740]   There's the real value to Twitter, isn't there?
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.860]   There is always still an outlet for people to say what they
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.300]   think, and people are reading it.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.060]   And not going to pay for it.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.020]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.420]   Yeah, I'll get paid.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.940]   Hey, page made.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.460]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.220]   Someone would pay me if Verizon made me.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.740]   I got a New Journalism for the money.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.060]   I don't know what happened.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:18.700]   So did I.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.460]   And a big mistake.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.020]   Big mistake.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:21.820]   That's Mike Elgin.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.380]   He is a digital nomad, and you can read more at Elgin.com,
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.580]   which probably does it still redirect us to Google?
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.100]   No, it doesn't.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:28.860]   It's the Elgin.com.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.860]   It's a whole site now.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.420]   Fifth anniversary of Google+ last week.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.660]   Yeah, it's not exciting.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.620]   Yeah, I heard that.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.900]   I read about it on Twitter.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.900]   I'm curious what you think.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.540]   Our show today brought to you by Fresh--
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.980]   but we'll talk about that too-- Fresh Books,
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.420]   the super simple cloud accounting software that's
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.300]   helping people who are freelancers, work for themselves,
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.820]   keep track of their invoices, their money, save time,
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.860]   billing, get paid faster.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.220]   Look, it is no fun.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:58.700]   Let's face it.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.700]   You don't get into business because you're so excited
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.620]   about the day-to-day admin work.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.180]   You don't get into business because you like printing
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.580]   and mailing invoices because you like
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.140]   dunning, slow-pay clients.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:09.740]   No.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.340]   But if you're in business, you need to do that.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.140]   So you'll get paid.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:18.100]   5 million small business owners use Fresh Books, the dead,
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.380]   simple cloud accounting software, to transform how they
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:24.460]   feel and handle their paperwork, how they feel about it,
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.500]   and how they handle it.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.660]   It starts with the invoicing.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.660]   I mean, that's how I started using Fresh Books
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.340]   more than 10 years ago.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.180]   You can create and send an invoice in about 30 seconds.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.180]   It's easy.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.940]   It handles all different currencies
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.540]   that you can import time and hours from the Fresh Books app.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.020]   The app is great.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.620]   Of course, there's branding on your invoice.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.980]   You could set recurring invoices.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.780]   You could attach receipts.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.420]   You can even set up with your client
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.780]   that the invoice is automatically sent and automatically
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.580]   paid.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.580]   Believe it or not, your clients hate paying bills
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.780]   as much as you hate sending bills.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.300]   Nobody enjoys the paperwork.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.540]   Make it easy for them.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.540]   Your clients can even pay online, which
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.340]   means you get paid a lot faster on average, about five days
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.980]   faster with Fresh Books.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.780]   And if they don't pay, auto payment reminders,
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.420]   make it easy to keep on track.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.060]   You know, Lee, I use Fresh Books all the time.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:11.420]   No.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:11.940]   Yeah, I do.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.460]   I love it.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.300]   It's fantastic.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:13.820]   That's awesome.
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.020]   It's great because you can pre-configure every one of the fields.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.060]   I just select the publisher, and it knows everything else.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.780]   It knows how much I get paid for each column and all kinds of stuff.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.220]   And then here's the part that nobody ever talks about that
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.180]   is one of the best things.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.540]   And it's a simple little thing.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:34.020]   But sometimes I worry whether they got it, my invoice.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.540]   They pay on monthly cycles.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.740]   So if I miss a cycle, it's another month.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.780]   So you can just go to the site and look and say, yep, they open it.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.940]   They saw it.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.580]   I love that because sometimes clients-- not your clients,
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.380]   but some clients will say, oh, I didn't get the invoice.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.380]   You say, no, you did.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.940]   You see you opened it on Friday.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.620]   I could see it right here.
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:52.980]   You could also get deposits.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.660]   This is something new.
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.860]   I don't know how exactly it works,
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.420]   but you can invoice for a payment upfront.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.180]   So a lot of times I was expensing stuff.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.540]   And it does make it very easy.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.420]   You can take a picture of the receipt with your phone.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.020]   It automatically gets in the invoice.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.540]   But this will also let you request a deposit upfront
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:12.940]   so that you can not be spending your own money on the project.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.700]   And they'll dole it out and everything.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.380]   It's really kind of neat.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.820]   When it comes time to pay the taxes,
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.060]   the reports are fantastic.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.580]   You get so much from FreshBooks.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:25.020]   They even have an EMV chip card enabled card reader,
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.900]   which means if you're doing work at people's houses
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.260]   or on their premises, you can go there.
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.660]   You can create an invoice.
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.540]   You actually can create an estimate, create an invoice,
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:39.380]   get paid right in one place, all in your FreshBooks app,
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.420]   right there, right then.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.660]   Getting started is easy.
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.180]   And we got a 30-day free trial at freshbooks.com/twit.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.300]   All we ask is mention this week in tech.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.500]   And how did you hear about a section that way?
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:56.820]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.420]   I have to log back into my computer.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.740]   I have to now time my ad so it's exactly the sleep time
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.620]   on the computer so I can log back in.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.660]   Let's see.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.820]   The ultimate Apple I/O death chart.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.420]   I missed this.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.220]   This is something from the Verge.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.660]   Niele Patel--
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.060]   Oh, Niele has been so angry about the headphone thing.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.220]   He says, "stupid and hostile to users."
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:25.140]   So they built a nice chart about how, when they opened and closed,
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.140]   each of these technologies--
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.100]   ADB.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:28.740]   Oh, remember that?
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.620]   The Apple Desktop Bus Cuzzy.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.580]   I do not remember that.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.580]   VGA, DVI, floppy.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.980]   CD, DVD, USB.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.260]   You know, the VGA belongs there.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.140]   That's just--
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:38.900]   They didn't invent that.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.700]   It's not like a thing that they got rid of and now
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.260]   that you don't have displays or whatever.
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:42.980]   What am I going to do?
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   I don't have VGA anymore.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.820]   Fireware.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.020]   That's a sad story.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.460]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:47.980]   That was only--
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.500]   Fireware.
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.820]   Oh, we hardly knew you.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.220]   Thunderbolt is still alive, HDMI.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.060]   That's nice.
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.540]   I have a chart.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.260]   Headline Jack began in 1878.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.260]   That's fine, Jack.
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.980]   It really should go back farther than 1878.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.380]   It really was invented in 1878.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:01.900]   Was it really?
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.420]   Literally?
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:02.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.180]   The basic Jack that they invented for the first telephone
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.780]   operators--
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.340]   The phone on Jack.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.180]   --the current Jack that they--
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.180]   You're nodding, sir, like you were there.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.500]   He remembers it like it was this way.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.060]   He was great for $210.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:16.980]   There has been innovation in--
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.420]   So it's the same Jack as the operators.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.460]   We go, your number plays in the general concept.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.460]   It's very old.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.020]   It's photojack.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.140]   It's like the quarter inch version.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:25.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.500]   Exactly.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.340]   Wow.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:27.780]   That's cool.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:33.420]   By the way, we've mentioned before that the Moto Z
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.500]   doesn't have a headphone jack.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.340]   But see, nobody cares.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.780]   It's like, OK, so what?
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.980]   Good for them.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.260]   All seven users in Captain.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.260]   But then Ellen Tepper sent me an email saying,
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.420]   you know the very first Android phone didn't have a headphone jack.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.780]   The G1 from HTC.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.780]   Well, that's probably why I don't want to bother.
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:47.660]   I don't want the board going up.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.900]   I think the solution--
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.740]   John, can you go get my--
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.500]   you know that G1, it's the slide up first generation--
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.940]   It didn't fall apart between the board those on a mouse?
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.660]   I probably didn't use it for very long.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.100]   OK.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.580]   It's on the second shelf.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.980]   Their work around was that you don't listen to music.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.500]   They said that.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.980]   You had--
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.980]   And like phones in that era-- because remember,
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.140]   this is what 2008 or something.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:14.180]   They had a proprietary plug that you would charge it with.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:14.660]   And then that had a head-f
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.500]   Sounds familiar.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.700]   Yeah, and you're right.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.380]   Not exactly a hot selling item.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:27.340]   Android N is coming, and we now know it's nougat.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.180]   Did you find it?
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:29.580]   Let me see.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.780]   Is it a slider?
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.580]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.140]   He picked it up.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:32.620]   It just--
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.060]   Wow, it has hand.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:34.780]   Oh my god.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.060]   It left me in history.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.580]   Wow.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.020]   This is the first-- well, I saved it because it was the first Android phone, right?
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.620]   It even says Google on the back, but HTC made it.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.860]   I think they sold it as the desire or something like that.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.100]   Looks different now.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:46.460]   Doesn't it?
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.380]   It looks smaller and weirder and fatter.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:48.740]   It looks good.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.100]   Toa, you get the funfare.
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:50.660]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.140]   And then--
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:51.980]   Like a hot machine.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.500]   Exactly.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:52.980]   Look at that.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:52.980]   You're like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.140]   This was because Blackberry was still hot, right?
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:55.700]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.660]   Had to have a keyboard.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.900]   And this is a very Blackberry thumb type keyboard.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:42:59.660]   But yeah, let's see.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:00.740]   There's no--
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.180]   nope, just a weird--
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:06.780]   oh, John, now we know what that cable that we found goes to.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.180]   That weird, notched cable.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.140]   I think we have that cable.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.500]   We kept it.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.220]   So let's-- you know what is fun is to take your old phone and plug it in
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.340]   and see what's on there.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:17.860]   No.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.500]   I have a trio.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.060]   I mean, it's like you were getting pictures.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:22.900]   And let's see what you got.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.940]   I got pictures of my butt before it's tagged.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:25.940]   In here.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:26.460]   Ah.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.620]   Oh, well, let's--
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.700]   Let's find the charger.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.860]   John, don't find the charger.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.340]   Until I'm just painful enough, do not give me an actual copy.
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:32.860]   Please.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:33.540]   I wonder what--
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.300]   I mean, what the thinking was and not--
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.060]   they didn't have a hedge fund jack on that.
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.100]   I think Apple should bring back the little plastic thing
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:39.820]   that you have to--
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.340]   Oh, come on.
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.420]   --feel away to get you down.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:43.540]   That would be great.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.500]   So no, no surprise.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.980]   It's not going to be--
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:50.140]   I'm glad to say Android N is not going
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.420]   to be-- what was it that we thought it would going to be Nutella?
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:54.900]   Nutella.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.580]   Nutella?
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.340]   Well, they were--
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.100]   I shouldn't for nerds.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:57.940]   They were teasing it.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.980]   It was a--
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:43:59.500]   nerds.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.060]   It's not going to be a brand name, which is good.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:01.700]   Oh, it could have been.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.380]   But you could blame--
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.460]   what's his name?
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.300]   Hiroshi Lakhheimer.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.300]   Yock.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:06.820]   Nunk.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.300]   Nunk.
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:07.820]   Nunk.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   You just passed a--
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.700]   Bitcoin guy?
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.340]   Nokheimer.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.380]   Lakhheimer.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.180]   What's his name?
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:12.500]   I don't know.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.460]   Hiroshi Lakhheimer.
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:14.300]   It's a strange name.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.380]   But anyway, you could blame him because he posted--
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.580]   I'm not-- and you're too going to tell you what it stands for.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.580]   I'm not.
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.460]   And as a result, everybody was sure it was something with a nut.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.500]   But I thought even early on, Nougat would be--
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.340]   Is it pronounced Nougat or is it nugget?
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:28.820]   Nougat.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.820]   Nougat.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.820]   Nougat.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.820]   And what is--
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:32.820]   I'm not--
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.820]   You've never had Nougat.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.980]   I may have had Nougat, but to pronounce it wrong.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.740]   So what is it?
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.420]   It's like a chewy thing with nuts in it.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.660]   Like Laffetaffy.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:39.100]   It's the end of the--
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.660]   No, it is not like Naffetaffy.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.020]   Oh, I'm trying to learn here.
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.300]   It's the end of the--
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.940]   It's a confection made with sugar or honey, roasted nuts,
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:50.180]   whipped egg whites, and occasionally chopped candied fruit.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.220]   I don't think I've had Nougat.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.220]   So maybe you're not--
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.220]   You're not a messenger.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:57.020]   And so Nougat is-- there's Turone, which is an Italian nougat.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.100]   But there's a town in France and Alsace.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.020]   You'll probably be there.
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.180]   I will go and have this just--
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.180]   It's famous for Nougat.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.580]   In fact, they're so famous for Nougat.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.740]   I remember when I was there in the '60s,
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.140]   you could buy Nougat everywhere.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.900]   The gas station had giant Nougat sculptures in the window,
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.140]   everywhere you could go.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.060]   But don't get a station, Nougat.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.060]   Because that's not--
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.620]   Eat gas station, Nougat.
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.700]   Can you get it infused with weed?
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.540]   They probably can.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.260]   Probably can.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.020]   But don't eat the whole bar, Nougat.
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.500]   No, whatever you do.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.020]   That's a conversation.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:25.540]   That's a conversation.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:29.180]   So, Leo, what's in Nougat for Android?
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.980]   Walnuts pistachios, Hazelnuts.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.380]   G-H-C, C-B-D, C-B-N.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.620]   I don't know.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.940]   And is the name they unveiled, of course, as they do.
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.060]   The Android statue is standing on giant Nougat bars.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:42.740]   So there you go.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.460]   That's your picture of Nougat, Alex.
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.660]   Which is less attractive.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.580]   Android's interface for that statue.
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.980]   They probably have outgrown that logo a little bit.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:52.900]   But we're all attached to it now.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.580]   Oh, OK.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.620]   I didn't know that.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.100]   Oh, my God.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.420]   You can't get away from it.
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.220]   When you update Android, it's got the little antennas going
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:45:59.860]   like this.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.700]   And oh, my God.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.620]   It's got the--
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.740]   This is really out of peeling.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.260]   It's got the-- when you're upgrading Android,
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.700]   it's like a nuclear belly.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:08.860]   It's intense.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:09.300]   The nuclear belly.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.180]   And they put the thing in the nuclear belly.
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:11.700]   It's all pudding.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.580]   It is kind of-- if you think about it.
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.580]   Not really something you want.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:15.820]   No.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:20.620]   He says like OS crone is just user something.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:21.700]   It's something adorable.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.700]   That's disgusting.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.580]   Anyway, I don't-- there really isn't news associated with that.
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.700]   In fact, the only news is that the names--
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:29.700]   It's the message that you see.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.060]   Man, you're pointing it in the letter.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.700]   It makes it a big deal out of like--
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.060]   Oh, we don't know what it's going to be.
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.300]   Oh, everybody, internet name it.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.260]   It's not even the name.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.140]   It's the code name.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:38.580]   It's like--
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.780]   Right.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:40.340]   It's Android.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:40.900]   It's Android.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.900]   It's Android.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.620]   And it's new.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.060]   Seven?
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.460]   We don't know.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.540]   They might call it a "sitting" tab.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.620]   We don't know.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:52.300]   There is rumor of a foot that Google will do its own new phone
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:57.260]   that will be not a developer headset like the Nexus phones,
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.500]   but actually a top of the line flagship phone.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.620]   I have a conspiracy theory for you about why they might do this.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.860]   Yeah, because why?
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.420]   Because it doesn't make sense.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:11.460]   Ron and Mario did a good column about why it doesn't make sense.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.700]   They've got things going their way pretty much.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.420]   They would be competing against direct competitors.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.300]   Initially, I thought, oh, I know what they're going to do.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.980]   They're going to build a project tango in every single phone
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.140]   and subsidize it, make it cheap and all that stuff.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:24.980]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.700]   I think this is what makes sense.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.500]   They're under fire around the world, especially in Europe,
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.500]   but they're also talking about it in the US again,
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.620]   around antitrust and Android.
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.180]   Because Google wants to--
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.820]   Google is paying some companies to add.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.020]   In other cases, they're not paying,
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.580]   but they're trying to get all the Android handset makers
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.620]   to build in all the Google stuff.
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:46.460]   They really want that.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.340]   That's all point of Android.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.860]   You can download the open source AOSP version of Android,
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.700]   but it has no Google services in it.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.300]   That's free.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.420]   Anybody can make a phone.
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.420]   That's what Amazon does.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:55.420]   Exactly.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.020]   They modify it and they make their fire tablets.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.780]   But most customers want Google services.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:02.980]   They want Google Play Store.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.580]   They want Google Maps.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.180]   And so as a result, Google says, OK, you could do that.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.900]   But here's the rules.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.940]   A, you've got to get our approval.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.580]   And B, you can't make a phone without it.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.420]   So that's the thing the EU doesn't like.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   The EU says, no, that's monopolistic.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.380]   If you didn't say to Amazon, for instance, OK,
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.620]   you can make a standard Android phone with Google services,
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.380]   but that means you can't make a non-Google AOSP phone.
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.300]   That's Google's rules.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.300]   So here's the conspiracy.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:35.620]   So I think that one reason to come out with a phone for themselves
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.140]   is they themselves can build everything in,
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.380]   just like AOSP.
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.340]   And so I think it's a kind of bludgeon to get the OEMs
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.940]   to voluntarily put that stuff in.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.220]   Because, for example, let's say Europe said, OK, no.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.340]   There's no way you can coerce handset makers to build in.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.420]   They can do whatever they want.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.460]   And Google, there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.540]   Well, there's no point for Google to even have Android
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.500]   in that market.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.820]   So Google can say, OK, well, we have a phone.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.740]   Then we're going to sell our phone in Europe only.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.500]   And so knowing that this exists, the OEMs will be like, OK,
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.860]   we're going to play ball because we don't want
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.580]   to have to compete with you directly where you're going
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.580]   to be selling the synthesizer.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.580]   No, OEM is worried about Google.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.860]   I know OEMs.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.060]   Look at the Nexus phones don't sell like crazy.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.820]   But look at what consumers want.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.580]   They want the vanilla Google experience.
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.380]   More and more, they do.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.460]   But that's something a handset manufacturer can do.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.060]   But they're not doing as much as the consumers want it.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.300]   It's like Google can have the most vanilla thing.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.500]   OK, really, there's only one--
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.100]   OEM that matters at that level, the selection level,
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:35.900]   and that's Samsung.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.300]   And of course, they do crap up their phones with Samsung.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.980]   Of less and less, though, each generation, right?
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.140]   The next Samsung phone will be the note--
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:46.460]   we think it'll be the note-- seven this fall.
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.980]   People aren't going to say, oh, here's a Google phone
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.140]   I can get instead of that note.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:55.100]   I think in general, observers of the tech scene
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.420]   underestimate the panic and fear that companies like Google
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:02.540]   and Apple have that they're going to be locked out of a situation.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.740]   Apple is building a car for crying out loud
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.220]   for one and only reason so that they don't get locked out
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.660]   of the cars, right?
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.060]   All the cars.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.620]   Google came out with Android for one and only reason.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:14.460]   They didn't want to get locked out of the smartphone.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.060]   Apple's not doing a car because they are--
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:16.580]   Absolutely.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.540]   People won't put Apple--
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.420]   It's a car--
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.020]   --content consumption experience.
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.140]   They think of the car as a content consumption.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.300]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:24.660]   It's a living room.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.020]   It's a rolling iPod?
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:26.900]   Yes.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.020]   And VR living room and all the rest.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:33.060]   This to me is the intersection of software platform companies.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.420]   Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon,
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.940]   trying to interact with the real world with varying levels of success.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.060]   Apple's a hardware company.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.540]   Apple's always been a hardware company.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:42.300]   They're a platform company that has done well in hardware
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.980]   and better than their opponents.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.260]   Or converted.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.180]   They did software.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.860]   They did platform only because they felt
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.940]   that was the best way to sell hardware.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:49.940]   And it's only recently--
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.940]   --everything is to sell the iPhone.
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:52.620]   But that choice was only recently--
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.260]   --the platform is fast.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.540]   --they started to consider having a future beyond selling hardware.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.260]   And that's partly because their services--
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.580]   weirdly enough because they're crap--
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.380]   their services are a big part of their profit center now.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:04.660]   So--
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.700]   What percentage compared to the iPhone?
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.740]   Well, iPhone is still killer.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.820]   But services-- I can't remember what it was.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.300]   It was like a $6 billion business.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:11.900]   It was not an--
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.740]   In your counting fees to the app store and so forth,
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:14.500]   that's part of that number?
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.500]   And iTunes sales.
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.020]   Right.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:16.020]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:16.520]   Right.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.020]   Right.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.380]   Not just iCloud, obviously.
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:18.700]   But--
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.620]   I closed $6 of that total?
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.340]   Well, no, because everybody who buys an iPhone
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.740]   also ends up getting coerced into buying more iCloud storage
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.060]   for a buck or two bucks a month.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:28.820]   That's a nice and new.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:29.900]   It would work if you can get it.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.740]   So Apple-- your Apple is now maybe more of a platform
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.500]   company than they used to be.
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.980]   But they really were a hardware company.
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:36.180]   True.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.620]   But in Google's case, for example, going back--
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.660]   Google is clearly a hardware.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.020]   They're going from software to hardware.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:40.980]   And that's the much harder--
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.380]   Well, and that's exactly right.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:42.740]   That's why--
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:43.140]   That's why it all--
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:43.580]   --all do buy this.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.460]   --fail for a reason.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.100]   I mean, they would drive several billion dollars
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.220]   of goodwill for a reason.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.140]   And I don't see how this is anything different.
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.220]   I completely agree with that.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.260]   I don't think they're going to do it.
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:53.420]   I think this is a phony rumor.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.460]   I don't even think they are even contemplating it.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:55.820]   Google is not--
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:55.900]   Google is not--
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:55.900]   Google is not--
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.980]   Google is 10 million hardware.
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.660]   I mean, look, every company tries stuff.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.660]   This is one of the problems.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.860]   It's hard to cover Apple because, yeah, they probably
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.340]   are making every possible product somewhere inside of Apple.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.300]   But this means they're going to ever release any of those.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.340]   I mean, they're not going to get an HD Apple TV.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:11.900]   No, sorry.
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.740]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.460]   You may not even get an Apple car.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:16.540]   I mean, I don't think that that's a--
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.740]   I don't even have to make a car.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.020]   They could just get all those people in there,
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:23.540]   figure out what they need, partner with Volkswagen, Toyota,
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.380]   Honda, Ford, whoever, and then have--
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:29.460]   They're the dash, even though these automakers are concerned
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.500]   about losing the dashboard to Apple or to Google or to whoever.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.220]   That's a perfect analogy for what Google's doing, right?
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.420]   Google makes the software, and they've partnered up to now.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.020]   Even this was made by HTC, this first Android phone.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:45.540]   They partnered up to now with traditional OEMs, not Ford and GM,
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:49.220]   but HTC, LG, and Samsung to make their devices.
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.860]   So that's the only reason this is a news story
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.380]   is that Google might make their own.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:59.220]   But the core of this is why did Google acquire Android
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.180]   and why do they have Android?
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.540]   I mean, it caused them completely wrecking their relationship
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.900]   with Apple and Steve Jobs.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.500]   Doesn't matter, because they're selling more--
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.260]   far more Android phones are sold worldwide.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.260]   But what's the advantage of that?
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.580]   And every one of those Android phones--
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:13.540]   That's the only reason.
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.260]   Google services.
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:20.180]   So they do the open source thing as a little tip of the hat.
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.060]   They know--
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.220]   But the same reason that I'm saying
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.340]   that you can build this phone.
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.900]   So they have a hedge against a world in which they get
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:28.140]   attacked for antitrust.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.020]   Because if they didn't have the open source version,
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:30.580]   then it'd be easy.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.900]   Same reason Bill Gates gave Apple $150 million
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.060]   about to go out of business just so that they wouldn't
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:36.860]   be a monopoly.
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:37.060]   Exactly.
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:39.460]   Wait, that wasn't altruism?
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:42.780]   Oh my god, my knife beating hard.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.980]   I cannot imagine-- first of all, I'm not even sure
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.900]   what the distinction is, because if Google's not
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:50.420]   going to make it their in Mountain View with a hammer
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.700]   and chisel, they're going to go to Foxconn,
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.740]   the same people all these other companies go and have it
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.860]   made their.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.580]   Amazon's fire phone--
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.860]   It's legal distinction, that's what I say.
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.020]   Google's Motorola Purchase and Nexus Experiments.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.540]   So far, a lackluster.
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:03.260]   Microsoft's partnership with Nokia,
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.220]   a liter of purchase of Nokia's disaster.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.940]   Apple's just sitting around going, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:07.780]   I can pull this off.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.260]   But whenever these other companies go back into this market,
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.500]   I expect losses in lower volumes than they anticipate.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.580]   I mean, the service project will now finally work.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:17.420]   But how much money does service take for Microsoft
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.380]   to get right?
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.300]   And if they keep doing this episodically as Google has,
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.900]   how can they possibly build the momentum needed
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:22.820]   to actually break into it?
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.220]   So I'm the pessimist.
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:24.820]   I was always--
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:25.340]   Start to stop.
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.060]   You got to do it.
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:27.700]   I said the same thing, though, about Apple.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:31.660]   I mean, when Apple was sitting pretty making Macintoshes
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:36.140]   and iPods-- and this was when in 2007, the iPod was king.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.020]   And people said they're going to do a phone.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.340]   I said, that's not a business you want to be in.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.380]   That's a terrible business.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:44.900]   And at the time, it was a terrible business.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.900]   But they-- because they were brilliant,
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.300]   because they created a platform that was significantly
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:51.140]   ahead of the power--
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.700]   Because they didn't want to get locked out
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.860]   of a content consumption experience.
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:57.300]   Maybe they saw the end of the iPod coming?
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.580]   They knew that in the future, in the year 2000 or whatever,
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:02.580]   they--
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.660]   The man is still alive.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.180]   People would watch women can survive.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.260]   People would watch videos and listen to music
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.020]   and eventually do VR and do all this content consumption.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.540]   Apple ultimately does all these different things primarily
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.380]   for content consumption.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:16.500]   They see that as their business model.
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:17.820]   I see that as their business model.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.060]   And I think they do, too.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:22.220]   Since Steve Jobs came back and launched the iPod,
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.940]   they learn, hey, this is what we do.
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.780]   And so that's why they--
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.620]   I said the same thing.
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:27.420]   I'm like, this is nuts.
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.220]   They don't know anything about the phone business.
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.980]   Why are the dunes-- it's crazy.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:31.820]   It's not crazy.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.060]   It's true because we were very, very--
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.740]   Because the phone is a major place
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.900]   where billions of people will consume content
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.940]   that they may or may not be paying for.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.180]   And so Apple was facing a future where they're just irrelevant
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.860]   because people are getting their content
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.340]   and some other people are controlling it.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.380]   Wouldn't it be prudent of Google instead of trying
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.580]   to get in now on the smartphone thing
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.060]   to look at what's next?
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:52.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:53.540]   Right?
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:53.740]   I mean--
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.420]   Well, I try that with that thing in your face.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.660]   And then we're like, oh, god, you're right.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.660]   Well, Mike liked it.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:01.020]   I like-- so--
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.740]   hey, people are--
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.740]   People are--
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.340]   You're like instant back to the--
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.260]   Well, Mike, you're worth it.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.260]   Well, Mike, you're worth anything.
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:13.260]   It was dumb looking, but it was cool.
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.540]   I'm still holding out for the Luxautica,
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.700]   like sunglasses thing that was built in.
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:23.140]   Have you seen the technology that-- who is it?
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.620]   Who are the lens guys?
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.020]   Carl Zeiss.
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:29.500]   Carl Zeiss has a thing that takes that whole chunky thing
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.860]   around the outside and builds it into the lens itself.
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:33.460]   It's like a--
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.540]   That's how it should be a heads up.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:34.780]   That just--
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:35.280]   Yes.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.260]   And that is coming.
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:38.180]   But that's never what glass was.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:40.140]   It was a screen over your eyebrow.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.980]   But the thing of having screens beamed in your eyes,
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:43.700]   that's coming.
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.220]   And that's going to come in for the mainstream--
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.220]   It's going to be very interesting.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.140]   Of course, Google's looking at contact lenses as well,
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:49.780]   which might have that kind of capability.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:50.300]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.580]   And we were talking earlier about the wearables in the ear.
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:53.700]   I mean, I agree with you.
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.140]   Wearables is a category.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.500]   And smart glasses is--
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.940]   And we're investing in.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.060]   But I think that's what's really interesting is,
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:05.300]   I am sure Apple in 2007 looked with great trepidation
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.340]   in this big bet they were making on the iPhone.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.620]   I doubt very much.
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:11.100]   Steve Jobs said, you know, in 10 years,
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.340]   we are going to be the largest company in the world
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:16.020]   because we are going to have hit on the next big thing.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:19.820]   It was as much a gamble for them as glass was for Google.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.500]   It happened to be a very good gamble.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.860]   But they went all in.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:23.380]   No.
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:25.180]   So many companies are like, oh, we're going to kind of
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:25.660]   want to do it.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.060]   And Apple went in and they bullied singular.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.140]   And so you know what we don't want anywhere your bloatware?
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.580]   We don't want your logo on the back.
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:32.900]   And so you're like, OK.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.260]   OK.
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.820]   Like you have to-- Apple goes all in.
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:39.060]   Glass was on all in bet.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.940]   Glass was really interesting addition to Google's--
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:41.700]   Google doesn't go all in.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:42.860]   That's exactly the opposite.
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:43.860]   That's kind of--
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:44.860]   Google's pros.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:47.580]   Oh, spaghetti is as much spaghetti as it can.
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.100]   And maybe they need more wood behind those arrows.
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.220]   You can use that in your next--
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:51.580]   I will.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:55.420]   And that's a hashtag Leo's advice.
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:56.700]   I hate that phrase.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:57.860]   That's like at the end of the day.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.620]   You were sure that's just advice, don't you?
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:00.580]   Like the tech guy?
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:01.340]   No, this is it.
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.540]   Oh, this is it.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.980]   Oh, this is an advice show.
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.020]   We're really sorry, everyone.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.180]   I advise to you, Apple.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.500]   I thought this was the other one.
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:07.860]   Yeah, no.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:08.500]   You know what Apple does?
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:11.100]   You know what Apple does is whatever Leo says,
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:12.860]   let's do the other thing.
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:14.380]   Leo said-- Leo said that.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.100]   Leo said--
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.540]   No, he's going the phone business.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:17.420]   It's a terrible business.
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.020]   Leo said, opening retail stores.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.700]   Gateway just practically went out of business
[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.420]   with retail stores.
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:22.220]   You'd be nuts.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:25.780]   Leo said, Intel, what's wrong with the Power PC?
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.820]   They're like, that's sell chip.
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.340]   That's going places, kids.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.980]   So all Apple doesn't say all the time.
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:31.060]   I know what they're doing.
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:31.940]   We can use this.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:32.980]   Leo, repeat after me.
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:33.580]   Apple.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:34.100]   Apple.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.260]   Remove the headphone jack.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.420]   Remove the headphone jack.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:39.340]   No one wants a headphone jack.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.140]   Make it a difference.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.700]   That's crazy to have them.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:43.540]   Cordered boys, they can't escape.
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:46.460]   Why do you still put holes in your hardware?
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.380]   There's someone at Ethan.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.180]   Because Bluetooth is picking up a phone.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:49.820]   Me like, oh, God.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:50.300]   Oh, God.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.100]   We made a mistake.
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.220]   We made holes in your hardware.
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:52.740]   That was like--
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:53.620]   I'm not in trouble this time.
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:54.180]   That was all the time.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:54.580]   No.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:55.860]   Burn all those phones.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.220]   No.
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:56.740]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:56.740]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:57.380]   Start over.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:57.860]   Start over.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:58.380]   Start over.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:58:58.940]   Let me take a break.
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:00.220]   I'm all in on this thing.
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:00.940]   This is so cool.
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:03.460]   In fact, this is so funny because I see more and more
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:04.220]   of these around.
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:07.020]   And I realize, I kind of-- when I see these, I go,
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.220]   oh, you don't want to lose your stuff either, do you?
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.140]   I have one on my keys.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.700]   It's called the tracker.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.860]   And it lets you track your belongings with Bluetooth.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:17.740]   So what happens is you get a tracker.
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.940]   This is the tracker Bravo, which is very slim and elegant.
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.020]   Actually, my keys aren't here.
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.860]   But you know, I'll open this one up.
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.660]   What color do you like?
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.540]   You should have a different color for every device.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.260]   Animals, you can put them on your cats.
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.140]   Because they're so small and thin and light.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.340]   The tracker Bravo comes with a little-- one
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:36.540]   of those little quarter size batteries
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.540]   that last all year.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:41.180]   When you get the tracker Bravo, you pair it up to your phone.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.660]   There's just a little button on it.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.380]   They put the tracker app on your phone.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.420]   Now, here's what happens.
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:48.100]   It's kind of a two way separation alert.
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.540]   So if your phone and your keys part company,
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:53.380]   it will alert you.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.860]   If you leave your keys on the beach
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:56.940]   and you walk away, your phone will go, beep, beep, beep.
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:59.060]   Your keys are out of range.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.820]   If you leave your phone behind, the tracker will go, beep,
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.540]   beep, beep.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.580]   And here's a cool thing.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.580]   You can push the button on the tracker.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.380]   And it will set off an alert on your phone.
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.900]   Even if your phone is silenced and your phone will start ringing
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.940]   at you, you can make it anything you want.
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.940]   I have Black Sabbath Iron Man.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:15.900]   Good choice.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.900]   Good choice.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.220]   [SINGING]
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:19.700]   When I hear that--
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:20.220]   I'll stop.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.460]   You can't-- you don't want to pay licensing.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.580]   I only played four notes.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.500]   How many notes do I get?
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500]   That was one four notes.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.460]   What's cool, your phone could track up to 10 devices at once.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.100]   So get a bunch of them.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.580]   These things are fantastic.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580]   Now, here's the other thing.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.100]   The only tracker doesn't-- I love it.
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:38.140]   They have the largest crowd GPS network in the world.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.620]   So you might say, well, Bluetooth, that only
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.180]   is good for about 100 feet, right?
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.300]   But if you get past that range-- let's say you leave your keys
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.060]   in the beach and you go home.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.340]   Now you know you've lost your keys.
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.620]   But how does your tracker know?
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.140]   Well, first of all, it knows the last time it saw them.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:55.460]   But then if anybody with a tracker walks by your keys,
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.300]   the tracker on your keys talks to their smartphone app
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.620]   and says, I'm here.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.900]   Tell Leo.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:05.620]   And I get an alert saying, somebody just walked by your keys.
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.340]   They're on the beach.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.340]   That is huge.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:10.500]   And with a million and a half devices out there,
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.260]   this network is everywhere.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.300]   So there's a map.
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.500]   Scroll down a little bit, Carson.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.620]   You can show the map.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:19.380]   This is where all the trackers are all over the world,
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.780]   all over the country, I guess.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.340]   So that is really, really cool.
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:24.460]   That's creepy.
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.140]   Don't lose your stuff in Nevada.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:26.940]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:27.820]   That's like the desert.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:28.700]   Nobody lives there.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.580]   Nobody lives there.
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.860]   Nevada test site.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.380]   Yeah, that's the area 51.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.020]   Don't lose your tracker in area 51.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.300]   You'll never get your stuff back.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.860]   Look at the Bermuda Triangle on the right.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.980]   Nothing there either.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.860]   Tracker uses Bluetooth LAs of the battery last year.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.340]   They have water-resistant cables
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.860]   so you can put it in your pet collar.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.180]   You can even add a laser engraved message to your tracker,
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:47.540]   Bravo.
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:51.500]   So put your pet's serial number or name or whatever on it.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.220]   They just introduced the tracker Atlas.
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.780]   This is also new.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:57.420]   It works with a Bravo or third-party Bluetooth trackers
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.900]   to pinpoint your item on a floor plan of your home.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.100]   So one of the problems, of course,
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.540]   you might say, oh, I know my keys are at home,
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.380]   but I don't know where.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.300]   Well, with the tracker Atlas, you know where.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.980]   Oh, yeah, they're stuck in the cushion.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.940]   You can actually see a floor plan of your house
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:13.180]   and see where your keys are.
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:13.980]   I'm going to-- I'm ugly.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.220]   One of these is the back of the remote.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:16.940]   That's what I really need.
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:19.380]   Well, I really need this because I move every three miles.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:19.740]   I know.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.500]   You're the tracker.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.020]   And it's like, I'm so paranoid.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.140]   Where is that behind?
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.140]   I wish that's like--
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.540]   I was like, what's that?
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.540]   He's really paranoid.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.060]   We have-- yeah, we have--
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.540]   This backpack right here and--
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.340]   Here.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:31.860]   Rolling that.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.260]   Thank you.
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:32.860]   For your backpack.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:33.340]   Thank you.
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:33.500]   Wow.
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.620]   Would you like one?
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.660]   Don't say no.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.660]   I don't lose things.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.660]   I'm not.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.160]   OK.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:39.660]   Fine.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.260]   I'll keep it.
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.260]   Don't lose things.
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.300]   Yeah, I don't lose things.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:42.900]   Oh, with the idea.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.860]   Is that going to bite him in the ass?
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:46.220]   Thetracker.com.
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.580]   The hardest thing to find right now will be the website
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:49.500]   because they spell it funky.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.860]   T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com.
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.220]   There's no E at the end there.

[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:13.900]   Elgin.com.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.580]   He's about to leave for France in a week.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:16.620]   South of France.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:17.380]   South of France.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:17.900]   Fun.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.900]   Nice, Marseille, and--
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.420]   X.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.260]   We're going to be there next year.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:23.620]   Really?
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.140]   We're taking a river cruise up the south.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:26.940]   I'll warm them up for you.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.780]   The one from PBS?
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:29.540]   TBS?
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.620]   No, PBS.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.340]   No, I am taking a PBS cruise in the fall.
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.460]   What's the one?
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.460]   Julia Child's going to be on it right here.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.260]   I got all excited.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.780]   And I said, previous guests have included.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.180]   So no, I am taking-- believe it or not,
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.140]   it's just a coincidence.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:47.140]   I'm taking a PBS cruise to the Baltic.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.860]   I can't wait to see who's on board.
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:49.900]   Maybe Garrison Keeler.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:50.980]   I don't know.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:54.140]   Maybe some Muppets?
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.660]   That's Roberta Baldwin mocking me.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.620]   I'm not mocking you.
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.140]   You're mocking me.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.260]   I'm not going anywhere.
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:03:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.020]   I'm going anywhere else.
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.020]   You're not going anywhere, buddy, boy.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.540]   I just say, when I'm not talking, I'm just going to my--
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.140]   When's your next Facebook?
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:06.620]   When's your next--
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.060]   Oh, no, don't do that.
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.060]   It's a lot of food.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:09.900]   Oh, you do a photo.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.620]   You do a photo.
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.940]   It's a very hungry photo feed.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.500]   Yeah, this is a FOMO feed.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.580]   How's Vann doing?
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.020]   Doing well.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:15.820]   Next performance?
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:16.420]   Friday.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.140]   Where?
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.340]   At the Rickshaw Stop in San Francisco,
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.060]   we're doing a print show.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:21.500]   What?
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:21.820]   Prints?
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.820]   Oh, you're going to do the print show.
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:23.620]   You're going to do the print show.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.380]   Have you done that already?
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.260]   Or is this the first one?
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.020]   This is the first one.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.340]   Because he's learning how doves bleed?
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:29.820]   Cry.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.180]   Cry.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:30.860]   Cry.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.860]   Cry.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.660]   Where doves explode?
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:35.220]   Crash.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:35.820]   What is it?
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.180]   They ran him as a--
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:37.660]   Just--
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:38.620]   We've got to say get it right.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:39.700]   You're learning that.
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.660]   [GROANING]
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.260]   I'm going to do that with a synthesizer.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.620]   We have a vocoder on the synthesizer.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:48.060]   But are you going to learn this kind of like the strange vocal
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:48.540]   things that you do?
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.940]   I've been working on my print screams.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.780]   Oh, do you want to give us a sample?
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.280]   Ugh.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.020]   So I got it.
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:55.520]   Good.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.020]   Very good.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:58.580]   Is that going to be punched by a smart?
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.940]   It's like, oh.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.820]   That's the sort of print.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.260]   That's the beginning of a couple songs
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.980]   in the middle of a few songs.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.480]   Oh.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.740]   You're going to wear the whole print's outfit, the purple.
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.420]   No, I have a nice purple tie.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.060]   I sing a bunch of songs.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.540]   But we have other singers in the band.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.580]   What's the name of your band?
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.340]   Controversy.
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:14.740]   Controversy.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.220]   Oh, this is not in a scum.
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:16.700]   No, this is not in a scum.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.980]   I have a Steve on the wrong scooter handle.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.820]   Something about this guy.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.900]   That's many bands.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.080]   He's a band of many members.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.280]   I'm juggling three bands right now.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.880]   Wow.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.880]   Actually four, if I think about it.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:27.400]   Think about it.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.200]   Don't think about it.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:28.840]   That's just four.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.640]   Those guys have been for a really feeling.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.040]   No, that was the band I did the Bowie show with.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.040]   Oh, a Bowie show.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.080]   Should we do the Bowie show?
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.040]   So you only do dead artists now?
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:39.560]   They don't suit you.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.480]   You can do your--
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.520]   We're doing it next year then.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.000]   Well, we're doing a Devo show.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.500]   And there are-- well, most of them are--
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.480]   Devo, Mark Mothers' Baws, Live and Kicking.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.740]   Have you seen Devo?
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.620]   Even lately, they're amazing.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:51.120]   They are.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:51.820]   Amazing live.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:52.740]   That's unbelievable.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.900]   I hear they're still good.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:53.900]   I see them.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.660]   Were the planners on the head still?
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.980]   I've seen them at music festivals,
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:58.980]   and they have the 20-year-old.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.780]   They're like, man, man, I'm so sad.
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:03.860]   And then Devo comes out and just kills.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.980]   And you forget about all the other bands.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.480]   Wow.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.300]   They're unbelievable.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.100]   There's a little tech TV tie into this,
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:13.300]   because when we launched in May of 1998, we had a big party.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.060]   And they wanted a book, the biggest act
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.340]   they could afford it was Devo.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.020]   Wow.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.440]   And the date.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:19.940]   They did.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:20.440]   Oh, no.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.960]   That would be a bad story.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.760]   We wanted you, but they couldn't afford it.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.080]   So we played a tape.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.600]   We played a next tape.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.120]   No, John, my Devo hat is in the kitchen.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.400]   It's actually the mixing bubbles.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.760]   For those of you who don't know,
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.520]   Devo is an American new wave band formed in 1973, 25
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.000]   singles, and nine studio albums.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.640]   I had no idea.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.280]   I said that before.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.760]   And they wear trificones on their hat.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.080]   You'd never heard of Devo?
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:43.920]   No.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.640]   Wait, you never heard of Devo?
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.960]   Are we not a man?
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.060]   That's so--
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.300]   You have a weed on your shirt.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:50.980]   Don't talk to me.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.180]   I do not have a weed on my shirt.
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.620]   That is a palm tree.
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.060]   I'm very confused by that.
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.180]   He missed the pressure that makes sense.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.380]   My wife met someone who didn't know who Bob Marley was.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.060]   Wow.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.980]   And I think Bob Marlar has a larger--
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.500]   I shouldn't tell this story, because my wife's
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.900]   sitting right there.
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:05.900]   Oh, Devo.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.660]   Don't do it, Leo.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.340]   I'm going to send you our single Devo song.
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:08.980]   Are you on spot?
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:09.420]   Tell it?
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.260]   He's saying tell it, so I'm going to do it.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.860]   It's his fault.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:17.320]   So we're going to-- we're going down to meet with an old friend.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.920]   And the friend says, would you mind if Paul Simon joins us
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.400]   for dinner?
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.520]   And I said, no, I mind, no.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:23.880]   I could.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.080]   That'd be cool.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.000]   And I said, I come running in.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.160]   I could barely contain myself.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.400]   I said, to Lisa, I said, Paul Simon's going to be there.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.280]   She said, who?
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.200]   Who's that?
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.280]   It's Paul Simon.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.080]   Yeah?
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.040]   The economist?
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:36.760]   No, no.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.320]   Simon and Garf Uncle.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.880]   Does Garf Uncle mean anything to you?
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.960]   And she said, no, no, not wrecking a bell.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.820]   So I ended up-- I ended up-- this is where Spotify really
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:47.440]   comes in handy.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.160]   I literally played her every Paul Simon and Simon and Garf
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.380]   Uncle's on until I found one.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.220]   Oh, you can call me Alga.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:53.820]   Yes.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:54.820]   OK.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:55.820]   Just me and Julio.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:56.820]   Oh, yes.
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:00.180]   And that guy with the diamonds on the sole of his shoes.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:00.900]   He's going to be there.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.300]   Oh.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:06.060]   Actually, she hit it off with Edie Brekel.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:07.700]   Oh, nice wife, Edie Brekel.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.900]   Yeah, they got along--
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.980]   Are we not friends on gangbuster?
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.680]   There's no economist Paul Simon, but there
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.880]   is a German architect.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.200]   No, no, no, there's Paul Simon.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200]   Who is he?
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.400]   Am I wrong?
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.480]   See, now here she comes.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.160]   I'm in trouble.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:21.960]   Well, fix that.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.800]   He said it.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.560]   He said I should say that story.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.640]   That guy.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.320]   Right there.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.400]   Today we're throwing the whole front row into the bus.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.320]   I told Cal since I made them sit in the front row.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.160]   I said, this isn't school.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.560]   Sit in the front row.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.560]   And now they're sorry.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.640]   Because they thought--
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.080]   I said, this is not a Gallagher show.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.480]   You don't have to wear a Pancho.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.640]   I'm not going to hit a watermelon.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.140]   It would have been a good idea.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.220]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.960]   Google is changing how--
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.160]   OK, explain this to me.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.860]   You probably understand it better than I do.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:57.280]   The ads-- in the past, they've used information
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.700]   that they know about you from search and all that stuff
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.700]   to power Google ads on Google sites.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.100]   But they never did that on third party sites.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.260]   They're about to do that on third party sites, right?
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.580]   Starting today.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.820]   But it is opt-in.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:14.340]   What?
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:15.820]   Who's going to opt-in?
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.540]   Nobody.
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.340]   I am.
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.940]   Because I want better ads.
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:20.420]   But you're--
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.420]   No.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.940]   I've never heard someone say it before.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.660]   That's what I want.
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.100]   I went more of the crap that filled
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:25.740]   the entire row.
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.240]   No, but wait.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:26.900]   I followed it.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.580]   No, you're going to get the ads anyway.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.260]   No, you're not.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.940]   Wouldn't you rather have ads that are something
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.420]   that you're interested in than ads that--
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.580]   I have no ad-blocker guy when I see one.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.980]   And this guy is an ad-blocker guy.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.940]   Because I've used the internet.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.940]   Yes.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:43.700]   Awkward silence.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.220]   It's fine.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:44.740]   But I'll take it.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:45.580]   I'll take the internet.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.940]   No, no, ad-blocking technology is effectively
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.220]   saying that he's stuck with ad that really should be better.
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.500]   Let me explain the silence.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.460]   This house was built with advertising.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:53.940]   I mean, ads.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.900]   I don't block Leos ads.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.220]   You can't block them because they're
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.420]   part of the same file.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.100]   It's part of the same.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:58.500]   Clever.
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   It's part of the same file.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.820]   There's no third party ad blocking.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:01.260]   You'll work.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:01.860]   Amazing, huh?
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.260]   Yet.
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.580]   But let me ask you something.
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:05.060]   OK, I'm here.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.580]   If there were, would you use it on podcasts?
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.580]   No, some things that I like, I support.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.460]   So I turn off ad-blocker for certain sites.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.860]   Lately, I do also use it.
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.060]   I use you block margin.
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.700]   Lately, I have been-- mostly because sites are being really
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:17.540]   annoying about this.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.620]   I have been turning it on.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.700]   I mean, disabling it, I guess, when
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:26.940]   I get to Fortune.com, for instance, they now say, oh, come on, man.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.300]   And Bloomberg and the Guardian.
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:28.820]   Bloomberg.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:29.340]   And everyone.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.500]   But you know what I don't do is Forbes.
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.300]   Because--
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.820]   Well, let's you into the front door anymore,
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.660]   because they're blocker.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.900]   And then you get malware.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:36.940]   So that's not good.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.620]   And I think this is something people overlook,
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:40.500]   is that people don't just run ad-blockers,
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.420]   because they don't like ads.
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.380]   They run ad-blockers, because there's security issues
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:43.860]   with that.
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.700]   Allow a Facebook ads.
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.820]   Now my ads--
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:49.260]   Ad-networks are just lazy ads.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:49.940]   They're bad.
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:51.100]   Yep.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:52.980]   So OK, so anything more to say about this?
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.380]   All I have to say about this is this part of a larger trend
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.540]   where the big companies like Google, Facebook, Apple,
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:02.540]   et cetera, are in the business of building a better user.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.140]   So what they're trying to do over time
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:06.740]   is get you used to more and more cookies back on.
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.300]   Does that sound creepy?
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.740]   We want to build a better user.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.260]   Wait a second.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:11.100]   Script it into this fight.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.300]   In the Frankenstein's head.
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.300]   Yes, exactly.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.380]   Want to build a better user.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:17.260]   So they're methodically going in this direction.
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.700]   But mark my words.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.820]   Three years, there's going to be no opt-in.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.980]   They're just going to do this whole thing all the way.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.820]   And nobody will care.
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:25.780]   That's the real truth.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:26.300]   And that's the real truth.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.500]   That's the real truth.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:31.020]   Is that if they did this without making it out in,
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:31.940]   nobody'd notice either.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:36.980]   I guess there's a new page called My Activity.
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:39.220]   It may or may not be turned on for you.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:42.020]   It's starting to be turned on today.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.340]   It's really interesting because nine to find Google
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:47.260]   said, hey, great news.
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:51.060]   Google's new ad technology is opt-in.
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:56.900]   And then Wired said, uh-oh, Google expands ad tracking.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.500]   So there really is a variation in how people view all of this.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.180]   My attitude is we're going to get ads.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.820]   Wouldn't you rather have ads that are more interest to you?
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.780]   I think we're like a weird--
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:09.420]   we don't count.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.900]   Because I'm searching for so many weird things for work
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.140]   that the ads that are pushed to me.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.540]   And then I used-- I killed all the trackers,
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.820]   all the cookies, and all the money.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:18.660]   It's my position.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.820]   The reason people don't like ad tracking
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:24.460]   is not because it's effective, but because the tools,
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.820]   the recommendations are so crappy that they're creepy.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.260]   They either recommend stuff you just
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:31.020]   bought over and over again.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.460]   Like, I already got those Levi's.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.020]   I don't need to see them anymore.
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:37.900]   But that's just poorly implemented.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.860]   Yeah, I've been recommended some--
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.820]   I bought something on Amazon.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.380]   And then on Facebook, it recommended me--
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:44.740]   Terrible.
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:45.380]   --by that thing.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.380]   I'm like, I just bought it.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:46.820]   I just bought it, dude.
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.820]   But you've got a lot to have in the microwave.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:49.700]   Perhaps.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.940]   After four microwaves, it just goes up.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:55.340]   If you bought a microwave and then it recommended hot pockets,
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.700]   wouldn't that be of interest to you?
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:57.340]   That's true.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:57.940]   No, don't--
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:58.940]   Don't-- don't-- don't--
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:01.900]   I mean, because that would be too much power.
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.140]   I'm just saying that it's not--
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:03.660]   I'm not--
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.660]   It's not ad tracking people don't like--
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:08.620]   if the ad tracking and the recommendation engines worked,
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:10.340]   that people would actually appreciate that.
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.940]   There's also be more--
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.780]   --relevant to you.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.460]   But this is a huge problem.
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.620]   This is the living room with all the data they harvest.
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.420]   They keep harvesting all this data.
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:21.780]   And where are the relevant ads?
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:23.180]   We've been waiting a year after--
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.460]   and they're terrible at it.
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:25.460]   They're horrible at it.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.540]   And that's one problem.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.860]   I think the bigger problem is just a cognitive bias
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:33.380]   against a human being understanding what actually
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:34.780]   happens with the so-called tracking.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:35.580]   There is no tracking.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.500]   There's no committee of conspiratorial people.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.020]   Oh, it's in a sheet.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:38.540]   Whoa, look.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.340]   Look, Alex Wilhelm just did this.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.700]   Like he just bought something and some weed on whatever.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.260]   No, that's not happening.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.100]   That is not happening.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.100]   It's just--
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.140]   We answer--
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:47.660]   We answer--
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.140]   --we answer for more-fies technology.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.460]   Because technology--
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.780]   our brains are designed to act on human interactions.
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.460]   We don't have the biology for--
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:59.260]   But that data, if it's in a--
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.660]   I mean, if they can't even--
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:03.580]   the malware, if that's insecure, then the data that's
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.380]   being held somewhere--
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:06.300]   Who's protecting that?
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.300]   Yeah, who's protecting that data?
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:08.660]   That's my concern.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.780]   It's the sort of like--
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.020]   What are your words that's going to happen, though?
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.260]   Well, they can track where you go, what you're doing,
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:15.620]   what you're buying.
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.740]   And then that just builds a more robust system
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.460]   to help them hack you.
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.380]   Everything-- every little bit of information
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:25.820]   that you put out there is more information
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:26.820]   that you can use to--
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:28.500]   I know that you have a chiquita banana sticker
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.660]   on your camera, for instance.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.580]   Alex, you do not.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:33.260]   I do not.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:33.780]   I don't think--
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:33.780]   I don't think--
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.540]   I'm going to hack makes.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.220]   I'm pretty boring.
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.580]   So I don't really worry about it too much.
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:37.180]   So you're--
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.540]   But are you really-- why are you so boring?
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.500]   I also report on security.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:41.700]   So I get--
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:42.860]   That does make you a target.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.420]   Yeah, it makes my Google account,
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:47.940]   I get about three alerts a month that someone's
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:48.580]   trying to hack it.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:49.220]   I get that.
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.580]   I get spearfishing from my--
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.180]   I think a lot of people have been getting a lot of spearfishing
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.220]   from Twitter lately.
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.020]   Yep.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.620]   That but my Google account gets hit.
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.660]   That would be a Twitter tweet directed at you with--
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.180]   It's an email.
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:01.460]   --the download that's aimed at you.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.540]   It's an email that says--
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.340]   Oh, there's something wrong from Twitter.
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:04.900]   From Twitter.
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:05.740]   From Twitter.
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:06.660]   Yeah, right.
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.660]   That says, oh, there's some weirdness going on
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.500]   with your account.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.380]   And you say that spearfishing because you think it's targeted
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:12.300]   at Roberto Baldwin.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.820]   Yeah, because they-- well, the funny thing
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:15.860]   is they send it to the wrong email address.
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:16.660]   So you know it's--
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.160]   Oh, no.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:17.860]   --it's really funny.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:20.340]   Because they send it to robertobaldwin@mac.com,
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:21.860]   which doesn't go anywhere.
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.100]   It's a real address, but it's not anything you've ever used
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:25.100]   to do.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.100]   But nothing is attached to it.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.100]   Did you just give away one of your actual emails?
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.100]   Yeah, just on to it.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.100]   I just love that idea.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:29.100]   That's the one email.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:29.860]   Send me some emails.
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:30.380]   I don't care.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:30.880]   Whoo.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.060]   All right, that's dangerous.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:32.740]   Leo, report it.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:33.260]   I love it.
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:34.020]   Well, my email--
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:34.940]   I mean, my email is--
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:36.220]   I'm Mike Elgin on gmail.com.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.820]   That's fantastic.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:40.340]   I used to make light of the broader, like,
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:41.300]   worry about hacking thing.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.060]   But my voicemail got hacked once.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.060]   And that was a really huge pain.
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.620]   Somebody actually hacked into my voicemail
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.220]   and changed my voicemail recording
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:49.100]   so that I had left.
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.100]   Then the next would have been joined in gadget.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.500]   And I thought it was my then girlfriend called me.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:54.540]   I was like, oh, do you leave your job?
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:58.980]   And almost certainly, that prank is somebody who knows you.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.500]   If I find them, we're going to have a chat.
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:03.420]   But it is, because they knew enough about you to do that.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:03.920]   It's a war.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.260]   Right?
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.020]   They knew you.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:06.420]   And then you go ahead and set up my voicemail
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:07.420]   yet when I moved to Verizon.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.580]   So it was insecure.
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.260]   Oops, classic news.
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:09.780]   I guess you moved.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:12.460]   I guess one point is that there's
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.900]   nothing you can do to prevent hacking, really.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.060]   If you're targeted--
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.820]   If somebody says, I want to get Roberto, they're going to get you.
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:20.940]   Yeah, if I'm targeted by a nation state,
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.940]   or by a group of hackers--
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.940]   But what Kevin Roosted our--
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.940]   If Lizard Squad wants to do it, wants to have--
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.940]   They're going to get to me.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.580]   What I'm trying to do is--
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:33.580]   Lower your surface.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.940]   It's like when someone-- a thief is walking down the street
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:36.380]   and they're--
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.820]   You don't need every door knob.
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:39.500]   And they're like, one of these is unlocking.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.020]   This is the one.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.020]   You know how I break in.
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:42.500]   You're cursed on the front seat.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.700]   You put it in the trunk.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:44.220]   I take it.
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:44.940]   And we all do that.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.620]   But if Lizard Squad wants to get me,
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:48.220]   or if--
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:48.660]   Do you understand?
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.260]   --a nation, Korea, China, Russia.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.100]   Yeah, anybody with a lot--
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.180]   If your target, you--
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.180]   I guess we are going to have to worry a little bit more
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:00.340]   about casual, kind of malicious hacking.
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:03.780]   Why is it even worse, though?
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.580]   Why has there not been more systemic internet-wide
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.660]   disasters of privacy?
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:10.020]   I feel like it's usually constrained to target customers.
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.020]   Here's my guess.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:11.820]   It's an X and X.
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:16.300]   My guess is it's happening a lot for high profile subjects.
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:19.180]   And of course, if it happens to you, the last thing you guys
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.860]   are journalists, you're going to write about it.
[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:23.020]   But the last thing Scarlett Johansson is going to do
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.980]   is talk about it in any form of fashion.
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:30.020]   Her experts are saying, don't--
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:30.820]   I've seen--
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:34.220]   --all Cogan, Justin Bieber, Scarlett Johansson,
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.380]   a bunch of celebrities, social security numbers.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.060]   Just freely available on the dark hand.
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:42.380]   And they can change it, but it's not easy to change it.
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:43.780]   And well, they have people who--
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.340]   that's their entire job is to make sure they know
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.740]   that their information is out there
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.820]   to keep everything they have secure.
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.740]   And so you're just constantly changing phone numbers
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:52.740]   or constantly changing--
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:56.460]   I would love to talk to somebody who is a major celebrity,
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:57.780]   a major--
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:01.340]   and I'd like to put this out to anybody who wants to volunteer.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:04.660]   But as Stephen Fry or somebody who's just a major celebrity,
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.620]   you know what would be interesting to talk to is Neil
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.540]   Gaiman, because he's well-known among geeks.
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.740]   He's a geek icon.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.740]   And ask them, what do you do?
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:19.100]   Because for sure, there's some 18-year-old geek
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.740]   who's attacking you constantly, right?
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.780]   And what does it cost you?
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.500]   How much effort do you put into it?
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.820]   What do you do?
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:27.380]   I'm sure--
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:30.380]   I think I know there are firms that do this.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.020]   I've been told there are firms that do this.
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:33.180]   I've been told that there are firms
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.580]   that you can hire at great cost who
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:40.020]   will track the hacker down, who will actually--
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:43.140]   you know, a counter hacker working on your behalf
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:45.620]   that will, more effectively, probably because they're
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.500]   willing to break the law, more effectively,
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:52.140]   track down the miscreant and threaten to break their legs.
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.140]   I think that you can pay for that.
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:54.660]   I'm sure.
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.420]   But then there's what Roberto brought up,
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:59.180]   which is that everything's in the cloud now.
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.700]   So a lot of the hacks we hear about,
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:03.260]   we don't really see the consequences in a big way.
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:06.220]   But you hear that some hospital system--
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:07.140]   Right.
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.220]   --or insurance company, or any-- all the government agencies
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.940]   have been hacked by the Chinese and Russians and so on.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:16.380]   But if everything's in the cloud, which brings us around
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.340]   to, I think, is always an interesting conversation,
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.860]   does Apple do what they say and is what they say they do
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:23.620]   the right way to go?
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.820]   Keep all the information on the phone
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.300]   and interest in sending the cloud.
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.740]   That's the new question that we're all
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:31.060]   going to be asking after WWDC and the announcements
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.820]   about differential privacy and on-device.
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:37.500]   Apple wants to use information about you,
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:40.940]   but they think or assert that they could do it privately.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.580]   But that's marketing speak.
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:44.940]   They will, at some point, Apple always does do a white paper,
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:46.860]   which might be more forthcoming.
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.620]   Apple wants us to keep more of our phones,
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.180]   and yet still sell 16 gigabyte options.
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:52.740]   Right.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.340]   Well, they may not do that in the next phone.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:56.740]   There's a rumor they're going to start at 32.
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:57.940]   That would be lovely.
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:58.980]   But do you think it's going to happen?
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:19:59.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:19:59.900]   OK.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:00.340]   It is.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.460]   That's your dollar.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.460]   Oh, the inadequate one, though, is--
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:04.740]   I told you it was gambling.
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.420]   Pinky bet.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:06.020]   There we go.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:07.100]   Pinky bet.
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:07.620]   Is that bad?
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.700]   Is that binding?
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.420]   Yeah, I believe that's a legally binding pink.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:11.420]   In the United States.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:13.060]   Because it's also been recorded.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:13.660]   So you have a--
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:14.100]   Oh, we have a--
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:14.940]   --of videos on, right?
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:14.940]   Yeah.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.740]   You should take a picture, Michael.
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.900]   Yeah, and you took a photo.
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.700]   Like the people in that room saw.
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:21.900]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.460]   Anyway, now you're worried about that dollar, aren't you?
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:25.740]   No, I'm like, what am I saying?
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.460]   You're asking it.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:28.500]   I just remember there was somebody like O'Donnell
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:32.500]   in the audience when Tim Cook and Bono did their fake--
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.020]   E.T.
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:34.340]   --finger touch.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:37.980]   And that had became an image that will never, never go away.
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:38.620]   Sadly.
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:41.380]   And now it's you and me and Pinky's baby.
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.020]   Because we're just as handsome and wealthy.
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:43.820]   Yes.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:44.980]   And people care as much.
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:46.380]   True.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:47.620]   Also equally untrue.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.100]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.140]   But anyway, to a certain extent, the worst case scenario
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:53.420]   for Apple, just to zip this up, is
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:56.420]   the pandering to the public ignorance about stuff.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:57.660]   It's in my hands.
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.860]   Therefore, it's secure.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.940]   Well, no, unless I leave this in the taxi or whatever.
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.500]   No, well, I'm not giving you an example.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.780]   Everybody knows if they read between the lines that Apple
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:09.820]   has the key to your iCloud storage.
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:16.020]   And if asked by law enforcement by duly ordained--
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:16.780]   I guess it's not our--
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:17.280]   Or dang.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:17.780]   Oh, dang.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.580]   It's a law enforcement.
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:19.460]   It's a word of that.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:19.900]   It's a word of that.
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:21.980]   Law enforcement, if the right people ask,
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.980]   they will give your iCloud contents to--
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.420]   Well, here's another way to look at it.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:29.820]   But they act as if that's not the case.
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:30.340]   Right.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:33.500]   No, they said that they've been very public about that.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.020]   I've been on calls with them.
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:35.540]   You've talked to them.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.940]   They say they will give it over.
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:38.740]   And they've--
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.700]   Well, the first time I heard them say that publicly
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.980]   was in the San Bernardino case, where they said--
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.620]   and they felt a little self-serving--
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:47.980]   hey, had the FBI only asked us and not changed the password,
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.940]   we would have just said back it up to the iCloud
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.060]   and we'll give it to you.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.500]   Well, that was also the FBI.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.700]   That was very self-serving.
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.100]   Don't even talk about the FBI's.
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.420]   So, but technical advice.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.540]   But I think the general populace--
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:02.540]   I doesn't know that when you back up your phone to iCloud,
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.420]   you're giving the entire contents of the phone
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:05.380]   and cryptid or not.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:05.980]   Yep.
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:08.900]   To Apple, which can then and will then give it
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:09.940]   to law enforcement if asked.
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:10.860]   Well, then there's--
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.420]   Or it could be a speculation that they're not--
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.020]   After all, isn't that where Scarlett Johansson's--
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.940]   Because they encrypt it because they have the keys
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:17.740]   to that encryption in the iCloud.
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.900]   But there's speculation that they're not
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:20.780]   going to have the key anymore.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.340]   They're going to do the same thing on the phone.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.140]   They're going to swallow it.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:23.900]   Believe me.
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.180]   When they do that, they will announce that.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:26.940]   Oh, yes.
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.860]   Because it's a huge publicity way for them.
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:31.860]   And I thought they might announce something at WWDC.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:34.980]   And to me, the fact that they did not
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.500]   tells me that Apple's trying to have it both ways,
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:41.460]   that they want-- look, it's also bad PR
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.580]   with a lot of the American public to say, oh, we're not
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.820]   going to help you in your investigation against terrorism.
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:45.900]   Right.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.660]   Because hashtag freedom.
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.460]   So I think Apple wants it both ways.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.500]   I think they want general consumer--
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.060]   exactly as you said, they're kind of oppositioning it.
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.340]   They want the perception to be that they're protecting you.
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:58.460]   They also want it to be clear to law enforcement
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.780]   and anybody paying attention that, in fact, if law enforcement
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.060]   needs it.
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:02.860]   And you know what?
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.700]   You may even say-- and I think a lot of the public says,
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.660]   no, no, that's fine.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:08.740]   If the FBI asks, you should stand and deliver.
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.060]   But what people don't get is, well, if that's the case,
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:14.060]   it also means that that is less secure for a bad guy,
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:19.220]   that somebody misbehaving employee at Apple
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:21.980]   might have access to that and hackers might have access.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.940]   And in fact, that is what happened
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:26.140]   with the naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:27.580]   That was a fishing campaign.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:31.060]   But they got in through-- those were iCloud-stored photos,
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:31.260]   right?
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.580]   Yeah, because they fished them.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:33.500]   Well, we don't know exactly.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:33.980]   No, they did.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:34.620]   We found out.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:35.620]   It was a fishing campaign.
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:36.300]   Yeah, all right.
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.260]   It was just a special engineering campaign.
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.620]   Because I thought some of it might have been social engineering.
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:43.100]   Yeah, but I mean, I thought it was calling Apple reps
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:47.420]   and getting some information from them and maybe not.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:48.900]   Matt Honan's hack was a fishing--
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:49.980]   That was a fishing campaign.
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:50.940]   That was social engineering.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.820]   That was Apple Amazon.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:53.340]   Right.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:55.260]   They used a social engineering with Apple
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:56.780]   and Amazon to collate information.
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.980]   It was super easy because we had to do research.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:00.140]   But Apple changed it.
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.420]   And Amazon changed it, they say.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.220]   But that's my point.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:07.500]   You say if Apple can see the data, if Dropbox can see the data,
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.420]   it doesn't-- yes, they can say, well, we're only
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.620]   going to hand it over to law enforcement.
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:14.260]   But in fact, it makes it less secure.
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.540]   Right, exactly.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.260]   And one of the things that helps you understand Apple's
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.780]   decision-making processes, they are very, very good,
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:23.620]   and almost unique in the industry,
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.620]   at looking at the long game on every single aspect.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:28.380]   They look ahead in the future, and they--
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:29.860]   I guarantee you, they have meetings,
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.900]   and they say, OK, they're going to be large numbers
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.820]   of really, really horrible hacks where lots and lots of data.
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:36.820]   What are we going to say?
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:37.940]   Yeah, what will be your response?
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:38.740]   OK, that's scenario one.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.060]   We need to be ready for that.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:41.340]   And then there's another scenario.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:43.180]   There's going to be horrible terrorist attacks
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:46.540]   where catching the bad guys going to involve using a phone.
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.820]   What are we going to say?
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.380]   So they have a story for both of those.
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:51.300]   The story on the one hand is that they ask for it,
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.700]   and it's illegal, and it's a warrant.
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.620]   We give it to them, give it anything.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:56.620]   The other thing is, oh, we don't put things in the cloud.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:57.380]   The cloud's dangerous.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.740]   We keep everything on the phone and secure, you know, all that.
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.820]   That's their story for that.
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:03.660]   But they're looking, and they know events will take place
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:06.060]   that will put them in the spotlight at some point.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.220]   Meanwhile, what's the most secure device that
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:10.700]   is generally available to consumers?
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:12.060]   It's a Chromebook.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:13.300]   It's all cloud.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:13.780]   Right.
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.860]   And that's super, super secure, because Google is super secure.
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:17.940]   And by the way, I'd like to--
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:21.060]   speaking of Google Plus's fifth year anniversary,
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.300]   I'm glad Sundar Pichai got hacked on Twitter and Quora.
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:28.060]   Because he's been using Twitter instead of his own Google Plus.
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:29.700]   And has Google Plus ever been hacked?
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:30.700]   No.
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:31.700]   People got a reason to--
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.700]   Is it Google Plus?
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.700]   We know it.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.940]   Do we know if Google-- I mean, it might have been hacked.
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:35.940]   Who cares?
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:39.260]   There's never been that false post in Sundar Pichai's account
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:39.940]   or more.
[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.420]   Well, someone hacks your email account.
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:44.660]   They have access to your--
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:45.540]   So we know how--
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:45.980]   So it has been hacked.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:46.820]   They just don't care.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:50.020]   We know how Sundar got hacked, and we know how Quora got hacked.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.700]   Third party apps that had been given permission
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:53.940]   to post on their behalf.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.860]   So we never used third party apps.
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:56.380]   That's--
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:57.780]   That was a third party app.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.300]   That's a third party app.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.620]   But somebody hacked a third party app.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:02.780]   They had permission to post on their Twitter account
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:03.540]   and then use that--
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.900]   Of which they're an on for Google Plus.
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.820]   And we've been suffering from the lack of third party
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:07.860]   in a little way.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.020]   So it's secure because they don't allow that.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:10.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.420]   This happened to me recently, actually.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:13.940]   A tweet went out from my account
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.620]   from the official four square service.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.820]   That was like Garbledygook.
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:19.180]   And so I was like, I haven't used four squares since I was 14.
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:19.900]   I've had that happen too.
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:20.980]   And so I was very confused.
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.300]   So we went through it to my Twitter account
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:24.100]   and tried to undo third party app access.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.260]   And over the years--
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:29.580]   It was like 150 things that were a lot of close from my account.
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:30.780]   I killed all of them.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:31.620]   That's terrifying.
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:34.900]   That is, by the way, the moral of that Cinder Pachart story,
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:37.580]   which is you should go through Facebook and Twitter
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.460]   and look at the app permissions and kill those apps.
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.300]   Anything that you don't see.
[01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:42.100]   It's not you should use Google Plus.
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:42.580]   It's the other one.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:43.080]   No, sadly.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.260]   No one's given that advice ever.
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:44.740]   It's checking.
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.660]   I think that you can't pack Google Plus in the back
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.020]   and say how secure it is because they don't allow right access
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.300]   to third party apps.
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.140]   I think the CEO of a company should
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.260]   use his to eat his own dog food.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:53.500]   Should use that.
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:54.420]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:55.900]   Well, finding Zuckerberg should use Friendfish.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:58.020]   I mean, his dog food, he should eat it too.
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:58.300]   That's all.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:01.900]   Incidentally, a story that came out a couple of days ago
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.460]   on the full disk encryption in Android.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.580]   Most Android phones now are encrypted by default.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.380]   All of them equals are.
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:12.500]   However, it turns out-- and by the way, this post was complicated
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.940]   and somewhat above my pay grade.
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.660]   But according to this post, and I haven't seen anything
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:20.740]   to contradict it, they figured out
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:24.900]   how using a flaw in the way Qualcomm enables
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:27.420]   a secure store in the encryption.
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:31.340]   And there is a way, not an easy way, but there is a way.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:35.180]   If you understand this chart, you too can crack.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.620]   Then you are Steve Gibson.
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.060]   And you can't.
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:38.060]   There's always a way.
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:38.660]   There's always a way.
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:40.460]   Well, people are like, well, our software is secure.
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:42.220]   But yeah, but is your hardware secure?
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.580]   Are you building your own hardware?
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.500]   There's always a way.
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:45.300]   Two apples credit.
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:47.500]   You can say there isn't a way to break apples
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.780]   into full disk encryption.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:51.860]   Or guess we know there is because the FBI got help, right?
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:52.300]   Is there?
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.100]   I don't know.
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:53.700]   Well, yeah.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:54.300]   I'm going to say I can do it.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:56.860]   Everything-- yeah, the NSA is supposed to--
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:57.620]   Apples done everything.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.780]   They've been writing about how they've had it.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:59.580]   If you want to work with the FBI.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.780]   If you read this article, it does compare
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:06.420]   how Apple stores the encryption key versus how Google does it.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:11.460]   And Apple does seem to have a better scheme than Google's
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:11.820]   scheme.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.860]   This is Apple's scheme involving something
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.340]   called entanglement.
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.780]   Sounds complicated.
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:20.980]   It tangles your password with another thing.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:22.940]   It's like an episode of Game of Thrones.
[01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.020]   I don't think so.
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:24.940]   What to tangle with?
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.340]   Battle of the entanglement.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:26.980]   Let's take a break.
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:29.820]   I want to talk about the new Facebook feed.
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.340]   I might have buried the lead.
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:33.260]   There's actually some very big stories
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.260]   that we didn't talk about, including, of course,
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:36.780]   the fifth anniversary of Google Plus.
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:37.780]   Yeah, that's a huge story.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.180]   Cannot, cannot forget.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:40.980]   I cannot forget that.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:41.860]   I want to talk about that.
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.540]   I'm talking, of course, about the Tesla fatality.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.740]   Yes.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:47.260]   And lots more.
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:49.540]   And this little public service announcement,
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:52.820]   whatever you do, don't eat gas station, Nuke.
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:55.460]   Our show today brought to you by BrainTree.
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:59.620]   BrainTree is the solution for the mobile app developer
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:03.020]   who wants to add payment to their apps.
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:05.700]   I think if you're writing a mobile app
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:08.100]   and you know you want to have customers use your app
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.220]   to buy things, to pay for things,
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.740]   there's a couple of ways to address this.
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:14.300]   One would be to write a full-stack solution yourself.
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.740]   I think if you're a developer, you know.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.460]   And that's not the right way to do it.
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:20.860]   Not only is it hard to do, it's hard to do right
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:22.740]   unless you're really an expert.
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:25.420]   And even then, it's a pain because then somebody
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:26.460]   adds a new form of payment.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:28.980]   You got to go back in the code and write the whole thing.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:30.580]   So what you're probably going to want to do
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.340]   is go out and look and see what other people use.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.060]   You might check, for instance, well, you know,
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.300]   what's the best payment experience out there?
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:37.380]   Uber, right?
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:37.900]   It's great.
[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:39.380]   You get out of the car, you're done.
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:40.780]   So what does Uber use, you might ask?
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:41.740]   Or what does Lyft use?
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:44.100]   Maybe you use GitHub, of course you do.
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.260]   What does GitHub that they, these guys are smart?
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.180]   What would they use?
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:48.740]   What would Airbnb hotels tonight?
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:49.580]   You know what?
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:51.060]   The answer is the same in every case.
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:54.460]   All of those services, CASPER and boxed,
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:58.860]   and everybody use brain tree.
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.940]   You know, viable pins on Pinterest.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:01.740]   This is amazing.
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.340]   This is everywhere.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.780]   It's brain tree.
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.820]   Brain tree payments, because it's a full-stack solution,
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.820]   a few lines of code you can easily integrate.
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:09.860]   They keep it up to date.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:11.540]   They're security experts.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:14.100]   You don't have to worry about fraud.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:16.940]   They've got full-time fraud protection built in.
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:19.340]   Your customers like it because they've used it before.
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:20.460]   They know it's safe.
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.300]   And when there's a new form of payment, it's easy.
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:24.820]   You flip a switch, you just click the box in your control
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:29.340]   panel and you put the new app out and boom, you're done.
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.380]   Just update a few little things and you're done.
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:36.660]   From pounds to PayPal, from Bitcoin to credit cards,
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:38.580]   brain tree does it all.
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.580]   In iOS and Android and JavaScript,
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:42.540]   that means you can use it on the web too.
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:46.020]   .NET, node.js, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.820]   It is the best.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:50.700]   I don't know if you're the decision maker in your team,
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:54.420]   but please bring this to the one who does.
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:57.420]   Program manager, your boss, whoever, your product manager.
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.860]   Braintreepayments.com/twit.
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:02.060]   And if they need a little more incentive, tell them,
[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:05.900]   oh, and by the way, your first $50,000 in payments are fee-free.
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:06.700]   It's the best way.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:07.540]   That's why everybody uses it.
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:14.540]   Braintreepayments.com/twit to find out more.
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:19.540]   It's such a sad story.
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:23.580]   I don't want to make fun of the story in any way,
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:26.500]   but I do think this is, as far as I know,
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:29.100]   correct me if I wrong, the first time an autonomous vehicle
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:30.100]   has killed a passenger.
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:31.060]   Was it an autonomous vehicle?
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.060]   It's semi-autonomous because it's autopilot.
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:35.300]   So you're supposed to be in the driver
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:37.900]   is supposed to be in charge of the vehicle at all times.
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.100]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:40.860]   You're not supposed to be watching Harry Potter, I mean.
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:43.620]   Yeah, Tesla Model S.
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:45.220]   It was a very challenging situation,
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:47.860]   whether you're a human or a machine.
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.340]   Cruising down the highway, we know
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.540]   because he blew by a few other people who reported
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.060]   he was going at least 85 miles an hour,
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.020]   which is over the speed limit in that area.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:04.260]   He, a tractor trailer, made a left turn across the freeway,
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:05.980]   and it was white.
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:07.540]   And according to Tesla's records,
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:13.820]   neither the driver nor the autopilot could see it.
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.300]   The brake was not applied.
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:18.900]   The car hit the tractor trailer at full speed.
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:21.780]   And it was an unusual situation for an autopilot
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:23.900]   because the tractor, as many trucks, in fact,
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:25.060]   this is against the law in Europe,
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:27.740]   I'm told they have to put baffles at the bottom of the truck.
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:29.620]   This truck was very high off the road.
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.500]   That's why they do that.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:31.340]   Okay.
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:33.540]   So yeah, that's why they do that so that you can see it.
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:36.940]   So what it looked like perhaps to the autopilot is a sign
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.700]   because it could see road,
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.580]   and then there's something blocking it.
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:43.020]   That's pure speculation on my part.
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.140]   But for whatever reason, maybe it was the light Tesla
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:47.140]   in their blog post said that it was a white truck,
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.780]   it was a bright sunny day.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.300]   Whatever reason, the brake was never applied.
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:56.020]   The car hit the truck and the passenger was immediately killed.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.620]   Chilling effect on autonomous vehicles or?
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.340]   No.
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:32:59.900]   The opposite.
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.780]   Business as usual.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:01.300]   The opposite.
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:01.780]   The opposite.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:02.980]   Here's why.
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:06.180]   Look at all the information that Tesla has about what happened.
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:06.540]   Okay.
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:07.220]   I know it's amazing.
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.100]   They know everything.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:10.860]   As we know with software in general and open source software,
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:13.300]   in particular, if you're constantly refining,
[01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.660]   getting data in a good way, in a meaningful way,
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:17.340]   and refining what you do,
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:20.420]   this is how self-driving cars ultimately
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:22.780]   will be essentially perfected.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:25.460]   Because this is something that we've never had.
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.300]   Nobody wants to be the one that died.
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:28.300]   Well, no.
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:29.500]   To make the self-driving car better.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.260]   But no one to be the one who died when, you know,
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.620]   before we had anti-lock brakes or no one had to be the one
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:36.140]   to die before we started using the seat belt.
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:37.540]   And they were fast against mandatory and so on.
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.020]   This was clearly the driver's error.
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.660]   He was not supposed to be watching movies.
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:42.460]   He was supposed to be watching what he was doing.
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:44.460]   To be fair, we don't know he was watching movies.
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:47.460]   The truck driver reported he heard the Harry Potter movie
[01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:49.740]   playing when he went back to see what was going on.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.180]   Not a bad signal that it was playing.
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:55.100]   But I mean, you know, I don't want to impugen the driver.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.580]   And he had eight tickets and blah, blah, blah.
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:57.940]   I don't want to impugen the driver.
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:58.940]   He just did.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:01.460]   Why don't you want to impugen the driver?
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.140]   I mean, besides the fact that he's dead.
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:07.580]   I mean, if you're driving a car and the brakes should be applied
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:09.060]   to avoid hitting something,
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:11.660]   it's your responsibility as a driver to apply those brakes.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:12.460]   He didn't.
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:13.460]   He didn't.
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:15.460]   Because he trusted the car.
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.780]   Oh, admittedly made a mistake trusting the car.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:21.340]   But they've been very forthcoming, do not trust the car.
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:24.820]   And especially if this person was a Tesla enthusiast saying,
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:28.740]   right, you know, he actually posted a video to show how well
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:31.340]   the autopilot did.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:35.460]   Tesla says, oh no, in fact, they have a lot of mechanical
[01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:36.020]   restrictions.
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.980]   You have to keep your hand on the wheel and blah, blah, blah.
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.180]   We're going to slow down.
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:40.620]   But a lot of that feels like Lee Lee's.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:43.940]   Like we got an autonomous vehicle.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:44.940]   Don't trust it.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:47.020]   Whatever you do.
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:48.340]   It's semi-autonomous.
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.180]   There's a difference.
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:50.180]   I understand.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:50.820]   To me, this falls--
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:53.300]   But don't you think that scares people now because I'm
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.980]   thinking, but that's going to happen to me.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:58.580]   See here, I'll tell you why it's your main and why
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:00.020]   I don't want to impugen the driver.
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:02.980]   Because the truth is, most people say,
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:05.220]   I think autonomous vehicles are great for the other guys
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:07.700]   because they're crap drivers.
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.660]   I am an excellent driver.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:10.220]   I--
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.180]   Cognitive bias.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.620]   That guy was a crap driver.
[01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:13.820]   Of course he died.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.820]   But I am an excellent driver.
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:18.100]   So I am not going to trust an autonomous vehicle
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:19.300]   because I'm a better driver than that.
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:23.260]   That Leo is why we need to get to actual self-driving cars.
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:26.140]   Stop farting around with semi-autonomous--
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.140]   because no, because people are delusional.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:29.100]   That's why we can't trust--
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.980]   Is there anybody here who is not an excellent driver?
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:33.140]   I'm a bad driver.
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:34.940]   OK, I'm pointing at the teenager in the crash.
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:36.300]   There's a consensus that's right.
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.780]   Yeah, we know teenagers are bad drivers.
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.740]   They should be in it.
[01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:42.780]   Are you an excellent driver?
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:44.100]   I think you're an excellent driver.
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:46.900]   My auto-journalist friends say I'm an excellent driver.
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:47.740]   Yeah, he's got it.
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:50.180]   So that's my auto-analix excellent driver?
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:50.980]   I know.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:51.540]   I'm terrible.
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:52.380]   I don't pay attention at all.
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:53.420]   I'm just thinking about other things
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:54.500]   and seeing along with my own stuff.
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.860]   You know you're a bad driver.
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:57.900]   I stopped driving for a reason.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:58.180]   I was like--
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.020]   Oh, you don't drive?
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.660]   Well, I haven't been really in like seven, eight years.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:01.820]   Oh, well, OK.
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.300]   Because I don't like it.
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:04.020]   It's very annoying.
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:04.860]   So let me put it this way.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.220]   Anybody who's still driving thinks
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:07.260]   you're an excellent driver.
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:08.180]   Thank God for Uber, by the way.
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:09.540]   Are you an excellent driver?
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:12.220]   I'm probably a very safe driver.
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:14.260]   My wife tells me that I drive too slowly and stuff.
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:15.780]   My wife is an excellent driver.
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:17.420]   But I don't want to be driving.
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:18.940]   I want to be taking an app and playing video games.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:19.460]   I do too.
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.860]   But will you now, looking at this, think, gosh,
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:24.300]   I hope no white trucks drive across the road?
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:24.900]   No.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:25.940]   We're talking about--
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:29.420]   I mean, full autonomy is 10 years out into the future.
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:32.020]   Right now, we're just doing baby steps.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.500]   The problem with what happened here
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.660]   is that it's the nightly news.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:38.900]   The nightly news keeps saying, autonomous driver kills man.
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:40.860]   And that's the--
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:42.260]   That's the news.
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:43.420]   The people are going to head, right?
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:43.940]   It's not true.
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:44.420]   It's not true.
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:45.420]   That's not true.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.020]   Well, first of all--
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.500]   Man who doesn't put brakes on when he goes barreling towards--
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.340]   No, because the car was in charge.
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:51.580]   No, you're in charge.
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:53.100]   It tells you.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.260]   And also, there's another cognitive bias going on,
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:59.340]   which is that how many people are killed by other people?
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:01.500]   Well, Tesla pointed at this in a blog post.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:02.780]   They have driven--
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:07.380]   Teslas have driven, cumulatively, 130 million autonomous--
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:07.940]   No, millions.
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:08.460]   It was million.
[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:09.460]   130 million.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:10.580]   Autonomous miles with--
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.060]   With all their cars.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.980]   This is the first fatality.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:17.220]   They point out that in the US, that number is 96 million
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:19.220]   per miles' fatality.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:21.420]   And in the rest of the world, it's 60 because--
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:22.260]   It's already safer.
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:23.780]   In America, we're excellent drivers.
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:25.500]   But in the rest of the world, they're crap-drowned.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:26.300]   No, no, no, no.
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:26.940]   60 million.
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:28.980]   They're better drivers abroad, but what they don't have
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:30.260]   is six lane highways.
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:31.460]   They have two lanes.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:33.660]   And you'll have to pass in the oncoming traffic.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:34.780]   No, they're crap drivers.
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:35.300]   OK.
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:38.300]   Have you ever seen how those other guys drive?
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:38.940]   Altru.
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:42.060]   Leo, you're about to get invaded by the EU.
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:43.460]   Also, I wanted to apologize.
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:45.380]   It was 130 million, not 130,000.
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:45.860]   It's a lot.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.820]   I was incorrect by a factor of 1,000.
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.540]   Well, we corrected you already, but thank you.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:50.860]   No, this is my formal apology.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:52.180]   I've fact checked you.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:53.620]   Apologized to the numbers.
[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:54.260]   I did.
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:55.420]   But that's an important point.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:56.740]   And in fact, somebody else told me
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:58.580]   when I was telling this story on the radio.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:02.140]   And also, in the weekend that's gone by since we heard this story,
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.020]   how many people have died on American highways?
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:05.460]   Thousands, literally.
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:08.140]   I think it's 36,000-- 36,000 a year.
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:10.820]   So this is going to get all the attention,
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:14.300]   even though many,000 more have died because they drove into it.
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:16.780]   That's why we must speak out as we're doing so here today.
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:17.820]   In favor of autonomy.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:20.900]   Leo, speak out in favor of autonomy, even semi-autonomy.
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:23.100]   Aren't you going to be really scared when you get in that car
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:23.780]   and it drives?
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:23.900]   Terrified.
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:24.740]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:25.260]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:27.820]   Are you not going to sweat and hold your hand over the--
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:29.700]   Well, unless you should be doing right now.
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:30.300]   Right.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:30.780]   No.
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:31.780]   You know what Google says?
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:34.300]   We're not going to put a gas pedal, a brake pedal, or a steering wheel.
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:34.740]   Oh, yes they will.
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:36.500]   Well, they know why?
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:40.860]   Because most of the time, when the driver takes over, they blow it.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:41.340]   They--
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:41.820]   Yeah, well.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.100]   They won't be allowed to do that.
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:43.820]   Yeah, right now.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:45.140]   State of California will require us to--
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:47.060]   But again, in 10 years, Robbie's point,
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:49.100]   this is going to be amazing, awesome, and I can't wait.
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:49.620]   Yeah.
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.340]   To me, the future here is relatively obvious,
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:52.180]   and that's exciting.
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:53.340]   Like, it's actually really stoked.
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:54.980]   You won't own one.
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:56.900]   Car ownership will be like boat ownership.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.660]   Like, you have to be rich, enthusiast, and all that stuff.
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:01.260]   And you know, there'll be cheap, and you just--
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.660]   I don't think that's a bad world.
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:03.020]   I think you're bad.
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:03.500]   I think--
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.140]   Yeah, it's a great world, yeah.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:05.980]   I love driving.
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:08.180]   I despise commuting.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:11.380]   I'm happy to drive outside the city and the mountains.
[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:15.740]   And I think that's where most of the Tesla autonomous miles
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:18.180]   are in stop and go traffic, because it does--
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:20.060]   it will handle that quite well.
[01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:23.060]   Freeways are super-- well, not super easy.
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:24.460]   Freeways are easier.
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:25.780]   It's in the city.
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:26.860]   It's surface streets.
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:29.340]   That's where it's going to be super difficult for them.
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.620]   And when you have everything coming at you--
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.500]   When all vehicles are autonomous, it will be much.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.540]   The truck, for instance, would not have made that turn.
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:39.220]   And had it made that turn, it would have somehow
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:42.020]   communicated, presumably, to other vehicles in the area.
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:44.420]   Hey, I'm stuck across the lane here.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:45.860]   Don't run into me.
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:48.660]   All autonomous would solve this also, right?
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.820]   And complete and networked capability
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:53.420]   of all the vehicles on the road to presume in your model.
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.220]   But I totally agree.
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:55.460]   I mean, when all the cars can talk to each other
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:57.020]   and say, here's my GPS coordinates,
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:59.300]   I can see you, you can see me, we can talk,
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.820]   you have to really mess it up to maybe spearfish it
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:03.260]   to use your earlier term.
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:04.700]   Really hack at it to make it break.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:05.780]   But I mean, that's awesome.
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:07.860]   And it saves tens of thousands of lives a year
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:11.100]   and is just more convenient than huzzah for the future.
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:13.220]   I'm going to hack my self-driving car
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:16.780]   to make sure that if it's either the pedestrians or me,
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:18.620]   it's going to be the pedestrians that get it.
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:20.900]   Because right now, they--
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:21.900]   All right, I know--
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:22.740]   I think some self-driving--
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:23.620]   This comes up a lot.
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:25.460]   That's a self-ish driving.
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:27.700]   I have a contrarian point of view.
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:29.740]   Maybe it's just because I'm dumb.
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:32.900]   But when I'm listening, I'm going to do this for a lot of time.
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.860]   So everybody's always talking about the ethics.
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.780]   Oh, you know, the bus scenario, the trolley scenario.
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:40.260]   The bridge or whatever it is.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.580]   And how are you going to program that?
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:44.020]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:45.700]   Would anybody buy an autonomous vehicle that
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:47.700]   would sacrifice their life to save a bus
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:50.580]   slow to school children, et cetera, et cetera?
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.820]   And there's a lot of thought about, well,
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:54.660]   they must be working hard on this.
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:55.420]   Here's my thought.
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:56.580]   I bet they're not.
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:57.980]   No, there's--
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:00.340]   There are universities that are working on it.
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.380]   Yeah, let them work on it.
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:02.540]   Mercedes is probably working on it.
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:03.900]   If I am working with you--
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:04.900]   Autonomous vehicle.
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:06.900]   But we're talking-- that's more of a middle ground.
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:08.300]   They're thinking about it because they're at the--
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:08.940]   Because they're at the--
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:09.780]   Everything's autonomous.
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.860]   Then everything's going to know the stop.
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:11.980]   Here's what I would do.
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:13.620]   I'm writing the program for an autonomous vehicle.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:15.740]   I'm just saying, do the best you can not to get a bus.
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:16.820]   Try to save everybody.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:17.780]   Period.
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:18.660]   You don't write in.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.580]   Oh, but if that's a school as full of children--
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:21.580]   Sorry, kids.
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:22.940]   Just go off the cliff.
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:25.620]   You don't write that into the code?
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:27.500]   With those comments, right?
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:31.300]   You write, just do the best you can not to get in an accident.
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:32.020]   Period.
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:34.060]   I want the ethics to do the best you can.
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:34.700]   See that code.
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.660]   Just do the best you can.
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:38.980]   You only have to have one or zero.
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:40.180]   No, just pick a little option.
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:40.940]   No, no, no, no.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:43.060]   The computer has a tree that says,
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:45.460]   if there's something there, they don't do that.
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.340]   You don't write into the tree.
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:49.180]   Oh, there's a bicyclist.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.420]   He's wearing a helmet.
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:52.300]   Hit him instead of the one not wearing it.
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:54.340]   You don't write that into the code.
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:57.420]   You just write code that says, as best you can do the best job
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:57.740]   you can.
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.460]   Extra points for the guy on the recline bike.
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:00.300]   They don't put the--
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:01.740]   No, he gets hit every time.
[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:02.300]   Exactly.
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:03.260]   They were coming by a circle?
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:04.660]   It's a lot of shoot on side of my books.
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:05.180]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:05.900]   Oh.
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:09.140]   Are there any death panels for car AI technology?
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:09.780]   Are you the guy?
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:12.140]   So I'm writing my recumbent bicycle down the street
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:14.660]   the other day, and somebody threw a water bottle at my hand.
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:15.860]   Is that you?
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:17.100]   I've been found out.
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:18.340]   His car did it.
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:19.100]   His car.
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.180]   It has a little eject button.
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:21.820]   It's like, oh, he's like, a trigger.
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:23.860]   I would like to hear from somebody
[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:28.340]   who is actively involved in coding autonomous systems
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:33.780]   for vehicles if they write in any kind of ethical conundrum
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:34.700]   crap or--
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.300]   They're computer programmers.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:37.580]   What are you talking about?
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:39.820]   Do they have a point system for the value of various types
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.540]   of lives?
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:41.660]   Someone else does that.
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:43.180]   Yeah, that's some guy in a university
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:44.700]   who never wrote a line of code in his life.
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:45.700]   He's just thinking about it.
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:46.900]   He's not writing it.
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.060]   If you're writing it, you just say, just do the best you can.
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:50.500]   Just do your best.
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.380]   But the definition of best is so fraught.
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:53.060]   No, it's not.
[01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:53.820]   You know what the best is?
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:54.380]   Don't hit.
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:54.860]   They shit.
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:55.820]   OK, OK, good.
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:56.820]   We're all in the right way.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:58.140]   Point one way out.
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:42:58.820]   Oh, wait.
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:00.580]   I shouldn't hit everyone that's alive.
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:01.500]   Yes, fantastic.
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.780]   But by point 57, which is where it's actually complicated.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:06.540]   Isn't that your rule, though, in life, you don't hit stuff?
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:09.260]   So if there's something coming at you,
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:10.980]   you're not making the calculation
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:12.300]   when if I turn to the left out--
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:13.060]   kill four people.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:14.380]   If I turn to the right, I'll kill one person.
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:16.180]   If I hit that thing, it'll just kill me.
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.460]   You jam the freaking brakes on.
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:19.500]   And then you get hit from--
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.420]   I mean, like, yeah, but you don't think about that.
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:23.260]   You just jam on the brakes and hope that--
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:24.700]   yes, you just jam on the brakes.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:26.180]   And all of a sudden, bam, you have a CS degree.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:28.780]   And Lee was your professor.
[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:30.580]   You just tell it to do the best you can, guys.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:30.980]   Come on.
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:31.620]   You just code it in.
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:32.420]   It's easier.
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:33.420]   So here's the scenario.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:35.260]   There's no ethics in computer programming.
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:36.060]   You're on a cliff.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:36.780]   You're on a cliff.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:39.060]   And there's a bunch of hikers in the road.
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:41.180]   And you can't stop in time.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.700]   And your only choice is either drive off the cliff
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:45.820]   or plow through the hikers.
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:49.540]   That's a scenario where it's like doing the best you can
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:50.700]   means you drive off the cliff.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.300]   No, it means you jam on the brakes
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:54.260]   and you hope for the best.
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:57.460]   You do not actively put a line of code that says,
[01:43:57.460 --> 01:43:59.340]   don't hit those guys drive off the cliff.
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:01.180]   You imagine you need to have a world where there aren't
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:05.420]   blind turns where they write code that handles the best
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:06.300]   they can.
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.140]   But if you're doing 60 around a blind turn
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.220]   and there's something in the way and you don't have a choice,
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:13.340]   which is why people hit tons of deer every year.
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:15.060]   They're doing the best they can.
[01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:15.700]   Right.
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:17.460]   But they still plow into that deer.
[01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:18.860]   They still stomp on that brake.
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:20.620]   That's as good as you can hold our car.
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:22.620]   You should teach a class on the ethics.
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:23.940]   And it would be like a Trump seminar.
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:26.100]   It's like it'd be like two hours.
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:27.900]   This car is really great.
[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:29.580]   You need autonomous deer.
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:30.860]   Autonomous deer would solve the problem.
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:31.340]   See, that's amazing.
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:32.500]   You should never look for the men.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:34.060]   Because they would neck to your heads.
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:36.380]   And why did Google sell Boston Dynamics?
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:38.260]   Here was the opportunity I think we all--
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:38.780]   You don't like it.
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:39.820]   They didn't go all in.
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:41.900]   Going back to the empathy point from before about robots
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:44.940]   and humanizing technology.
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:46.740]   There's been fun you were happening before you interrupted it.
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.900]   I forget what it was now.
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.020]   Dang.
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:49.780]   Oh, Trump, yes.
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:50.380]   That was hilarious.
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:51.220]   Well done.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:52.020]   Thank you.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.540]   Thanks for bringing that back.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.860]   Oh, we had the Trump fans in the chat.
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:57.180]   We have live chat.
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:01.540]   You know when Google sold the Boston Dynamics?
[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.220]   You can see they're already getting tired of it.
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:05.300]   When this video--
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:06.500]   When this video aired--
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.460]   I've watched this one again.
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:10.060]   --is when Google sold Boston Dynamics.
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.500]   You feel bad for the robot, though.
[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:12.340]   Every time you like hell--
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:13.700]   We shouldn't have these guys in the same building as us.
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:17.940]   It's the robot with a 2x4 and knocks it over.
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:18.940]   The guy--
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:19.780]   But watch it.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:20.780]   Watch it.
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:21.780]   It gets up.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:22.780]   It's resilient.
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:23.780]   It takes no, no, no for an answer.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:24.780]   You know what it does?
[01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:25.780]   It remembers.
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:26.780]   It makes--
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:27.780]   I'm-- you're on my list.
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:28.780]   I'm believing.
[01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:30.100]   That's a die cloud, of course.
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.300]   I'm going to another company.
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:32.820]   This is when-- that's when Google--
[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:33.820]   I'm telling you.
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:36.140]   That's when Google sold Boston Dynamics is when that video--
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:38.900]   not because they didn't understand it,
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.180]   but because they went, oh, crap.
[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:42.900]   Perception in the airpiece.
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:44.780]   They should have kept them because they're not going to apologize.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:47.340]   Now I think Toyota owns them or invested in them.
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.660]   So Toyota can be like, you know what?
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:50.220]   Google's been working on these cars.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:51.220]   All these robots--
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.220]   Send some of these guys over there.
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:53.460]   Bust them up a little bit.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:55.540]   All these robots were designed for the military.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.900]   And Google-- and then when Google bought them, they said, OK,
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:59.860]   we're not going to do military applications.
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:02.420]   And then so everybody in the robotics department said, well,
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:03.500]   what are we doing these for?
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.660]   And the Pentagon said, well, we need your robots coming.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:06.660]   Throw billions of dollars.
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:09.860]   By the way, you have a contract that says you're going to continue to do this.
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:12.620]   Also, their first commercial model, the little rabbit-size one,
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:13.500]   was too loud, right?
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.500]   It was a problem that was just too noisy.
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:15.500]   You had a diesel in human.
[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:16.500]   [SCREAMING]
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:17.020]   What?
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.500]   I think the stealth robot that's like, I'm here.
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:20.500]   I've arrived.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.300]   But they got quieter.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:22.300]   They had us too stroking.
[01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:23.780]   And you're just, bop, bop, bop, bop.
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:25.700]   Shoeing oil into the sky.
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.940]   Either there's a robot coming to kill me.
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:30.260]   Or somebody's leaf blowing, right?
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:31.700]   On the battlefield.
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:32.700]   But it's cute.
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:34.780]   Dun, dun, dun.
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:36.260]   There's no leaves.
[01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:36.860]   Where were we?
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:39.180]   Oh, Malick, writing in the New Yorker.
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:40.340]   You come on.
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:42.060]   Admit it, guys. You're pissed.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:42.560]   About the--
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:43.860]   Homalick retreats.
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:46.740]   He sells giga-ohm, becomes a venture capitalist,
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.260]   and he still gets to write for the New York.
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:48.260]   I know.
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:49.260]   I am pissed, for sure.
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:49.260]   I know.
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:50.260]   He's too nice.
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:50.760]   Yes.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.420]   I love ome, but come on.
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:52.940]   Yeah.
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:54.460]   He shouldn't get to write for the New Yorker.
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:55.700]   Leave some for the rest of us.
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.340]   Leave some for the rest of us.
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:46:57.860]   Thank you.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:58.860]   Chill.
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:46:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:46:59.980]   Ome.
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:00.340]   Come on.
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:02.700]   Stop owning the world, ome.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:05.140]   So this is an article that came out yesterday.
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:07.220]   Facebook's news feed often changed.
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:07.980]   Never great.
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:08.700]   Yes.
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:09.300]   Nice.
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:09.980]   Nice.
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:10.820]   That's well done.
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:11.740]   That's some journalism right there.
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:14.500]   And I don't think when you write for the New Yorker that some other person writes your
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:14.860]   headline.
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:17.540]   I think you get to write your headline, don't you?
[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:18.900]   Probably not.
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:21.860]   It's the most heavily fact-checked publication in history of mankind.
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:24.220]   But most newspapers, you don't write your headline.
[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:27.100]   That's a good three days of talking about your headline.
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:27.620]   Your headline.
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:28.820]   Oh, I can't find more.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:29.340]   It's a good story.
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:31.300]   People with actual pencils.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:31.740]   What?
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:35.460]   Facebook's announced with this week that it would tweak its news feed.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.460]   Does it have a nude feed?
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:37.420]   Because that's the--
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:37.900]   It does.
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:39.340]   If you're following the right people--
[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:40.340]   Not on Facebook.
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:41.340]   It felt all too familiar.
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:42.340]   Facebook makes changes.
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:43.340]   People howl.
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:44.660]   Fortunes are lost.
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:46.020]   Facebook gets stronger.
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:50.140]   But then Facebook reconsider and starts tweaking its feed again.
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:51.140]   Repeat.
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:51.660]   Repeat.
[01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:52.180]   Repeat.
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:53.500]   And that's exactly what's happening.
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.780]   This time, Facebook announced this week.
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:58.180]   Oh, guess what?
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:02.140]   You know we were saying to the Washington Post and the New York Times and BuzzFeed and
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:04.220]   Vice, you should publish all your content on Facebook.
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:06.540]   It'd be a really great place for you to reach viewers.
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:07.540]   Guess what?
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:12.420]   We're going to prioritize our feeds for posts from your friends and family.
[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:14.820]   Forget it, you guys.
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:18.140]   Now first of all, this must have come as a surprise to people who joined Facebook and
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:21.900]   thought that's why they joined Facebook and see posts from their friends and family.
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:22.900]   Those people.
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.980]   And something that up rocks upwardly and the bad side of BuzzFeed.
[01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.940]   And by the way, I think they really did do it because I noticed in my Facebook feed,
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:31.140]   I'm seeing people like friend, mostly.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:33.780]   That's why feed is a garbage fire right now.
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:34.780]   Is it?
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:37.500]   It's the same four posts just at the top of the feed.
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:38.500]   Right.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:39.500]   Every day.
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.500]   Facebook.com.
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.420]   Do you have a browser on there?
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:43.420]   It's on your internet.
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:44.420]   Mine's turned off.
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:45.420]   Turn on the internet.
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:46.900]   No, my feeds turned off.
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:47.900]   All right.
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:49.220]   So there's my sister-in-law and brother-in-law.
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:50.980]   They're at a ballgame.
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:53.620]   There I am with Michael O'Donnell and Brownie Rainbows.
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:54.620]   Somebody tag you.
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:55.620]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:56.620]   Yeah.
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:57.620]   Don't say you're doing it.
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:01.340]   Here's my wife posting pictures of berries that she's going to apparently graze for a
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:02.420]   while at.
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:03.420]   That's on the way to work.
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.420]   She must have walked away.
[01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:05.420]   Who says the blackberries did?
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:06.420]   Yeah.
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:07.420]   She's got one of our employees.
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:09.500]   The momentum of the show is to climb a little bit.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:10.500]   I feel.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:11.900]   So I haven't seen any news.
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.860]   Here's my first high school girlfriend.
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:14.860]   Aw.
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:15.860]   Aw.
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:17.100]   Ever wonder what she's been up to?
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:18.100]   That's creepy.
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:19.420]   I've never actually thought I'd let your former girlfriend's my life.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:22.700]   There's a guy I used to know, Mike Elgin and his serial number.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.700]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:24.700]   Yeah.
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:25.700]   Oh.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:27.260]   I glimpsed the trip all the way from Santa Barbara.
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:28.700]   You drove here from Santa Barbara?
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:29.700]   Yes.
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:30.700]   Yes.
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.940]   Oh, well, I'm flying out here tomorrow.
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:32.940]   Wasn't just for you.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:33.940]   Oh, you had to come up here anyway.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:34.940]   I would have done it just for you, Leo.
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:35.940]   But I did.
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.740]   That's a long trip.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:38.740]   It was great.
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:40.740]   Here's the guy who used to do ICANN has cheeseburger.
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:43.140]   Now just does boring post about the muscle.
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:44.140]   Oh, Ben, huh?
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:45.140]   Huh?
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:46.140]   Careful.
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:47.140]   No, I love Ben.
[01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:48.140]   I love Ben.
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:51.920]   Don't you think, though, a lot of times people who are really boring wear white glasses
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:54.260]   frames to look like their hip?
[01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:57.540]   Why are mauler wears clear, friends?
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:49:59.620]   I just feel like that's a really boring thing to do.
[01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:00.620]   We're a scarf.
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:01.620]   No.
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:03.420]   Now I'm going to get in trouble.
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.420]   Infinity scarf.
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:05.420]   That's a good thing.
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.420]   Anyway.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:09.940]   So what happened if you're a news organization?
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:12.260]   Are you now going, "What the what?
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:13.260]   We're all in on Facebook."
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.940]   Well, everyone's been sort of scammed by Facebook.
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:19.020]   Businesses were scammed because they were told to make pages and then your pages, you
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:20.020]   know, when you post something.
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:21.020]   And they stopped showing them.
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:22.820]   And then suddenly those stopped.
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:23.820]   Yeah.
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:24.820]   Musicians, the same thing.
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:25.820]   They've had the same problem.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:26.820]   Yeah.
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:29.060]   Imagine you're a company, a little company called Zinga.
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:30.060]   Mm.
[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:32.220]   And you've built a billion dollar business on Farmville.
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:33.220]   Yep.
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:35.460]   And then all of a sudden Facebook doesn't do that.
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.460]   No more.
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:37.460]   So I get everyone in.
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:38.460]   They're like, "Come and do this thing.
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:39.460]   Do this thing."
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:40.460]   Right.
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:41.460]   Awesome.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.460]   Well, you want to grow your audience?
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:43.460]   You want to grow your audience?
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:44.460]   Who wrote Superpoke.
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:45.460]   There'll be awesome.
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:46.460]   Where is he now?
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:47.460]   Oh, poor Superpoke.
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:48.460]   And then they're like, "Hey, we're not going to do that."
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:50.900]   And then those people are just like, "Well, now we're there and we kind of have to stay
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:52.460]   here because it is Facebook."
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:53.460]   Everybody's here.
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:54.660]   And everyone's here.
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.900]   And every once in a while Facebook will appease their read.
[01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:57.900]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:59.460]   You just say, "Oh, you know what?
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.660]   We're going to make it so it's just you and your friends."
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:04.020]   It's just your friends and family, all that other stuff.
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:05.020]   You're not going to see.
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:07.020]   Well, I mean, you are going to see the ads that we're using.
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:09.020]   You always see those ads.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:10.020]   You're going to see all those ads.
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:14.300]   And of course, if those pages are, you know, if they want to give us money to boost their
[01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.700]   post, you'll see those.
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:19.020]   But really, it's just about, you know, owning your own platform.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:20.020]   It's about owning your own.
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.500]   It's the Apple Music Spotify thing.
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:22.500]   Again, bait and switch.
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:25.500]   When you depend on someone else's platform, they can change the rules and you can be materially
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:26.500]   impacting.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.740]   And yet it's so attractive.
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:31.140]   And so desirable, you keep...
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:35.100]   It's like Charlie Brown in the football.
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:40.100]   Lucy, as many times as Lucy yanks that football away, you're going to go back and try to kick
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:41.340]   it because it's so...
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:44.500]   It will feel so good when you hit it, when you finally hit it.
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:49.420]   And the general public doesn't see social networking and social media as a platform that
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:52.460]   they don't see themselves as content creators or any of that stuff.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:55.780]   They just say, "Oh, well, that's where I find out about people."
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:56.780]   And so...
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:57.780]   That's what everybody thinks Facebook is.
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:59.540]   Here's the thing that bugs me about all this.
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:02.180]   So essentially what happened was they made this big...
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:03.780]   So I wrote a comment about this.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:06.020]   It's like social media and social networking.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:07.660]   Social networking is kind of on the decline.
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:12.740]   And social media is on the rise because it's easier to get more money out of social media.
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:18.020]   It's easier to get more money when the New York Times has, you know, fast mobile pages
[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:19.340]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:20.340]   And so they...
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:23.220]   So Facebook, which was created as a social network...
[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:24.220]   Right.
[01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:25.220]   It's now...
[01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:26.220]   Wait a minute.
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.220]   It was...
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:30.260]   So what happened was it became...
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:33.460]   Everybody started talking about Facebook as a social media platform that they were paying
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:37.860]   publishers to do this, paying publishers to do that, favoring publishing, publishing,
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:38.860]   publishing.
[01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:41.700]   And people were like, "Wait, you know, it was bad press, essentially."
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:45.620]   Well, and also a bit of them in the butt because then, conservatives said, "Oh, no, no."
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.620]   That's right.
[01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:47.620]   You're pulling down...
[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:48.620]   Exactly.
[01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:53.060]   You're espousing your political beliefs through manipulation of the news.
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.060]   Exactly.
[01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:55.060]   But the real criticism...
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:56.060]   I don't think they were doing it.
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:57.060]   They were doing it.
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:52:58.060]   They were doing it.
[01:52:58.060 --> 01:52:59.060]   They were doing it.
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:00.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:00.060 --> 01:53:01.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:02.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:03.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:04.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:05.060]   They were doing it.

[01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:07.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:08.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:09.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:10.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:11.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:12.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:13.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:14.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.060]   They were doing it.

[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:21.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:23.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:24.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:26.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:27.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:28.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:29.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:30.060]   They were doing it.
[01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:31.060]   They were doing it.
