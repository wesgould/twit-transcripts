[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.000]   The news roundtable where we discuss the week's tech news with some of the best minds in the
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.400]   business and we have a perfect panel for this week's tech news.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.640]   We're going to start with Brianna Wu.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.560]   She is running for Congress in the Massachusetts 8th, a game developer.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.120]   She used to be Space Cat gal.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.960]   But now she's just Brianna Wu on the Twitter.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.960]   Hi Brianna!
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.160]   It's so good to be here.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.640]   I'm not Paris Martinou but I am Brianna Wu.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.800]   So Paris was scheduled.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   She got sick.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   We sorry we'll get her back.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.680]   But Brianna very kindly said I'll step in probably because this is normally the period
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.600]   of time where you're calling donors.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   That's correct.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   To raise money and anything is better.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.400]   We're rather talk tech or asterangers for money.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.320]   Anything is better than doing that.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.000]   But you've talked about call time before.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.920]   I mean it's a necessity.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.760]   Although when you get elected and there's a whole new batch of freshmen members of Congress
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.520]   in January 2020, or I guess January 2021, I hope one of the first orders of businesses
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.400]   fixing the amount of money that's in politics so that you don't have to do call time anymore.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.720]   It's a terrible idea.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.800]   Every second I'm in the office calling strangers.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.080]   I could be going to schools or finding out about more issues in the district.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.360]   I'm mystified by Congress is not voted to make it a whole way.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.760]   You're not really mystified.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   Okay, I'm not.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   Come on.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.600]   It's bad for our democracy.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   But it's bad.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.120]   The influence of money in politics is clearly bad.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.960]   We've got to fix that.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.120]   We also have two people not in the US, which I think is fantastic.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.480]   Patrick Bezia is here.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.760]   He is from frenchspin.com, our favorite Franco phone.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760]   Hello, Patrick.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.080]   Oh, hey, thanks for having me.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.600]   We don't have Paris, but I am in Paris.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.920]   So in some way it's all good.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   That's right.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.960]   Instead of Paris Mart, no, we've got Paris, France.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.960]   Ten times better.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   It's not so bad.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.200]   And not confusingly, and the least he is not Patrick on Twitter.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.360]   Listen, it's all about branding.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.680]   Everyone who's heard that Twitter handle already remembers it.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.760]   Yeah, everybody else is doing the real John C. de Vorac.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.000]   No, no, the real Leel report.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.640]   He's not Patrick and I like it that way.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:35.840]   And joining us another European, at least for another few days, Bloomberg's Europe Tech
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.040]   Editor Nate Langston.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.880]   If Brexit happens, do you have to change your title to British Tech Editor?
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.720]   No.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.080]   Let's cross that bridge after Halloween.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   Or not.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.520]   Thanks for bringing up the B word within two seconds.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   But yeah.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.440]   Well, it just reassures us Americans that we're not the only people screwed.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.240]   No, we're all in this together.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.960]   We're all in it together, kids.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   What does your t-shirts say?
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   I like it.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.400]   Cruel Summer, lover.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.240]   It's a Taylor Swift special.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.240]   Oh Lord.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   It just arrived.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.280]   I liked it because it looks like the heavy metal set lists that I actually go to all
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   the time.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.800]   But it's a Taylor Swift.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.200]   It's ironic Taylor Swift.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.520]   Oh, I love Taylor Swift, but it is also kind of an ironic t-shirt to wear it on a text show.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.240]   So now we really don't know what we think of Nate Langston.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   Does he love Taité?
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.240]   Does he not love Taité?
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   Is he ironically Taité?
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.080]   Who doesn't love Taité?
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.040]   She's a wonderful human, but my heavy metal drum kit behind me probably speaks for the
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   whole world.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.280]   Yeah, you've got street credit.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.920]   This might be blasphemy.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.120]   I don't have strong feelings anyway towards Taité.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.680]   And Christina loves her.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.680]   Oh my God.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.680]   Yes.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.760]   Your co-hosts on Rocket are like, that's probably half of the show you're talking about Taylor
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.160]   Swift.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.720]   So that must be interesting for you.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.840]   You're running for office.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.360]   You probably have to talk about this right.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.360]   It's right.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.080]   It's the device of issues without having to take a stance on Taité, right?
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   Exactly.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.320]   This is my theory, by the way, that the biggest battles are over the most inconsequential matters,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   right?
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   Because everybody can have opinion on Taité.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.360]   You don't have to know anything.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.440]   So that becomes a vicious battle to the death, you know?
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.480]   Economics, well, it's more complicated, but everybody's got opinion on Jiff versus Giff.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   You know?
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   Very much so.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.480]   I'm not going to bring that up.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.400]   That's really too divisive.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.040]   This country cannot stand another Giff, Giff rift.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.320]   Let's talk about China, something pleasant, something.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.760]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   Oh my God.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:01.040]   So China's been on our minds all week because of various contour tone with China and American
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.040]   companies.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.920]   But let's set the stage with this story from the Washington Post.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.040]   This is a Chinese app that is basically, it's not required, but if you're in the Chinese
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.120]   Communist Party, you must have it.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.280]   It's on 100 million Android cell phones in China.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.720]   It is also on iOS phones.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.560]   It is many workplaces in China require you have it.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.080]   The app is, well, on the face of it, not a bad thing.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.320]   It's an educational app that teaches Chinese people about their country.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.920]   It's name translated in English is study the great nation.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.120]   And it contains news articles and videos, many of them about President Xi, the president
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.720]   for life at China.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.520]   There's also a sense of competition.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.840]   Users are in points for reading articles and commenting on them.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.120]   There's a leader board.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.520]   The post reports at least one worker in China who has to read the articles and take the
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.880]   quizzes and get 2,000 points or she'll be fired.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.280]   So it's kind of semi-required in China.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.960]   Interestingly, though, the Open Technology Fund, which is initiative funded by our government
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.160]   under Radio Free Asia, took the Android version of the app and submitted it to a security
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:34.480]   analyst, Cure 53, a German cybersecurity firm, to determine what the app can do.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.000]   Now this is the Android version.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.160]   It's not clear what the iPhone version would be capable of, but in the case of the Android
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.140]   version, once the app is installed, it basically
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:50.440]   gives the Chinese government super user surveillance on the app.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:58.040]   The ability to turn on the camera or microphone, to record, to see every message, to have access
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:04.840]   to more than a hundred apps, I'm sorry, 960 apps, including shopping, travel, messaging
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.540]   platforms.
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.880]   It can access photos and videos, transmit the user's location.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.420]   Dial phone numbers go through contacts and internet activity.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.500]   It even can turn on the Wi-Fi and the flashlight.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:27.180]   It is basically an all-powerful app, basically required by the Chinese government, installed
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.580]   on a hundred million phones.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.240]   That's the Android version.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.920]   They did not analyze the Apple version and it's possible that Apple has more restrictions
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.660]   on what apps can do.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:43.160]   But it's possible not, as we know, from the zero day that was being used by the Chinese
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.720]   government to monitor Uighurs.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.480]   So here's a really good example of what we don't thank God have yet in this country,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.600]   but a government app that surveils its citizenry 100%.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:05.240]   I've been thinking a little bit about this because what has happened more and more in
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:12.020]   the last few years, maybe months, is this little pocket pal of ours that is so incredibly
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.820]   useful and it does so many things for us.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.820]   Has somewhat become the enemy in our pocket?
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.300]   Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, use it to surveil us.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.700]   Apps, Vi'd put more notifications on our screen because they're essentially advertisements
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.420]   for the app.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.900]   The phone seems to have a life of its own and more and more I hear from users.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:39.520]   I heard from an 86-year-old woman today on the radio show said, "Apple hasn't been able
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.120]   to help me turn off all the pop-ups on my iPhone."
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.120]   And I think she was talking about notifications.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.680]   I helped her a little bit to turn those off, but she was incredibly irritated about this.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.160]   It is the ultimate surveillance device.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.640]   And one of the reasons law enforcement has these tools from Celebright, and we know the
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.640]   New York Police Department has it that can unlock all the data on this phone, is because
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.380]   it is incredibly valuable.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.900]   Is this smartphone our enemy or our friend?
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.300]   And should we be more concerned about it?
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.100]   I hear you, Brianna nodding.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.300]   I couldn't agree more.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.300]   This is terrifying.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.380]   Orwellian is not a strong enough statement for this.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.980]   This is straight out of 1984 where the Winston Smith's Visis screen was looking at him as
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.900]   much as he was looking at it, right?
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.900]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.260]   This is infinitely more powerful than smartphone.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.020]   And I do think it's worth noting, I don't think this would fly in America.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.800]   I think if our government tried to do this, we would definitely push back.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.760]   There will be lawsuits about it.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:50.100]   Although, in a way, if the New York City Police Department has Celebright in the station and
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.040]   you get arrested, not convicted, but arrested, they take your phone.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.360]   If you try to get into the country, they can take your phone and suck everything out of
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   it.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   How different is that?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.360]   I'm not sure it is.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   It's not.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.660]   And this is why we need very strong privacy protections.
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.660]   We need a privacy bill of rights.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.700]   It's written with 2019 standards to look at the issues we weren't facing in 1990, but
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.940]   we're facing today.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.100]   That is incredibly important.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.900]   And it's very clear, you know, these status quo politicians, they don't understand this
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.900]   stuff.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.900]   They don't care about it.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.500]   So I think it's really imperative that you vote for candidates that will, you know, actively
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.540]   voice their support for privacy.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:34.040]   I completely agree with all of this.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:40.640]   And that is essential that we get people in office in, you know, the US and the UN everywhere
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.640]   who understand the importance of all of these things.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.900]   That being said, comparing what's happening in China with, you know, what could happen
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:54.280]   somewhere else, which everything could happen everywhere, is a little bit alarmist because
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:01.000]   China has, I feel like this week or these past few weeks for a number of reasons, a few
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:11.880]   things happened, have kind of made us realize, first of all, how totalitarian China has become?
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.600]   I don't know if that's a fair way of saying it, but for a couple of decades or a few more,
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.880]   we were thinking, well, economic growth will make things better.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:27.160]   And since Xi Jinping has come into power, I feel like maybe it's just that we see it
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.280]   because tech has been involved more, but the state has become more and more restrictive
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.000]   and like full on totalitarian.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.040]   So I don't know, it's the core issue when the tech is being used for this, but the core
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.800]   issue is the nature of that state.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.720]   And what's new now, and I don't know if you want to talk about this now, but it's
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.720]   bleeped.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:59.840]   It's so important and we are so embedded economically and technologically with China that it's values
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.880]   and its demands are bleeding into our realm.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.560]   It's not so separated anymore.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.080]   But if you're talking about tech only and the way they're using it, you know, the Stasi
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.960]   was spying on everyone in East Germany already.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.560]   Just imagine what the Stasi could have done with the smartphone.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.880]   Well, what China is doing now, that's what they would have done.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.360]   So in a way, it's the nexus of, you know, China was going through a liberalism in the
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.920]   80s that led to Tiananmen Square protests and a crackdown in the 90s.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.360]   And that's why there was some hope that China might be.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.480]   The whole idea, I think, was, well, China as, you know, they're digging their way out of
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.200]   basically out of feudalism.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.000]   But as they do so and become more prosperous, there will be increased liberalism.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.120]   I'd say that with the, you know, it's not liberals, it's liberalism, it's Western liberalism
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.080]   in China, the idea of freedom and so forth.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.920]   That seems to not be the case any longer.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.680]   It also seems to be changing in Russia.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:05.880]   And then that is the big issue because this was the week the NBA, cow-towed to China.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:13.080]   This was the week that Blizzard, your former employer, Patrick, cow-towed to China.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:19.160]   This was the week that Google, cow-towed to China pulling an app that was a game around
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.080]   the Hong Kong protests.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:28.480]   And the one that seems to me most concerning is Apple, which has first removed and put
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:35.640]   back under after a lot of protests and then removed the app that helps Hong Kong protesters
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.440]   track the police.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:45.960]   And then Tim Cook, who is, you know, a champion of freedom, at least in his rhetoric, writes
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.920]   a memo to Apple employees saying we had to pull it because it was being used to target
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:58.560]   police parroting the, I believe, incorrect assertions of the Chinese government.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.640]   And so my concern, we had a big debate over this on Friday on this week in Google.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:10.400]   My concern is that American companies, instead of championing the freedoms that let them
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.640]   succeed economically, are giving an undue influence to the Chinese government because
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.240]   of its great economic value to them.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.080]   Leo, I mean, it's worth saying this is the exact, these are the exact same tech companies
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.840]   that tell us we have to accelerate, accept hate speech.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.200]   We have to accept, you know, extreme harassment, the kind of which I've received.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.640]   And then they turn around and say, Oh, unless it's a very powerful government asking for
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.640]   this thing.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   And then it's fine.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.360]   It seems very hypocritical to me.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.360]   I've been very curious.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.320]   Is it because it's a powerful government or is it because there's one, it's a market of
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.480]   one and a half billion people?
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.360]   I think it's a both of those things.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:57.880]   That's more reprehensible to me because it's, it's bowing to the dollar, not to, you know,
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:03.320]   politics or ideology or fear, it's bowing to greed.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:08.240]   Well, I think, you know, there are others that can speak to this, but I think it's worth
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.680]   noting that Tencent has taken huge equity stakes in many American game companies.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.240]   I've spent a career specializing in Unreal Engine.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.040]   Tencent owns a huge venture capital stake in that.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.080]   They own a huge stake in Blizzard.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.200]   They own a huge stake in a lot of American game companies.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.720]   And you know, this is a price that we are paying when we are allowing this foreign investment
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.080]   into American tech companies.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.360]   So I do think that's something we should have a much more honest conversation about.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.160]   Nate, and it's interesting.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   Okay, go ahead, Patrick.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.360]   I just want to get Nate in the conversation.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.000]   He's wisely staying out of it.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.840]   And I'm not going to let you, I'm not going to let you recruit your crews yourself here.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:56.480]   When people are saying smart things that I agree with, I tend to stay quiet because
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.600]   it's easier to not put your foot in your mouth when other people are doing the smart
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.360]   talking for you.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.640]   But I do have a couple of thoughts that sprung to mind.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:12.240]   The first is that this is always an opportunity to vote with our wallets.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.840]   We have a choice whether we buy a certain company's product or not.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.200]   Most of us do anyway, and that is something that we can consciously choose to change if
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.600]   we want in the future based on what a company does.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:31.280]   The other thing that I thought is worth mentioning kind of goes back to the surveillance app
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.600]   that we talked about a few minutes ago.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:41.040]   Because we have this issue in the UK at the moment where our government wants backdoors
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.120]   being added into end-to-end encrypted messaging, which on a technical level raises a whole
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.600]   load of questions as to how exactly do you put a backdoor in something that's encrypted
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   end-to-end.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:58.960]   But the whole reason is to try and target terrorism and very serious crime.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.880]   And what always happens is we just see the people who are actually doing that just use
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.960]   a different product or a different piece of software.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:13.160]   And so my question would be with the Chinese app that we were talking about, whether the
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.440]   people that the government most wants to track are actually the ones who are not going to
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.360]   be using Android or they're going to use a heavily, they've got a different ROM, they
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.000]   flash the whole thing, they're not using that app.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.140]   And actually it is the average person in the street who once again tends to bear the
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.920]   brunt of the surveillance when the people who are most the biggest threat to whatever
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.680]   institution are, they're off using a different product.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.560]   It's an interesting point, isn't it?
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.800]   This is the case with a lot of these kinds of, I think about copy protection, which never
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   stopped pirates.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:57.760]   Yeah, but I think in the case of China in that app, it's not targeting specific people.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:04.040]   I don't think it's just blanketing as much of it as possible, which is just an illustration
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.160]   of how totalitarian China, I don't...
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.080]   The difference is turning, but...
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.640]   The difference is, Patrick, China doesn't have to justify it by saying, well, we're going
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.040]   to find child pornography guys or terrorists.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.800]   We have to do that in the United States when we want to do mass surveillance.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.040]   We have to make up a pretext and say, well, think of the children, but in China, they
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.680]   just say, everybody has to have this app.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.840]   It's a very different culture.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.840]   No, it's even worse.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.840]   You know, it's...
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.840]   Go ahead.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.840]   First, I want to hear what...
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.840]   What is your thought, Patrick, and I want to talk to Nate, because I think this is an interesting
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.840]   point.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.720]   I was going to take it into a slightly different direction.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   So Nate...
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   Yeah, so Nate, because I think he's going to be on the...
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.160]   He raises the cultural argument.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.760]   And this is an interesting argument that's often made by people who say, but you have
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:57.640]   to understand China and the Chinese people, they want this kind of security and safety.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.700]   Yeah, I mean, it's just a bottom line that culturally, we in...
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.860]   Certainly in Western Europe, certainly you guys in the US, we grow up with a very different
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:13.700]   view on privacy and personal freedoms, freedoms of speech and what have you.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.940]   In China, my understanding, and I don't want to step out of line by pretending I know more
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:25.640]   about this than I actually do, but I do understand that the inherent feeling of privacy is just
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.060]   very, very different.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.660]   And what we as onlookers from outside looking in, we think...
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.540]   This is terrible, this would never fly here.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.940]   I think those comments are absolutely correct.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.800]   It wouldn't, but they're not flying here.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.860]   They're flying in China, where people just have a different expectation and we can decide
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.180]   between ourselves whether we think it's right or wrong, but fundamentally that's probably
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.220]   not going to change in even the near or medium term future.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:58.980]   I also want to, in that regard, point to Machia Chaglaski, who is the creator of Pinboard
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:08.020]   and has been in Hong Kong for some time, kind of as an observer, almost an embedded journalist
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.780]   in Hong Kong.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:16.340]   And on his Pinboard Twitter account, he kind of addresses this notion that, "Oh, the Chinese
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:24.020]   people don't mind this surveillance whose video of police chasing and beating a young
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.260]   woman in China."
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.260]   He says, "No, there are people in China.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.460]   The fact that these protests are occurring in Hong Kong show you that Chinese people
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:41.980]   want freedom, want liberty just as much as people in the West, that it's kind of a disservice
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.060]   to say to the Chinese people, "Oh, yeah, you guys like this.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:51.820]   Since Confucianism, you've embraced this, it's okay for the Chinese government to do
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.940]   this because that's what the Chinese people want."
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.660]   Now, and I agree with you, Nate, we, I know we're kind of culturally tone deaf.
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.300]   We're speaking as Americans, not as Chinese citizens.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.020]   And I get a lot of email from people who live in China saying, "Oh, you just don't understand
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.060]   it."
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:12.460]   And so I know that there's controversy over this, but I have to say, Machia, who is there
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:17.100]   on, and by the way, doing an amazing job reporting.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.380]   Here's, here's, he says, an example of why this app that's been banned by Apple, HK Map
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.020]   Live is so vital.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.820]   Can you tell me what color this police flag is?
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.580]   If it's black, people need to put on a tear gas mask.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:36.660]   If it's blue and you're wearing the mask, you go to jail for a year.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:43.340]   You need to know what color the flag is, that flag right here, because that tells you
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.100]   what's going on and HK Map would tell you that.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.700]   And that's why it's vital that HK Map exists.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.900]   It is not being used, as Tim Cook said, to target police or to go to areas where there
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.420]   are no police to steal.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.420]   It's not that at all.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:04.920]   And Tim Cook misstated how, according to Machia, how important HK Map is to the citizens of
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.980]   Hong Kong who are using it to stay safe.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.980]   I think that's why Tim Cook's statement on this, it really rang as hollow and hypocritical
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.100]   and really not standing up to the Chinese government.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.580]   It seems like a very valid use case, as you've said.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.260]   And Leah, I've said this on my show to you before, but I'm married into a Chinese family
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.740]   that immigrated here from China.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.540]   And it definitely has changed my perspective on a lot of things.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:39.540]   For instance, if you were to say this, my father-in-law, I know the first thing he would say is,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.300]   well, look at how many more people the United States has in prison compared to China.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.300]   That's your point.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.300]   Privacy.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   And most of the people of color.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.300]   Good point.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.540]   That would be the first thing he would say to you.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.340]   I do think at the same time, this is a gut check time.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.380]   This is where you show your morals.
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.340]   This is where you show what you're made of.
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:07.740]   I think what was so distressing about Apple, a company that I use and other people use
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.660]   because of their strong stance on privacy and encryption.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.780]   You'll be expecting more of Apple, I guess.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.700]   They've spent billions building up this brand around that Leo.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:22.980]   And for them to just turn around and, you know, side with the Chinese government for
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:32.060]   what really feels like false pretext, it just makes me feel gross about using their stuff.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:38.260]   There is a wider conversation we need to have here in America about our surveillance
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.260]   state.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.820]   It's true the government is not involved in this.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:48.620]   But I think if I sat down with a lot of people that watched Twitter and I showed them, "Okay,
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:54.020]   this is the information I have as a political candidate that I can use to micro target viewers."
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:58.140]   And when you start thinking about the amount of commercial corporate information out there
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.460]   that you can use, it's virtually unlimited.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.340]   It's virtually unregulated.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.340]   There's no rules about what you can say or fact checking as we saw this week.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.180]   Yes, we can talk about that too.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:17.140]   So there's a, I would argue in my opinion that the surveillance state exists in both societies.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.180]   It's just more corporately focused in hours.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.180]   It's really interesting.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.180]   Wow.
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:27.900]   Not just a little sidebar, but according to ABC, the Trump campaign is spending a million
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:33.500]   dollars a week on anti impeachment ads that Facebook is running.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.380]   Many networks are running, but just a million on Facebook last week alone.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:44.140]   And that's what's happened is that the national conversation is now living in this kind of
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.220]   weird, gray state.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.820]   And I think it makes it very hard for citizens to know what's going on.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.820]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.860]   That's kind of a digression.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:55.860]   So let's continue on.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.860]   Okay.
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.300]   I'll give you one more data point.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.300]   You mentioned Tencent.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:06.180]   They're a big shareholder in a couple of game companies you mentioned.
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.180]   That's really interesting.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.180]   There's too many of them.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.180]   Active-
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.180]   Of their peers.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.460]   It's quote unquote only 5%.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.580]   But Epic, which is privately held.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:24.100]   So it's interesting that Tim Sweeney said, I would never allow this at Epic, which I think
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:28.660]   was a message was a preemptive strike towards maybe Tencent picking up the phone at some
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.660]   point.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.060]   How big a state does Tencent have an Epic?
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.060]   Huge.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.060]   40%.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.060]   40%.
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:40.460]   Interestingly, Blizzard with only 5% has said, oh, no, no, no, no, but no, they actually
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:48.100]   banned a Blizzard player because of his pro Hong Kong messages.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.460]   But Epic is saying, no, no, no, anything goes.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.060]   We're never going to do that.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.060]   Wow.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:28:00.900]   And Riot, League of Legends, who is wholly owned by Tencent, has said, we don't want any political
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.340]   speech in our games.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.340]   You could say, well, that's OK.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.780]   That's kind of a following this.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:12.860]   Although the thing is, it's targeted at a, like the way Blizzard reacted to that specific
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.900]   piece of political speech was so expedient and so excessive that it couldn't be interpreted
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.700]   back down other than trying to appease the Chinese.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.700]   They backed down a little bit, right?
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.540]   I think they gave the guy his prize money back.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.540]   They did.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:31.180]   And I think if they had done that to begin with, it wouldn't have been as big a story,
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.180]   but they didn't.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.700]   So it's kind of difficult to forget that what happened happened.
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:44.620]   But that being said, I would like to talk about for just a second the fact that beyond
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:52.220]   the fact that it's happening in China for Chinese citizens or around them, we're realizing
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:58.580]   now how much this influences our end of the planet as well.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:05.420]   I have articles written about TikTok, for example, which enforces a very strong, no political
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.420]   discussion.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:13.300]   Go, go, go look for any Hong Kong postings on TikTok.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.540]   Exactly.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.860]   But it applies to everything.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.700]   And TikTok is big in the West.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:22.660]   Of course, Apple, I mean, a company in the West, it's number one among young people in
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.500]   the West.
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:31.100]   And China dictates a lot of the things that are happening in movies or other cultural
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.100]   elements.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.220]   It's so funny because America used to get all sorts of criticism for cultural hegemony,
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.620]   for enforcing American morals and values in the world through Hollywood.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.020]   Yeah, but I think it wasn't.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:53.100]   It's not even the same because it was American produced culture that would be successful
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.940]   in other territories.
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:59.740]   Here it's American produced movies and any movie that wants to make a lot of money has
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.860]   to adhere by Chinese standards because they have to be successful in China as well, which
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:12.260]   wouldn't be a problem if those standards weren't established by a totalitarian regime.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:18.620]   And the thing is, a company like Blizzard or any gaming company could in theory, if they
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:26.580]   developed an incredible will say, "Okay, we don't care about the money, and so we're
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.780]   going to say no, and we're going to pull out of China."
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:36.980]   And that would be achievable for a company like Apple.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.940]   That might be a fiduciary failure.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.940]   They might be.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.380]   There's shareholders could maybe legitimately say, "Oh, no, no.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.860]   You can't pull out of a billion person market."
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.860]   For all of them, they could say that.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.940]   But Apple can't physically pull out of China.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.260]   All of their production is there.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.380]   If tomorrow they say, "Oh, we don't like Xi Jinping, we think he looks like Winnie the
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.300]   Pooh," all of the factories shut down.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.460]   The next day, and Apple literally goes under.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.860]   I would argue, so look at Tim Sweeney and Epic.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.420]   This is a fantastic example.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:17.020]   This is why I've spent my career working in Unreal Engine 4 is much better than Unreal
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:22.220]   Engine 3, in part thanks to the massive investment that Tencent made.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.020]   They redid Blueprint.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.620]   It's just a far better engine overall.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:32.380]   If you look at Epic's track record in the kind of games that they allowed to be constructed
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:38.580]   with Unreal Engine, do you realize that hatred, the mass shooter game made by a white supremacist
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.820]   a few years ago, that was made with Unreal Engine.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.980]   They said, "We're going to allow this."
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.940]   Epic didn't pull a license with that.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.140]   I would argue that's a fine thing, even though there are people actually asking for DLC of
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   murdering me and other women in that game.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:01.460]   My point here is Tim Sweeney, 40% stake by Tencent.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:07.180]   He preemptively went forward and said, "We're not going to be working with you here.
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.500]   We can't censor this."
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.300]   That was real leadership.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:19.420]   I think he deserves credit for taking a hard line with Fortnite being as big a hit as it
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.820]   is, not just in this country, but all around the world in saying, "We're not going to
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.020]   back down on this."
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.300]   That's a stand that Blizzard wouldn't take and Apple and Google.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   A lot of people will say, and this is part of the conversation we had on Friday, these
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.500]   are not corporations.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.540]   They are formed with one intent to make money.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.900]   We're a capitalist nation.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:55.900]   Tim Cook doesn't have to apologize for following the laws of China because he's in China.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.460]   This is what Apple's job is.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:03.100]   Of course, they're going to follow the laws of whatever country they're in.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.820]   Doesn't that let them off the hook?
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:11.740]   There's one big difference between some of the companies that we just mentioned and Apple.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.980]   Right now doesn't need to back down.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:22.940]   Apple, it has concerned investors who are worried about growth, shrinking iPhone sales,
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.860]   of where is the next revolutionary product going to come from.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:31.700]   I don't think Apple is able to stand and say, "Okay, well, we'll just pull out a China,
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.700]   then that's fine."
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.580]   Epic is in a position where it could do if it wanted to.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.860]   No, it's software is in services.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:47.740]   If Apple, any manufacturer, anyone who does hardware wanted to make that kind of decision,
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.540]   as I was saying earlier, they physically cannot.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:57.180]   It would take years to rejigger their manufacturing capabilities.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.500]   As we've said many times, I don't even know that they could, maybe in Vietnam or India,
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.780]   who knows.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:08.460]   But currently, if they did that, that's the point I think we were trying to make.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:15.340]   They are being in practice held hostage by the Chinese government because of their involvement
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.340]   there.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:22.380]   I think we can't really throw that stone too hard because when they started this a few
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:27.140]   years ago or a couple of decades ago, we all thought, "This is great.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.140]   China isn't so bad.
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.980]   It's going in the right direction."
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:35.060]   Right now, not only is the Hong Kong thing happening, but they literally have concentration
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.300]   camps for Uyghur Muslims.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:43.580]   I think that's where I meet Brianna on this issue.
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:48.940]   I think at some point, yes, the company's role is to make money, but there has to be
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.620]   a line somewhere.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:54.620]   I don't know where that line is.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.700]   Patrick, I would say China's behavior is...
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.140]   Go ahead, sorry.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.940]   I would say China's behavior seems like it is getting very close to that line if not
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.740]   over it now.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.020]   I would say, Patrick, I'm very proud to call you a friend.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.380]   I love your stuff.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.580]   Just you're amazing.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.860]   But I think I would disagree with you here.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:22.660]   I think it's a false choice to say Apple has to pull its entire manufacturing base out of
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.820]   China or hold a line on this one individual issue.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:35.900]   Leo, to your point, I would argue it's counterproductive for Apple's long-term business strategy if
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:42.060]   it chooses to enable actions like the crackdown on Hong Kong protesters.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:48.700]   I think that is fundamentally against the values I buy into when I buy Apple devices.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.140]   I buy it for privacy.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:56.820]   I buy it for curated experiences, very thought through and responsible environmental policies
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.300]   and social policies.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:06.420]   I think where I would just fundamentally disagree with you here is when Google went into China
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.740]   and they started providing a search engine function there, they had to make certain compromises
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:17.500]   like heavily censoring Tiananmen Square, the most censored topic in all of China.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.780]   That is a business decision I can understand.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:28.140]   Where I don't understand it is when China is influencing our companies here in the United
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:33.500]   States and saying, "You need to in America stick to our values here."
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:38.020]   I think if they are coming and operating in our part of the world, they need to understand
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:43.420]   America just doesn't roll that same way.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:50.540]   One of the things Tim Cook said in the memo that he sent to Apple employees is, "It's
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:59.820]   better for us to be in China trying to change things than to pull out."
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:04.860]   This was when I in the 60s, this was a common trope.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:11.100]   I'd rather work within the government to change it than to be outside protesting.
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:18.100]   Is that what you're saying that it's better for Apple to participate with China in hopes
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.060]   of changing it?
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:26.580]   Is there any hope of changing China or is that Chamberlain saying the Hitler, "You take
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.500]   Czechoslovakia, we'll be fine.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.500]   We'll be fine."
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.860]   It's appeasement is the term people use.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.140]   We don't know two decades ago.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.900]   That's what was happening.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:42.260]   It's looking like not so.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:48.860]   When is the 17th anniversary of the Communist Party in China in a few weeks?
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.580]   That might be why Xi Jinping is doing all this so strongly.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:58.620]   It might be that he's afraid of Hong Kong, but he also got himself elected president
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.620]   for life.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:06.260]   He's persecuting the Uighurs in a way that is very strong.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.220]   We don't know, but it's not looking good.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:13.220]   It's not just we can, these are things we can live with.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.220]   I feel we get into personal feel.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.340]   They had their big military parade last week.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.180]   It was the 70th anniversary.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:24.100]   I just think that it's an important thing for Tim Cook to remember that history has
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.900]   a long memory.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.020]   These are challenging things for us to decide today.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:34.820]   This is something, well, think about IBM, which as recently as 2001 had to put out a
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:43.980]   press release about how its hardware was used by the Nazis to help persecute Jews.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:49.500]   Those things last a long time and they can be a blot on the reputation of a company for
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.940]   many, many decades.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:52.860]   I'm going to take a break.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:39:01.580]   When we come back, I think there is, what do they call it, a warrant canary when a company
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:06.700]   puts out a press release that says, "We haven't heard from the FBI," and then if they take
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.420]   that line out, that means they've heard from the FBI and be told they couldn't tell anybody
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.820]   they've heard from the FBI.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:17.220]   There is something Apple's doing today that I think will be telling.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:21.540]   Apple's response to this will tell us a lot about its long-term intentions.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.780]   I'm going to talk about that when we come back, but first we've got to take a break.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.860]   This is such an important conversation.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.100]   We're going to continue it after the break.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:35.620]   I do have to interrupt because it's only a two-hour show.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:39.380]   I think it's so important that we talk about this and I know it's challenging and I don't
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.460]   know if I know the right answer.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.020]   I really don't.
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:48.020]   I think there's good people on both sides.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.020]   That's Breanna Wu.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.020]   Sorry, Breanna.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.260]   That's Breanna Wu, candidate for U.S. Congress, Massachusetts.
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.140]   Eighth, love having you on the show.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.300]   Thank you for coming in.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:02.820]   Thank you also, Patrick Bezia for joining us in the middle of the night in France.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.380]   It's not much earlier in the UK.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.980]   Thank you, Nate Langston.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.540]   If this is a great show to have an international panel on.
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:15.060]   In fact, I wish we had a Chinese journalist on, but of course he'd be shot afterwards,
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.580]   so we didn't want to do that to anybody.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.700]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.300]   It's time to buy a new house.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.740]   It's time to get a loan, right?
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.420]   That's the biggest check you're ever going to write.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.020]   Of course, you got to get a loan.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.340]   I want you to do it from the right company.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.860]   Quick and Loans, Rocket Mortgage.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.140]   It's hard to find the right house.

[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.940]   We've been talking about Rocket Mortgage for a few years.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.460]   I have talked to many of you who have used them.
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.540]   Their team really cares about getting you home.

[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.980]   Tell me about Tencent.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.380]   This is a Chinese company, right?
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.660]   They're owned by...
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.860]   Are they privately owned?
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.340]   Who owns them?
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.340]   Do we know?
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.660]   I believe they are privately owned.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:24.060]   Tencent and Netty's are two gigantic gaming companies from China that have been in the
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.580]   company investing.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:32.740]   They got their start, I believe, by partnering with Western companies coming in China because,
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:37.260]   of course, a Western company needs a Chinese partner to come into the country.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.340]   Netty's was working very closely with Blizzard on many games.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.340]   I believe Tencent is working with them on others.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:51.340]   Both of them have started investing heavily in Western studios as well as many other things,
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.140]   developing things internally.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:06.100]   It seems like, for the past year, every week we heard about a massive investment from Tencent
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:12.140]   or Netty's in the gaming space in America or Europe.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:19.300]   It was millions and millions of dollars flowing in every year, I'm sorry, every week.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:25.220]   And so obviously it doesn't mean that they own the speech of all of those companies they
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.380]   have invested in.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:33.080]   But given what's been happening in the past few days and weeks, I think that the fact brings
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   a pause to us.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.580]   Here's why it's come up.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:40.300]   So, Tencent, by the way, owns China's first online-only bank.
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.700]   It's much more than gaming now.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.020]   It's hundreds of industries.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.020]   Yes.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:48.700]   They're the ones who signed the $700 million deal with the NBA to stream American basketball
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.300]   games in China.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:54.300]   Those games, by the way, blocked immediately after Houston Rockets General Manager tweeted
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.020]   in support of Hong Kong.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.980]   They do cars.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.700]   They do everything.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:05.180]   They are in the top 10 of the world's most valuable companies.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.980]   Here's why I bring this up.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:16.860]   This story just recently came out good research from a website called ReclaimTheNet.org.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:24.140]   If you're using an iPhone, Safari is sending the addresses, the IP addresses of sites you
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:28.380]   visit to Tencent.
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.860]   They send it to Google Safe Browsing.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.100]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.220]   They're trying to figure out if it's malicious.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.900]   But Tencent has something called Safe Browsing.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:43.140]   If you look at your privacy settings in Safari, it says before visiting a website, Safari
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:49.620]   Mesa and Information calculated from the website address to Google Safe Browsing and Tencent
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.500]   Safe Browsing to check if the website is fraudulent.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.340]   These Safe Browsing providers may also log your IP address.
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:02.800]   We talk a lot about protecting yourself from your ISP, protecting yourself from bad guys
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.900]   on the Wi-Fi.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:09.700]   Every site you visit is being sent to China by Apple.
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.420]   Now, I want to show you how you can turn that off.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.060]   It's on by default.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:22.740]   In an iPhone, you go to Safari, Settings, and you'll see under Privacy and Security, probably
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:29.420]   the most insecure setting on your iPhone, the fraudulent website warning.
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.580]   That's not secure.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.180]   That's not protecting you.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:38.860]   That's sending every site you visit to China.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.740]   I think of this as a canary.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.780]   I think now that we know this, I want to see what happens.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:51.100]   I want to see if Apple turns that feature off because that does not enhance your security
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.620]   in any way.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:46:00.860]   Yeah, I think Google definitely has a role that they play as far as infrastructure.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.580]   As a developer, with the last game I shipped when we were checking to see if you had iCloud
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.580]   access.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:12.940]   Google actually provided an IP that we could ping all day long on every single device that
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.340]   they gave to us.
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:18.060]   We could do it to see if there was an internet connection by trying to ping Google.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:22.420]   I knew that we were sending that Google had safe browsing.
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:23.820]   I knew that my browser was sending.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.060]   I think that was a good thing.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.580]   I left that turned on.
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:31.700]   But as of iOS 12, all of a sudden, it's sending it to China.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:32.700]   Right.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:33.700]   I think that's--
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.700]   I think that's--
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.700]   That's unimaginable.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.700]   If I could tell--
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.980]   Well, that's the question.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:45.060]   So safe browsing, the idea is you would run every site you're going to visit to make sure
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.900]   it doesn't have malware on it.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:47.900]   That was the idea.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.580]   Google and its crawl will detect malware.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.860]   That's why you get that pop up, right?
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.140]   And to detect if it's a fraudulent site.
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.140]   So it's not clear what Apple's doing.
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:02.860]   It's set for that one privacy statement that they may send information calculated from
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:03.860]   the website address.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.300]   That's the IP address.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:10.020]   To Google safe browsing and Tencent safe browsing to check if the website is fraudulent.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.620]   It's not going to work unless they send every single site there.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.620]   Yep.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:21.180]   What I was going to say, Leo, is I have seen-- I've heard stories from both big and small
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:28.580]   tech companies about what the outcome is of Tencent putting investment in the studio.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.700]   And in some cases, it's been very hands-off, not a big deal.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.180]   In others, it's been incredibly heavy-handed.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:40.580]   There's one studio where they came in and they wanted to do cultural checks on everything
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.580]   they're doing.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:47.420]   Members of the team are like, you know, staying up until 3 a.m. to have meetings with Tencent
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.420]   in China.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:53.580]   And there's the language barrier and trying to get OK is on art style and all these different
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.740]   things.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:48:00.140]   And that's a tendency I've seen with both very large institutions and smaller ones.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:05.820]   So I think I could see, whereas Apple working with Google on that, Google plays more of
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.100]   an infrastructural role.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:13.060]   It's hard for me to see a valid reason to send that information to Tencent.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:18.940]   So I saw that story and it really gives me pause because it's hard to imagine what good
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.700]   that would be used for.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:28.420]   I don't see any context that that could be considered safer than not doing that.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.340]   And that's surprising to me that Apple made this change in iOS 12.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:41.900]   And Matthew Green, a cryptographer, says, "Wait, Apple's sending URLs to Tencent?
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.500]   I mean, this is really fairly shocking."
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:52.140]   I mean, we don't know a lot about this, but they don't send identifying information along
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.140]   with that idea.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.140]   We don't know.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.140]   I guess.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.140]   We don't know.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.140]   Apple doesn't say.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:03.260]   Matthew says, "I know Google uses some weak, K-anonymity solution to provide some degree
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.420]   of privacy.
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.420]   How about Tencent?
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.700]   No one knows.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.700]   No one knows."
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.780]   And Apple has not said, "And why would Apple suddenly put this in and not tell us?"
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:18.140]   By the way, Green, who is a well-respected cryptographer at Johns Hopkins, says, "Safe
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.300]   browsing," was never safe.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.740]   It was a calculated risk-reward trade-off based on certain assumptions about the behavior
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:25.740]   of Google.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:33.220]   Replacing Google with Tencent requires a whole new set of calculations as Apple done them.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:37.180]   It's interesting because when they announce a new privacy feature, he points out they
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:42.140]   do it on stage with hundreds of reporters applauding.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:48.780]   But when you want to send all your browsing to China, they do that without telling anybody.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.660]   It's very upsetting.
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.900]   Do you think they'll do something about this?
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.220]   Now that this has come out?
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:50:03.620]   Well, the mood around China now is such that I think everyone who gets cold out on anything
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.620]   will have to at least appear to be doing something.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.820]   Appear, yeah.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.780]   So you might want to folks, you might want to look in your browser, and if it's sending
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:16.820]   your IP addresses to China, you might want to turn that off.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:25.300]   But best, it's a privacy violation.
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:30.300]   It's just discouraging to see Apple making this decision.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.900]   This has not been a great month for Apple.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.620]   Overall, iOS 13 came out rather.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.260]   The first two versions of it were an absolute disaster.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.980]   It broke every device I had.
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:46.100]   I actually got sent 30 minutes out of town because of my map froze.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:52.020]   I actually had to pull over on the side of the road and have my car physically reboot.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:56.940]   By unhooking the battery, that's how bad the new version of iOS crashed car play and
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:57.940]   my car.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:58.940]   Oh, wow.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.940]   And it's-
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:03.060]   You had to disconnect your battery and reboot your car.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:07.820]   I had to reboot my Porsche Cayman, and it was a disaster.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:14.140]   My point here is Apple used to be a company that I really felt like I could trust to do
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.140]   the right thing.
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:19.060]   And this is just- It's a very, very concerning development.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.060]   Wow.
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.060]   No kidding.
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.500]   Although, rebooting your Porsche does not sound good.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:33.060]   According to the BuzzFeed, in early 2018, Eddie Q of Apple told some Apple TV show developers
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:36.860]   not to anger China.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.500]   So this is not- I mean-
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.060]   He won't have been the first Leo.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:43.460]   He will not have been the first.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:49.500]   And I'm sure I'm angering China, but I don't have any economics taken in China.
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:54.500]   So wow, it's discouraging.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.500]   I think that's the-
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.100]   You've won an interesting take on that.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.140]   Take a look at one of the recent South Park episodes.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.660]   It's called Band in China.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:07.460]   Firstly, it has an excellent death metal band in it, who I think are actually from Britain.
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:11.460]   But also, it's a very interesting take on that specific.
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.060]   They've always been willing to take on the tough issues, right?
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:17.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:23.660]   I think that's a takeaway from this week's tech events is we're all realizing, for some
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.500]   reason it all happened at the same time.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:33.900]   And we're all realizing that the investments in China in many different ways are now coming
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:40.060]   with the toll is due, the bell is ringing, whatever metaphor you want to use.
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.660]   And we're realizing what it's costing.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:52.340]   I do want to mention that from my perspective, I'm often an apologist for big companies.
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:57.060]   So maybe it's not accurate, although I've been quite harsh on them today.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:03.940]   I think I want to underscore again the fact that 15, 20 years ago, we felt like it was
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.420]   probably a good move to do all of this.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:12.340]   And it's in recent years that things have gotten really bad and that we're realizing
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.740]   what's been happening now.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:22.260]   So companies investing in China 15, 20 years ago or even 10 years ago, it felt like a win,
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:23.260]   win, win for everyone.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:29.100]   Of course, China was, you know, coming this somewhat unsavory government, but it wasn't
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:31.460]   as bad as it's become now.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.860]   So it's good to keep it.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:33.980]   I don't know what to think about it.
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:39.580]   I honestly understand if you're a company doing business in a country that you have
[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.540]   a requirement to follow the laws of that country or leave the country.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.020]   There's really not a middle ground, right?
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:50.460]   But it bleeds into our, I don't know, society ecosystem, everything you want to say between
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:55.940]   the Chinese apps that are coming here, well, TikTok, at least one, and what they're imposing
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.940]   on a global audience.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:03.940]   It's not like in the 60s, when we liked American movies and we played them in France, it was
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:07.180]   still American movies we would choose to watch.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.780]   It's not the same now.
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:13.740]   As we were saying before, the movies are being produced with China in mind.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:19.300]   And if China is a totalitarian regime that sells you, you can say this and not that.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:26.660]   If you want the movie to be showing in the country, the effect is global and it has to
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.060]   be considered in a different way, I think.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:32.420]   Patrick, I do have to say this, though.
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:38.780]   I am coming at this as someone who's specifically running for office to strengthen our cybersecurity,
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:42.260]   our national security when it comes to technology issues.
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:48.020]   And when I see something like TikTok, which is a 100% Chinese-owned social media service
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:53.460]   that younger people are using, giving massive amounts of data, what they're interested in,
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:58.340]   what they look at on the screen for how many milliseconds, that's something that really
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:05.780]   gives me pause because you're giving a country that isn't always our friend a massive amount
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.940]   of information on our population.
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:14.420]   So I think this is not just a business situation, this is not just a cultural situation.
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:19.300]   There's also a national security discussion to be had here.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:25.980]   The wars of 2020 and beyond are going to be fought less with tanks and bombs and more
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.740]   with information.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.500]   This is information warfare.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:37.900]   So there's a very adult conversation that we need to have in America if everyone who
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:45.500]   uses an iPhone is having the IP addresses of the website, say, visit, broadcast to Tencent.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:51.980]   There's a very adult conversation we need to have if everything I say in a Fortnite
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:56:01.260]   game could potentially be accessed by another somewhat hostile foreign power.
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:04.700]   That's something we really, really need to have a discussion about.
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:06.540]   And I don't think we have in this country.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.780]   I mean, it's not just China.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:14.420]   There's authoritarian regimes in Turkey, in Russia.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:20.780]   They seem not to be unwilling to try to influence us in a lot of different ways.
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.980]   The United States is by its nature a very open country.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:29.220]   And should we tell kids don't use TikTok?
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:32.260]   It feels wrong to ban TikTok in the United States.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:37.340]   Just as it kind of felt wrong to ban Huawei, on the other hand, it's kind of insecure to
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.020]   use Huawei.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.980]   It's a real challenge.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.060]   It's a challenge.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:48.820]   But I mean, we have, when Disney has a website, they have to go through and make sure that
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:54.740]   child, if they're underage, they don't collect certain parts of information about those children.
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.460]   This is where regulation comes in.
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:00.340]   Of course, I don't want to say, if you're a teenager, don't use TikTok.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:04.660]   That would be counterproductive because teens would then run to go use TikTok.
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:10.660]   But what we can do is pass a legal framework that's thinking critically about these issues.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:14.580]   Do we have to build a great firewall of the US?
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:21.020]   Is China has built a great firewall of China to protect our citizens from information warfare?
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.020]   No.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.580]   That seems like the wrong way to go.
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:29.300]   And that's the problem when you're faced with an authoritarian regime.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.660]   Sometimes it feels like the best defense is to become authoritarian yourself.
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.900]   And I would not like to see us do that.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:40.940]   But we can pass a version of GDPR here in this country that's smarter and better and doesn't
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:45.580]   hurt small businesses and keeps individuals' information more private.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.740]   We can do that.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.220]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:55.860]   At what point do we admit that we have been in for at least the past five to ten years
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.340]   a multi-state informational war?
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.660]   Well, we have, haven't we?
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:01.660]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:02.660]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:06.780]   But again, I celebrate the fact that we have freedoms here in the United States and it
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:11.260]   would be a mistake to curtail our freedoms.
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:12.620]   But that's what happens in war.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:14.940]   And that's one of the reasons to declare war, right?
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:15.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:20.140]   No, but that's exactly the point of what's happening with China's influence through investments,
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:26.100]   through its attractiveness financially and the potential growth, which is huge.
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:32.300]   What is happening is that it's not just China that is, and I can't believe that I'm beating
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:41.260]   that drum so much, but it's not just China that is targeting foreign powers.
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:43.060]   It's through its influence.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:49.980]   It's making the actors from those foreign powers alter their behavior in a way that
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:51.140]   benefits it.
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:54.140]   And I think that is a little bit different from what we've seen.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:59.860]   That's different from the Belt and Road Initiative where they're kind of using, as we have,
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:05.700]   as the US is for years, foreign aid to influence nations, to build economic relationship with
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:07.940]   the nations, that seems okay.
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:12.900]   But to say, let's chill free speech in the United States so they don't say anything bad
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:17.180]   about China, that seems devious and not okay.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:23.660]   Where would you stand though on building a DNS wall blocking traffic bound to China from
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.660]   the US?
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.260]   Where would that, that doesn't seem like the right answer.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:27.260]   That's a terrible idea.
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:28.260]   Terrible idea.
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:29.260]   Yeah.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:30.660]   What's the firewall?
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:37.020]   The way we do it is exactly how we're, Facebook just today or it was last night, the settlement
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:45.420]   that they came to for inflating video views by 900% versus what they really were.
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:48.500]   We find them civilly a lot of money.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:52.660]   So what I would do is I don't think it's helpful to make anything criminal.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.580]   I think you open up companies for civil liability.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:58.940]   You say, these are the standards with information.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.120]   This is how you can share it.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.140]   This is how you need to analyze it.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.900]   These large data sets.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.420]   And if they're caught breaking those rules, you open them up to civil liability.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:11.300]   And then the people, in fact, they get a check just like Equifax should do.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:16.140]   But I got to point out the $40 million fine that Facebook gave.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.140]   It's a joke.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:22.780]   Is such a small fraction of the amount of money they made by inflating by 900% that if
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:26.060]   I'm Mark Zuckerberg, I'm saying, well, that's the price of doing business.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.500]   Let's keep doing it.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:32.500]   It doesn't, which is why you need regulation every time I come on this show.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.380]   But regulation doesn't do anything if you don't have teeth.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.060]   And what teeth could we use?
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.980]   And with teeth.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.980]   Well, what would the teeth be?
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.380]   Money, obviously $40 million fine.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.060]   It's like nothing.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.060]   It's a joke.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.860]   Let me tell you another little.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.180]   We're now in Europe and in France.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.300]   Hold on a.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:59.620]   We're now talking in percentage of revenue as maximum fines.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.620]   Yes.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.620]   That's getting very tested.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:05.380]   2% of revenue is the top fine in the GDPR.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.380]   That's pretty good.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.260]   Go ahead, Nate.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:13.100]   It was just on the topic of a joke because every time that this comes up, I think back
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:21.820]   to maybe it was around 2015, maybe 2016, I was looking at some numbers and Facebook made
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:29.700]   more money from the government body that promotes paying your taxes than Facebook paid
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.300]   in tax that same year.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.300]   Oh, God.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.580]   So, you know, I can't remember what the figures were now.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.060]   If the top of my head, it was a while ago.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:42.620]   But essentially, yeah, the government was paying for Facebook ads to say, hey, pay your
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:48.540]   taxes and Facebook made more money just from those ads than it paid in UK tax.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.540]   They're in the right business.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:59.180]   It is their fiduciary responsibility to make as much money as possible and to use the laws
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.580]   as well as they can to do that.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.380]   And of course, they should.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.060]   And that is absolutely the way it should work.
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:11.660]   And when they locate everything in Ireland and optimize their taxes to pay as little
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:17.740]   as possible following the law in the letter, if not in the spirit, then I think that's fine.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:25.820]   And that's why we need to make the laws more corresponding to the actual situation of the
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:26.820]   economy now.
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.980]   And that's what we're doing in.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:36.620]   I mean, but that's why we got to get the influence of money out of politics in the US.
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.860]   That's why the tax laws are the way they are.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:43.580]   That's why if you're a giant mega corporation, if you're one of the top 400 richest families
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:51.100]   in the United States, you pay less tax than anybody in the middle class because they've
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.900]   bought the we got the finest Congress money can buy.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:03:01.900]   Now you Patrick always take the side of regulation because you come from socialist Europe.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.900]   Absolutely.
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:09.420]   And by the way, in France, I'm considered a horrible capitalist who defends big corporations
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:14.740]   all the time, haven't done a great job showcasing that on this show, but I guess I do usually.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.380]   No, we love you.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:20.620]   And I'm glad I always glad to have you on because that's an important point of view that really
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.700]   should be argued, I think.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:28.580]   I think, I mean, I'm sure Brianna would agree, the corporations are not going to do more
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:31.900]   than what the law obliges them to when they shouldn't.
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.940]   That is how it should work, which is why I always have a problem.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:39.500]   They shouldn't be allowed to do is lobby so that the laws favor them.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.500]   Right.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.980]   I think it's so much worse than that though.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:48.380]   I mean, I think that look at the Science Space and Technology Committee in Congress,
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:54.700]   look at our discussion around net neutrality, for instance, you, I'm not trying to be aged
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.100]   here, but you do have older elected representatives.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.820]   They're not native to these things.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:04.900]   They're certainly nice interested in it as the people on the show are today.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:09.620]   And I think that has a consequence when their information on net neutrality is coming from
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:12.740]   AT&T and Verizon and lobbyists.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:19.500]   So I think it's a function of, with all respect, a generation of leaders that just is not as
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.500]   interested in this.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.100]   You have a picture of Elizabeth Warren up.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.180]   She is an exception to those.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.180]   I was so impressed.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:31.820]   Elizabeth Warren, Senator Warren running for president also, says to curb lobbying power,
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:35.780]   she wants to reinstate something that Newt Gingrich got rid of, the Office of Technology
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.780]   Assessment.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:44.460]   It's old job was to inform members of Congress about technology so that they could vote intelligently.
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.420]   Newt Gingrich got rid of it.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:52.100]   And I'm just impressed Elizabeth Warren even knows that the OTA existed.
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.300]   The fact that she wants to bring it back, Bravo, Bravo.
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:05:03.700]   We have a white paper about this.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:10.820]   That way it's not politicians voting on what's going to come after AES-256 as far as their
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.300]   military encryption.
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.020]   I think we get Mozilla and other stakeholders.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:20.820]   You can expect Bernie Sanders to know about AES-256.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:26.300]   But you can assume that your members of Congress are intelligent enough when properly briefed
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:32.660]   by a nonpartisan group on the technology to make an informed vote.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:38.460]   I think we've got to bring in stakeholders for this that do operate in this space.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:41.460]   Academics, lawyers, people actually work at these corporations.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:47.140]   The problem is the stakeholders who are brought in right now are the companies like Comcast
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:50.580]   and AT&T who, yeah, they're stakeholders.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.980]   Would you include them in these conversations?
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.820]   I think you have to.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.340]   You would to some degree.
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:06:01.500]   What I worry about is you've got to rebuild the OTA, but in a way that as much as it's
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:06.740]   possible insulates it from being politically hijacked by the less or the right.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.900]   Encryption is a mathematical question.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.980]   And we have a very serious question in this country.
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:18.420]   What kind of encryption standards are we going to mandate once quantum computers start
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.380]   becoming more realistic?
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:23.860]   That's going to break a lot of kinds of encryption, including our military encryption.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:29.740]   We were talking about this at our last pass event in Boston last week.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:34.740]   And we had very smart Steve Gibson and Bill Cheswick's smart people on stage who really
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:35.940]   knew this stuff.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.620]   And I was very encouraged.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.420]   First of all, I said, "Oh, quantum computing."
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.420]   That's not going to happen.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.420]   They said, "No, no, it's happening.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.260]   In fact, it exists."
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:47.500]   But the good news is crypto folks have been thinking about this for a decade.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.020]   They've known it was coming.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.860]   They have good solutions.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:56.460]   And they said, "Right now, one of the best solutions, just double your key size."
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:00.220]   I said, "Oh, I'm 4096."
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.020]   They said, "You already doubled it.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.020]   You're good.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.020]   You're golden.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.580]   Double your key size, folks.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.580]   That's it.
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.020]   It used to be 2048.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.020]   Make it 4096."
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.980]   I said, "Well, should I make it 8192?"
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.300]   They said, "No, no, no.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.300]   Let's not get crazy here."
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.580]   But we need people working in that space.
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:22.420]   We need somebody who understands that and can explain it and make these appropriate choices.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:25.060]   I actually trust the military and the Pentagon.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.820]   I know that they are very well run.
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:36.660]   And if you don't let politicians get involved, they will certainly make the right choices.
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:41.860]   I call you on this every time I'm on the show and I'm not going to stop now, Leo.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:48.580]   You keep you and every other American I've ever heard except maybe for Brianna.
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.020]   Anytime you talk about politicians, you dismiss them.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:55.500]   Well, that's because of the quality we have here in the United States.
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.500]   No, no, no.
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.500]   No, it's a politician.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.940]   So there are good politicians.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:04.340]   You see the flashy stuff.
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.780]   Your country runs pretty well.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.820]   I'm sure there are many things that you see that you're angry about that you hear.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.540]   The local minority is...
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:19.660]   Dude, you know our power was off for two days because our local investor owned power utility
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:23.300]   ignored infrastructure improvements.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.900]   So they had to turn off power in case the state burst into flame.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.900]   By the way, it burst into flame anyway.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:36.260]   So I don't know if I trust the competence of the political authorities, at least in our
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.580]   state.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:44.220]   I think it does a disservice to the political process and the well-being of your country
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:50.780]   if your default position is constantly to undermine the work of your politicians.
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:51.780]   No, no.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:57.700]   Because I think it has a perverse effect which people don't trust anything about politics
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:03.100]   in general, which means it doesn't matter, which means that people who are not qualified
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.100]   get...
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.100]   That's why people don't vote.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.940]   That's why people don't get involved.
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:07.940]   Exactly.
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:15.860]   In its best expression, politics and politicians are merely the society saying, "These are the
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.860]   thing...
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.860]   These are what we want.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.660]   These are how we forward our society.
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:22.180]   That's their job in its best expression."
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:28.860]   But I have to say, Patrick, you don't have any experience of the depth that money has
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.380]   changed our politics in this country.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.260]   I understand why people get disenchanted.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.260]   I agree with you.
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:40.140]   The way we should do in response is focus on what we can do to make it better, like getting
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.860]   money on the politics.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:43.940]   No, I agree with you.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:49.900]   This is why we have civilization because we've come up with ways that we as a group can
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:54.380]   decide what's best for the group and that's politics.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.220]   I feel the sentiment I get from the US constantly is it doesn't matter.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.780]   It's not going to get better.
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:05.420]   The reaction should be, in France, it's pretty bad as well, but not that bad.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:11.980]   We believe that the action of people is through government and elections and voting.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:15.500]   I feel like in the US it's tricked into...
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.420]   Yes, of course, exactly.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:23.020]   You have been tricked into a lot of the people into believing that it doesn't matter so you
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.420]   act against your own interests.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.820]   Not vote.
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:29.060]   I would say, Patrick, it is hard to do this job.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:32.940]   I would rather do engineering almost any day of the week.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:37.700]   The fundraising is exhausting being yelled at all the time is exhausting.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.940]   Having your motives for doing this work is exhausting.
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.140]   That said, I think it's fundamentally a problem of incentives.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.500]   Leo, I think you're dead on.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:54.780]   It is so much easier to go out to a corporate pack and just take that money, which my opponent
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:55.780]   is doing.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:58.660]   That funds over half of his campaign.
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:02.020]   He's going out and talking to people one on one.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:06.780]   I think there are a lot of people that get into this job for the right reasons.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.540]   They're genuinely concerned about their community.
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.980]   I just think it changes you over time.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:18.740]   I've seen people here in Boston that I think they used to be great and something just changed.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:24.100]   Well, because you spend so much time dialing for dollars, eventually, you understand,
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.180]   well, that's the job.
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.180]   Yep.
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:28.180]   That's unfortunate.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:32.580]   I guess the one issue I would agree is the most important one is to take the money out
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.580]   of one issue.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.220]   For us, I think so.
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.660]   We have limits on that.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:42.980]   It's so obvious for us that it has to be limited.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:45.740]   Let's take a little break.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.100]   I do want to talk about Facebook.
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:48.820]   Mark Zuckerberg will be going to the Hill.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:53.460]   He'll be testifying this time.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.020]   It's all about Libra.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:12:00.380]   It sure feels like the Facebook cryptocurrency is starting to fall apart.
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:03.060]   But we'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.860]   Somebody's saying, "What about the new Pixelbook Leo?"
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.380]   Yeah, we'll talk about Google's event.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.100]   It's coming up on Tuesday.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:12.340]   And a lot more Nate Langston is here from Bloomberg doing a great job, by the way.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:15.100]   Tech editor at Bloomberg, European Tech editor.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:21.100]   He's the host of UK TechShow at UKTechShow.com.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:26.900]   From FrenchSpin.com, our French compatriot, Patrick Bezia.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.140]   Notice I used a French word there.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.660]   Not Patrick on the Twitter.
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:36.220]   And from Massachusetts, glorious 8th district, dead in Massachusetts.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:38.540]   A candidate for US Congress, Branna Wu.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.740]   Great to have you.
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.300]   Branna Wu.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.900]   Our show today brought to you by Zapier.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.060]   I use Zapier.
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.540]   I love Zapier.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.540]   I like to code.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.860]   I think coding is cool.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.860]   I'm with you, Branna.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.780]   I'd rather code than almost anything else.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:58.580]   But I know there are a lot of people who want the benefits of computer automation, but aren't
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.580]   coders.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.820]   For you and me, frankly, there is Zapier.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:08.740]   This is the greatest way to automate all those mundane, boring, repetitive tasks.
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:13.100]   Zapier lets you build workflows to get things done.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.340]   It works with everything.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.700]   Tons of software, over 1,500 apps.
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:23.300]   Zapier is remarkable because it supports multi-step zaps.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:28.940]   So I'll give you an example of my Zapier I use all the time on this show.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:33.980]   I have a Zapier that watches my news feeder, my news reader, Ino Reader.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.620]   That Zapier supports Ino Reader.
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:40.380]   So when I favorite an article in my news reader, Zapier leaps into action.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:45.780]   Without any effort on my part, it takes the article, takes the information, it posts a
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:49.420]   tweet about it to my links for Twitter feed.
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.740]   It bookmarks it on Pinboard.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:57.620]   And then it adds a line to a spreadsheet on Google Sheets that I maintain with Carsten
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:59.860]   with all the show stories that we're going to cover.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:04.100]   It automatically puts the link in my description, my tags about which show I want it to be
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.100]   on.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.580]   This is all handled completely automatically by Zapier.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.900]   I love Zapier.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.380]   I've been using it for years.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.260]   I have all sorts of little zaps.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.740]   That's what they call these scripts.
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.100]   You don't have to be a coder.
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:21.140]   You just simply say, when this happens, do this and then this multi-step zaps, that's
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:24.780]   one of the things that makes Zapier so good.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:28.540]   Why waste your time doing repetitive things over and over again?
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.860]   If you do anything more than once, if you spend more than a few minutes doing it every
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.740]   week, get Zapier to do it.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.900]   More than four and a half million people use Zapier today.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:40.300]   And on average, each of them saves 40 hours a month.
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.460]   That's a whole work week.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:42.860]   They're getting back.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.180]   A whole work week.
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:49.540]   If you're in sales, you can have Zapier automatically engage leads, send out emails, import new
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:54.140]   customers into your contact list, notify your team, go out to Slack and say, "Hey, everybody,
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:55.620]   we got a new client.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:56.780]   This is all automatic.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:59.340]   You don't have to do those things you do over and over again.
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:00.260]   Let Zapier do them.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:01.660]   I love it.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:06.780]   Get yourself more time to enjoy life, to do the things you love, to grow your business.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.300]   Let Zapier handle them boring mundane tests.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:14.740]   Right now through November, try Zapier free by going to zapier.com/twitfree for two weeks,
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.940]   zapier.com/twit.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:23.020]   Think of all the things you can get done, z-a-p-i-e-r-zapier.com/twit.
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.260]   I'm a big Zapier fan.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:28.060]   It integrates with every app you use.
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.500]   And I think you're just going to love it.
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.060]   It's also fun.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:35.380]   And it's really satisfying when you can just go, "Done, job done."
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.340]   And it just runs for years sometimes.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:41.020]   The script that Carson and I have used is run for years.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.220]   Without any intervention on a part, it just works.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.220]   Zapier.com/twit.
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:48.780]   Let me thank them so much for supporting Twit.
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:52.140]   We thank you for supporting Twit by using that URL.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:56.860]   So Libra, we talked about it when Facebook announced this.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:00.900]   Facebook was at great pains to say, "Oh, no, it's not a Facebook cryptocurrency."
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:06.860]   We have the Libra, what do they call it, group of 30 companies.
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:07.860]   Association.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.860]   Association.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.500]   And they put in money and they participate.
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.700]   Except the association seems to be falling apart rapidly.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:21.940]   In one day, eBay, Visa, MasterCard, and Stripe all said, "Yeah, we never met."
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.740]   PayPal last week.
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:29.340]   These are all the big US fintech companies are saying, "Is it because Mark Zuckerberg
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:33.580]   is going to the Hill to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, October
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:34.580]   23rd?
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:35.580]   Is it that?
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:38.500]   Do they know something we don't know?
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.500]   Is it over for Libra?
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.500]   Well, it's not over.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.700]   God, I hope so.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.180]   Okay, Brianna Wu.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:47.420]   Why do you hope so?
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:54.220]   This is, it's rare you see an idea that's so bad you think it could fundamentally destroy
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.220]   your country.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.740]   And that's kind of how I feel about this.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:02.220]   I mean, if you look at how Facebook has handled our democracy, I don't even want to think
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:07.140]   about how they could handle our financial system.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:12.420]   Just as a candidate for Congress, I have to report every single dollar just about to get
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.580]   sent my way.
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.820]   Someone offered to send me a PS4 game today on Twitter.
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.940]   I had to make it clear publicly.
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:23.460]   This is Brianna Wu with the individual accepting this, not Brianna Wu with the candidate.
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:29.380]   Imagine how bad it would be if Facebook has this currency where anyone can send you untraceable
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.820]   money through cryptocurrency.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:33.820]   You can't.
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:34.900]   It doesn't have the credibility.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:39.980]   I couldn't bundle a bunch of cash in Manila envelope and mail it to you.
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:40.980]   How would I spend it?
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:43.860]   How would I put it in a bank to spend it from there?
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:44.860]   You couldn't?
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.860]   Sure.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:46.860]   So it's not possible.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:48.860]   I'm going to show up to TD Bank.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:49.860]   I was a cash.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:50.860]   I just put it in.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:52.780]   I don't know where it came from.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.180]   It just got to work.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:59.300]   I don't know the Federal Elections Commission, which by the way, I don't know if it exists
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.300]   anymore, but it's...
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.300]   It exists.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.300]   Okay, good.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.300]   That's good.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:05.300]   I'm glad I know.
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.300]   I don't see him.
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.300]   It's working right now.
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:08.300]   Okay.
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.260]   So they say you can't accept a donation that you can't say exactly who it came from.
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.260]   Right.
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:16.420]   I mean, I think the rule, if I remember correctly, I'm not a lawyer, but it's $20.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.620]   Anything like if a literal lady came up to me at church with a $20 bill, I could say this
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.220]   was an anonymous cash donation.
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.220]   Anything bigger than that?
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:27.340]   I have to report and track, which is why Julianne is in...
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.660]   Yeah, right.
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:32.060]   I think there are people who wish they could send you Bitcoin, but they can't...
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:35.620]   I think there's a way to do it, but it's reportable.
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.980]   I've not had that issue come up.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:41.860]   So if someone wants to donate in Bitcoin, get in touch with me, we'll figure out if
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:44.060]   that's legal or not.
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:45.660]   If someone sent you a check...
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:46.820]   Well, not a check.
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:47.820]   It's not anonymous.
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:53.260]   If they send you a pile of bills, you can say, "Well, I can't use this.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.900]   I don't want this."
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.500]   It's the same with Libra with any crypto.
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.820]   If you receive money, you could say, "I don't know where it came from.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.460]   When it came from, I don't want to use this.
[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:03.460]   It's not legal."
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:08.300]   Oh, Patrick, that is so sweet and naive that you take a politician who did that.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.300]   That is so sweet.
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.220]   No, I mean, you...
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:16.940]   If you would refuse legally, you can't accept money that you don't know where it came from.
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:20.780]   It's the same issue with bills and with Libra.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:25.620]   So Dave Marcus, who runs the Libra project for Facebook, came from PayPal.
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.340]   He was the president of PayPal.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:32.580]   PayPal was the first to bail last week.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:38.260]   He tweeted, "Special thanks to Visa and MasterCard for sticking it out to the 11th hour.
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:42.300]   The pressure has been intense understatement.
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:48.340]   And I respect the decision to wait until there's regulatory clarity for Libra to proceed versus
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:51.060]   the invoked threats by many on their biz.
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:55.780]   It sounds like the reason these companies are bailing is they're worried about the regulatory
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.780]   environment."
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:05.300]   I'm guessing they maybe they have something in the works because this is all of the payment
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.420]   companies that Libra...
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:09.420]   It's not going away.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.380]   I think Facebook really wants this to happen.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:12.380]   Maxine Waters...
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.620]   Who is the chairman of the committee?
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:18.860]   She wants her woman to the committee, said she wants Facebook to stop.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.860]   Stop.
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:21.260]   Well, stop it.
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:22.260]   Don't do it.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:26.580]   Yeah, she wants, but we'll have to see what happens legally and how they can make it
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.580]   stop.
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.220]   Maybe they will, but until they do.
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.220]   Fill me in.
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:31.220]   I'm ignorant.
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.220]   What's wrong with cryptocurrency?
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:34.660]   Well, I know one thing that's wrong, at least with Bitcoin.
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:39.620]   I don't know about Libra, but Bitcoin mining now is so costly in terms of energy.
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:43.220]   Of course, the cost keeps going up as you mine.
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:48.220]   Bitcoin mining today uses more energy worldwide than all the solar panels that have been
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:51.940]   stalled for the last 40 years.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:52.940]   That's not good.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:59.020]   Admittedly, it's hydroelectric and stuff, but it's not like it's energy neutral.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.620]   If you take the energy argument and I'll prevent...
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.140]   Yeah, let's take that out.
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.660]   I don't have an issue.
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:10.540]   In fact, I was very early on in my race talking out, I do think there's a role for integrating
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.500]   Bitcoin and cryptocurrency into our monetary system.
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:16.780]   I do think we need legal ways to do that.
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:22.900]   What I think the real difference is, Leo, is Bitcoin by design is decentralized.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:26.740]   If you're looking at the United States dollar and you're saying, "Oh, okay.
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:30.060]   I see these shenanigans going on financially.
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:35.460]   It makes sense to me personally to diversify my holdings and to get a certain amount of
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.460]   cash in Bitcoin."
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:38.460]   It's decentralized.
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.780]   That's an argument that makes sense to me.
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:46.860]   I think the criticism of Ethereum is it's tied to these exact same financial entities
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.100]   that crashed the economy in 2008.
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:54.060]   Then if you look at Facebook, it's a hyper centralized currency.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:22:00.820]   It's far closer, in my opinion, to Disney dollars than it is to an actual cryptocurrency, which
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:05.060]   I think should be decentralized.
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:10.500]   Do you want it to be decentralized, though, at least if something starts going wrong there,
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:16.460]   you have someone whom you can go and talk to who can influence the way the cryptocurrency
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:18.620]   works with Bitcoin.
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:24.300]   No one controls it unless you can get 51% of the miners together.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:28.220]   This feels that something much more dangerous.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.020]   I think that's a check on it.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.660]   Is that good?
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:36.660]   Check on it.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.700]   I think you look at which Bitcoin can process transactions.
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.660]   You can see clearly they need more leadership.
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:47.020]   I talk to the answer is to pass the keys to Facebook.
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.020]   Facebook more involved.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.340]   A DOP problem is Facebook.
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.340]   Facebook.
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:55.740]   They don't have the credibility on this.
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:00.060]   There's a lot to be said for cryptocurrency and it's anonymity, not for giving money to
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.060]   politicians.
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:06.660]   I think one of the reason people like crypto is because cash is disappearing.
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:10.100]   That was the last anonymous way to use money.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.220]   Every time you use a credit card, it's tracked.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:16.860]   People privacy advocates would love to be able to buy something at the local liquor store
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.140]   without everybody knowing.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.140]   I guess.
[01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:20.140]   I don't know.
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:27.980]   The problem I've always had with Facebook and Libra is trying to understand why Facebook
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.860]   wants to do it.
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:37.580]   Facebook relies on advertising for 98, 99% of all of its revenue.
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:39.660]   It's all advertising.
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:43.140]   It's not going to make any money from Libra, not directly.
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.980]   I don't believe.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:50.900]   But Facebook isn't doing this out of some inherent altruism or philanthropic goal.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:55.700]   It's doing it ultimately because it thinks it will make more money if it does.
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.260]   I don't care what it says about whether that's true or not.
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:02.180]   That is going to be true.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:08.260]   What is that ultimate goal of Libra for Facebook?
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:14.660]   I think Zuckerberg has talked about maybe enabling more communities to be able to build
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.620]   up their businesses in their communities.
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:21.500]   Maybe that then means they will ultimately be competing with each other and therefore
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.500]   need to spend advertising.
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.620]   I don't know if that was Zuckerberg or if that was a conspiracy theorist that I read
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:28.620]   online.
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:29.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:30.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:31.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:35.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:36.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:37.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:40.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:41.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:43.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:51.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:55.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:56.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:57.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:00.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:01.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:03.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:04.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:05.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:06.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:07.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:08.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:13.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:14.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:17.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:18.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:19.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:21.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:23.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:27.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:28.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:35.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:42.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:49.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:50.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:51.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:52.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:53.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:54.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:57.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:58.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:02.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:05.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:06.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:07.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:08.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:09.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:10.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:11.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:12.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:32.620]   I don't know if that was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:38.140]   Brave, which is another browser, started by Brendan Eich, formerly of Mozilla, has its
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:43.260]   own Brave currency, Brave Attention Tokens or BAT.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:47.660]   Their plan to use it, which I think is interesting, is to use it because it has an ad blocker
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:54.180]   built into the browser to compensate websites that you go to but aren't seeing their ads.
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:59.780]   You can pay them with BAT, which is an interesting idea.
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:04.900]   I just think about it's hard for me to not question Facebook's motives here.
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:09.420]   To me, let's get back to a story in the United States.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:14.860]   Russia purchased ads in rubles and it affected the United States election.
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:21.500]   Imagine how much harder it would be for investigators to find out about that activity and prosecute
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:28.700]   it if your only way of finding out about that is trusting Facebook's reports about it.
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:33.300]   Do you trust Facebook to report all of that, honestly, when there are banking regulators
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:37.740]   to go there and look at wire transfers and all these other things?
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:42.940]   It just seems like you're giving a massive amount of power to someone that shouldn't
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:43.940]   have it.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.900]   They want to keep you in that ecosystem.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:50.020]   They want to keep you in the Facebook ecosystem, which is why they push Facebook shopping and
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.020]   all these things.
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:53.820]   I just don't think they have the credibility for that.
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:28:01.220]   I don't think I've ever said a word a syllable publicly critiquing a theory.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:07.180]   It's because there's just more credibility with the people putting that forward.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:15.260]   It really is this company just flouting regulation in a way I think would be very bad for everyone
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.260]   involved.
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:20.820]   Is this the new normal is that as big tech companies are going to grab, they're going
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:25.820]   to try to grab, they're going to constantly grab because they're so big and they need
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:27.660]   to grow.
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:34.060]   They've got to the point now where really they can grow by just dominating something.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:38.900]   It's the government's job to slap their risk.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:39.900]   No.
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:41.700]   What are the cops over in the?
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:44.300]   What are the governments involved in Libra?
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:51.500]   What if governments got into that 100 entities association and got it?
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:59.460]   I think the fact that Facebook is doing this is kind of obscuring a potential upside of
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:07.020]   having a stable, non-energy-consuming, reliable cryptocurrency.
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:11.620]   It could be a good thing just like, as I was saying, HTML is a good thing and everyone
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:17.420]   can use it and do stuff with it.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:25.100]   I'm not sure I don't know enough to be certain, but I don't think technically Libra is a bad
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.100]   idea.
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:31.300]   Isn't having hundreds of different currencies a bad idea?
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:36.180]   Isn't the world eventually going to just say, "Well, we need some sort of global currency?"
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:41.020]   Yeah, I don't think the argument is that it's a bad idea.
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:45.140]   It could be a good idea, but in the hands of the wrong entity.
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:46.980]   That's the thing.
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:51.940]   Libra overseen by a different group or proposed by a different organization is a very different
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:55.340]   Libra to one proposed by Facebook.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.340]   Yeah.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:01.780]   Well, if you're every country but the United States, I would think you'd want something
[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:05.460]   besides the American dollar as well.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:07.980]   That's going to be the default choice, isn't it?
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:11.740]   I mean, Libra is just another option.
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.340]   And to answer your question, yes, we want different currencies that each country can
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.500]   control to control their economy.
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:18.780]   You're stuck with the Euro.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:21.380]   Was it a sad day when you gave up the French Frank?
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:27.500]   You're the only country that had bare-breasted women on their money.
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.180]   I think we still do.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.180]   Each country has different...
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:32.340]   Oh, the French Euro has Libra obtained?
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:33.820]   Yeah, I'm sure some of them.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:38.740]   I mean, it's Marianne, it's a symbol of the Republic.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:39.740]   It might still be there.
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:41.740]   That's why I love France.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:44.940]   It's the next positive currency I love.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:48.700]   The next positive currency.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:51.820]   Their Facebook's also in the news with their new free speech policy.
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:54.700]   We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.260]   But I want to show you these two phones.
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.260]   They look very similar.
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:00.100]   All phones look the same black glass.
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.620]   They can dial out.
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.060]   There's a big difference here.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:09.140]   This phone, I spend $90 a month to use to make calls, to make texts, to get data.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:12.700]   This phone, I spend $25 a month.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.340]   This is a phone running Mint.
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:16.980]   I love Mint Mobile.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:23.580]   If you're tired of giving all your money to your cell company, take a look at Mint Mobile.
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.860]   Mint Mobile is a reseller of T-Mobile.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:30.460]   So if T-Mobile works for you and your area, this is a really great choice.
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:35.180]   Your bill could be as low as $15 a month for the same exact premium coverage you get
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:37.140]   from T-Mobile.
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:39.140]   You get unlimited calling.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.660]   You get unlimited text.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.980]   You can use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.340]   Keep your same phone number if you want.
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:45.740]   Port it over.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:47.460]   You can also buy a phone to work with it.
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:53.540]   Every plan comes with crazy fast LTE plus nationwide talk and text unlimited.
[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:58.780]   And if you're on, for any reason, not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has a seven day money
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.300]   back guarantee.
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:01.980]   I think this is the future.
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.740]   This is the way to go.
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.300]   You can keep your number if you want.
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:06.620]   You can get a new number.
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:07.780]   You can get a new phone.
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:08.780]   You can keep your phone.
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:10.420]   They sell phones.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:15.020]   If you're not 100% satisfied, no problem, but I think you will be.
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:16.020]   Get a new wireless plan.
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:18.100]   In fact, they've got a special deal for you because you're listening to Twitter.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:24.020]   If you go to mintmobile.com/twit, $15 a month with their three month introductory plan and
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.420]   they'll ship it all to your door for free.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:27.740]   No charge even for the SIM.
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:31.180]   Can you believe companies charge you for a SIM so you can use their service?
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:33.020]   Not Mint Mobile.
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:35.540]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:36.980]   Cut your wireless bill.
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.340]   Get the same great service you're used to.
[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.860]   I just love it.
[01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:42.540]   It just makes me feel good.
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:46.460]   Now the question is, well, why do I still have a plan with Verizon and AT&T and Sprint?
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:49.340]   Well, I got to test them, I guess.
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:53.220]   But, man, the minute I retire, it's all going mint.
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:54.340]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:59.380]   Well, thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:02.020]   We thank you for supporting us by using that URL.
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:03.020]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:06.100]   So, I don't know what to think about this.
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:13.580]   It's actually not so different from the rules the FTC enforces on broadcast media.
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:22.500]   Facebook says you can lie in your ads, but only if you're a politician.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.980]   Does that sound crazy?
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:29.660]   You would never lie in your ads, Brian.
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:30.820]   I know.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:36.140]   We actually thought, and I was so upset about this, that Elizabeth Warren did this idea while
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:38.740]   we literally had the script and were producing it.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:39.740]   Oh, shit.
[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:45.860]   I wanted to produce an ad, and we wanted to use one of these NLP deep learning algorithms
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:48.860]   to create a fake person.
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:53.220]   Because I had the whole Alec Jones thing, and we wanted to be very conservative here.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:34:00.300]   So we wanted to do this and then come out and say, "Politician X came through and has
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:06.580]   ties to XYZ and has been making methamphetamine and just have it be the most ridiculous lie
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.820]   you could possibly imagine."
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:11.980]   And then we'd say, "None of this is true.
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:16.100]   We can say literally anything we want because this is Facebook.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.460]   No one is fact checking this.
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:21.980]   Facebook needs to be held to the same standards as broadcast media."
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:23.740]   And I thought that would be a great ad.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:25.580]   And Elizabeth Warren did it first.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:30.780]   Yeah, she did it even better, I think, because she punked Mark Zuckerberg saying, putting
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:34.620]   a picture of Mark Zuckerberg and President Trump saying, "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:38.740]   endorsed President Trump," which I thought was a great punk.
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.460]   She bought the ad, no problem.
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:44.380]   Even though, by the way, the ad violates Facebook's rules in another way, you're not
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.140]   supposed to say Facebook in an ad.
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:49.020]   You can't use the Facebook trademark in an ad.
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:50.780]   So here's the thing.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:56.860]   There is a truth in advertising law enforced by the FTC.
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:59.820]   So commercial companies can't lie in an ad.
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:08.020]   But the FCC allows politicians even on broadcast media to lie because an accord has upheld
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:09.260]   this.
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:13.380]   And I think this makes sense to me because the government shouldn't be involved in determining
[01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:16.900]   what's true and what's not true in an ad.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:21.300]   So as long as the ad is sourced, which that's the other part of federal law, that's why
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:25.820]   it says, "My name is Brianna Wu, and I endorse this."
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:26.820]   What do you have to say?
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:27.820]   I endorse it.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:29.580]   You actually don't have to say it in a digital ad.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:31.820]   No, you have to say it in a podcast.
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:34.380]   But you don't have to say it in digital because the rules are different.
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:37.900]   But in broadcast, you have to get your voice, right?
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:40.460]   And you have to say, "I approve this message."
[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.620]   Actually, who did our thing?
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.980]   It was Micah Sargent.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.540]   He did this ad paid for by Brianna Wu for Congress.
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:48.540]   He's our voice for that.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.740]   Oh, I thought it had to be your voice.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:53.940]   It's mine saying, "I'm Brianna Wu, and I approve this message."
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:54.940]   Oh.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:56.460]   So what did Micah do?
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:59.780]   He did this ad paid for by Brianna Wu for Congress.
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:02.180]   That's the digital thing.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:03.180]   It's a different thing.
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.540]   You have to have it in there.
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:06.100]   For digital?
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.420]   For some digital, yes.
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:14.820]   We act in a very legally, we try to do the most ethical thing we can at any time.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:19.260]   So the ads don't say it, but we willingly comply with the broadcast standards.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:23.900]   But coming back to the point about not wanting the government to be involved in these decisions,
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:29.100]   I agree with you, which is why I think it was a best case scenario when CNN looked at
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:34.500]   some of these ads and said, "We've looked at this and our network standards are not
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:39.940]   going to allow you to run this because it is beneath the standards we hold ourselves to."
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:41.860]   A private company could do so.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:42.860]   Right.
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:48.420]   Interestingly, MSNBC ran the Trump ad that people were upset about.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:52.260]   I saw it on NFL football.
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:55.020]   The only network in fact that said, "No, I think it was CNN."
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:56.020]   Correct.
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.740]   So what I would like to see Facebook do is partner up with someone that's a nonpartisan
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:05.380]   fact-checking organization and hold us to those standards.
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:09.260]   I think it would be good for democracy and good for the country.
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:13.580]   Slow down our process of putting out those ads because it is easy.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:18.180]   It is very profitable for us and put some breaks on that process.
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.060]   It's not going to hurt democracy.
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:22.580]   How is it in the UK right now, Nate?
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:27.260]   I think Boris Johnson drove a bus around for some time.
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:35.020]   I actually looked up the company that leased him that bus and found out that a subsequently
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:41.220]   leased it and recovered it to ironically promote international transfers of money between European
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:43.220]   countries and elsewhere.
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:47.100]   I wrote a little story about it for Bloomberg a couple of years ago.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:50.580]   Right now, obviously everything is around Brexit.
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:56.700]   I'm a big fan of the Facebook ad library and just putting random search terms in there
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:00.300]   that are tangentially linked to Brexit and seeing what comes back.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.020]   I think the library is worldwide.
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:05.860]   You've got that in the US as well.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:13.380]   I did a search for 2020 and there's over 50,000 results of ads on Facebook for the 2020 election.
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:18.100]   So I assume you can access that as well.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:21.100]   Everything on here is a standard format and it wouldn't be too difficult.
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:25.500]   I wouldn't have thought for the kind of company that Brianna was talking about to the scrape
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:28.660]   this or maybe Facebook even has an API for it.
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.140]   I'm not sure.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:38.380]   So this is the bus Boris Johnson drove all over Europe during the Brexit campaign.
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:45.060]   It's my understanding that this line, we send the EU 350 million pounds is actually a lie.
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:56.060]   It's basically it discounts the fact that we get a lot of that money back.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:03.060]   And so many people, including people who were pro Brexit have gone on the record and admitted,
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.700]   yeah, this was not true.
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:07.380]   It's compelling though.
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:09.900]   Let's fund our national health service instead.
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.380]   Let's put that money in.
[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:12.380]   That's compelling.
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:19.540]   I mean, you can't win more support for a cause than rallying behind the NHS in Britain, depending
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:25.300]   on which side of the political spectrum you are, but it's a beloved institution here.
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:29.620]   And it was always going to be the one that got people talking, but fundamentally that
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:32.620]   the number was flawed.
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:36.540]   But I say the damage it had done, I would say the in-
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:38.780]   So it wasn't illegal to do that though.
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:43.100]   There's no law against putting a lie on a bus and driving around.
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:50.860]   Well, there are laws against flat out lying in advertisements, but it depends who decides
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:56.220]   whether or not something is a lie or is just misleading and shouldn't be repeated.
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:40:01.340]   We have advertising standards agencies that will say if this ad is deemed to be misleading
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:03.940]   or inappropriate, you are not to run it again.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:08.740]   But by the time they've said something like that, then it's a dot.
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:13.180]   And there's no particular exemption for political ads.
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:15.260]   There are stricter rules for political ads.
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:16.260]   It's more strict.
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:17.260]   Okay, good.
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:18.260]   Yeah.
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:23.020]   I mean, someone did try and, you know, and took Boris to court for this.
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:25.020]   And I think the case was dismissed.
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:30.820]   It was thrown out or I can't remember how it was resolved, but certainly he didn't get
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:31.820]   thrown in jail.
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:36.260]   There's a bizarre, by the way, I'm just going to bring this up, a bizarre side note to this,
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:43.540]   which is the prime minister, Mr. Johnson, has given a number of odd interviews, including
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:47.900]   one in which he kind of offhandedly said, when asked, what do you do to relax, says,
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:48.900]   oh, I make things.
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:52.860]   I make models of buses, which is weird, right?
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:55.420]   I mean, really, that's what you do, Boris Johnson?
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:58.460]   In your spare time, you make bus models.
[01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:03.980]   And it has been speculated, I think accurately, that he does these things and he does it done
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:07.180]   other times to gain Google search results.
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:12.500]   He doesn't want you searching for Boris Johnson bus and finding an image of that lie.
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:17.020]   He would far prefer you find him saying, I make bottles of buses.
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:18.020]   Yep.
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:19.020]   You think that's true?
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:20.020]   He's got a very good job.
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:21.020]   He's gaining Google search.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:28.380]   Well, he's got a very good PR team advising him on things to say and things not to say.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.980]   I mean, he's also, he used to be a journalist.
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:34.900]   Like that was his job before he was in politics.
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:36.380]   He was a journalist.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:39.900]   He was on top gear, the TV show as a guest at one point.
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:44.060]   He was then the mayor of London and then he became prime minister.
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:47.740]   So he's got a long history of getting away with say.
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:49.740]   That's what he's doing.
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:50.740]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:54.940]   By the way, if you ever get a chance, John Oliver does a fabulous take up on Boris Johnson.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:42:01.140]   Everything I know about Boris Johnson, in fact, about British politics comes from Oliver's
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:05.380]   show on HBO, but he does a great bid on Boris Johnson, which is worth watching.
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:06.740]   I think it's on YouTube.
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:11.180]   Here from Gizmodo are the search results after Boris Johnson gave that interview.
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:17.220]   If you search for Boris Johnson, all you get is stories about Johnson's bizarre model
[01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:19.780]   bus claim.
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:25.860]   You don't get any stories about buses and lies and ads.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:26.940]   What is it like in France?
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.780]   Do politicians routinely lie in advertisements?
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:36.220]   Patrick, you're not going to believe me, but I'm pretty sure we don't have political advertising.
[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:37.220]   At all.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:38.220]   At all.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.220]   We have dedicated spaces.
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:43.380]   How do you know who to vote for?
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:50.220]   Journalists, interviews and appearances on TV, radio, newspapers.
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:51.220]   That's insane.
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:52.220]   But we're civilized.
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:53.220]   That's the issue.
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:43:01.500]   I might be wrong.
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:07.020]   I haven't watched TV in so long.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:11.740]   I haven't been in France for a long time and I didn't watch TV even when I was here.
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:21.980]   But I'm pretty sure there are severe restrictions, if not outright bans on advertising, on political
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:25.500]   parties.
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:32.100]   The reason is that exactly that it's impossible to control.
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:37.860]   You must have social media ads.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.660]   It's the same.
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:44.300]   If you have a party, we don't have packs and stuff like that.
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:49.660]   The party has to do its own action.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:55.340]   If ads, again, maybe I'm saying the dumbest thing ever and people are going to respond
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:56.860]   to me and say, "What are you talking about?"
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:58.660]   Of course, we have ads.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:05.020]   But I don't remember any ever having seen an ad on TV for a party during an election.
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:09.820]   It's a massive part of the US election season.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:17.500]   I can remember back to 1964 and Lyndon Johnson's famous ad against Barry Goldwater with a
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:27.340]   girl pulling pedals off a daisy, turning into a nuclear missile and an explosion and saying,
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:30.700]   "Who do you trust?"
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:35.300]   I could think of ad after ad after ad that have greatly influenced campaigns.
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:40.980]   It's widely considered that that ad that Lyndon Johnson ad, the daisy ad they call it, was
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.620]   instrumental in his victory in 1964.
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:51.180]   Leo, also, I think it's really important here in America to keep in mind the historical
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:53.540]   context of this.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:45:01.460]   Facebook or Fox News or other political publications printing outrageous things, there is a long,
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:05.300]   long, long history of this in the United States right here in Boston.
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:10.020]   Samuel Adams was a radical propagandist with the printing press.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:14.980]   When you look at the history of why the Aliens edition acts were passed here in this country,
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:19.540]   it was because people had a printing press and they would print the most outrageous lies
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:20.540]   about politicians.
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:25.700]   It's kind of ironic because the First Amendment became part of the Constitution, the Bill
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:31.900]   of Rights, almost immediately afterwards, the Aliens edition act, which was the most dramatic
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:37.220]   restriction of free speech in the history of the country was passed.
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:38.220]   Correct.
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:42.500]   And historians who agree that the Aliens edition acts were a huge historical mistake.
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.980]   So I do think there are ways-
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:52.700]   Just as it shows that we pay lip service to free speech, but we have a historic trend
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.460]   of ignoring it.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:57.580]   We've wrestled with this for a long time.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:02.380]   That said, I don't think it's going to hurt democracy to hold politicians like me to high
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:03.380]   standards.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:05.180]   I urge you to do this.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:07.780]   I think we should get rid of political ads.
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:08.780]   I would love that.
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.380]   There's a middle ground.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.380]   There's a middle ground.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:16.920]   I mean, we have a- There's another difference I think that between the UK, the US, and
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:23.540]   France, where in Britain, we do allow political advertising and campaigning, but there is
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:31.460]   a finite limit of the amount of money that any party or candidate can spend on promoting
[01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:32.940]   themselves.
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:33.940]   And there are-
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:34.940]   That's a good start.
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:39.060]   Yeah, so you- How much- That might be the case in France?
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:43.300]   How much does it cost to run for Congress in the US?
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:47.020]   The average amount they spend is $1.4 million every time.
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:50.620]   And how much does it cost to run for president in the US?
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:58.340]   I've seen that figure and it is mind-bogglingly large, many billions of dollars.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:03.300]   And if you think about it, nobody, even someone as rich as Donald Trump, can afford to foot
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:07.260]   the bill, you've got to get money.
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:10.700]   The very goldwater always resented this ad.
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:12.660]   He felt it was cost him the presidency.
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:18.220]   He felt it painted him as somebody who was pro-nuclear war, which he was not.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:19.820]   Let me just play this for you.
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:27.740]   Because this is historically a perfect example of really what was an attack ad that influenced
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:28.740]   the American people.
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:35.740]   It's a little girl pulling pedals off a daisy.
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:36.740]   Eight.
[01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:37.740]   Nine.
[01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:38.740]   Nine.
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:39.740]   Eight.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:40.740]   Eight.
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:41.740]   Eight.
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:42.740]   Seven.
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:43.740]   Seven.
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:44.740]   Five.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:45.740]   Four.
[01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:46.740]   Three.
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:47.740]   Two.
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:48.740]   One.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:49.740]   Zero.
[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:50.740]   One.
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:53.740]   The eyeball there is now a mushroom cloud.
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.740]   These are the stakes.
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:48:02.380]   To make a world in which all of God's children can live are to go into the dark.
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:04.380]   That is the warmonger.
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:06.740]   Must either love these people.
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:07.740]   Lyndon Johnson.
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:09.540]   Are we must die?
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:11.900]   Vote for President Johnson on November 3rd.
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:12.900]   Wow.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:13.900]   Can you believe that?
[01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:14.900]   Those are too high for you to stay home.
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:17.460]   Stakes are too high for you to stay home.
[01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:21.260]   It's a persuasive argument to say you're going to drop nuclear bombs on children.
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:24.580]   Now I got to vote for Johnson.
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:25.580]   That's a terrible idea.
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:32.460]   Of course he got a huge hole in the Vietnam.
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:35.900]   Was not exactly a man of peace.
[01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:39.940]   So maybe gold water would have been a better choice in that case.
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:47.660]   To get it back to Facebook deciding to let political ads run even with lies, how do you
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:50.500]   decide whether or not this one is a lie?
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:51.500]   I don't think you can.
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.500]   That's the problem.
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:53.500]   What is truth?
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:49:01.500]   That's why Facebook in this situation, as in many others as much as I dislike them, they
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.180]   can't win.
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:10.060]   They have created a beast as have many other companies that have created social networks
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:15.500]   where they can't control what's happening there and asking them to control it.
[01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:22.220]   I mean sure I would love for them to be able to, but tell them how, tell them what to do.
[01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:24.860]   I'm sure they will be happy to do it.
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:27.180]   But we don't know and no one knows.
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:35.580]   So out of the many difficult and not ideal solutions, I don't know that this one, because
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:41.140]   the other part of this decision is to make very clear who is running that ad.
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:43.620]   I think.
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:49.140]   If you know, then you can decide for yourself if you trust it or if it can be reported on
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:51.100]   and all of that.
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:54.940]   We're going to take a break and then all the happy stuff.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:55.940]   Yes.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:56.940]   Yes.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:57.940]   Kittens.
[01:49:57.940 --> 01:49:59.700]   Kittens and shiny new toys.
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:00.940]   I'll bring my cat in.
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:04.220]   I've saved the best for last.
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:09.500]   I have to say, I want to thank our audience if you're still listening, because these are
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:11.780]   very difficult, large, challenging issues.
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:13.540]   I think they are technology stories.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:17.660]   I think they give very much technology stories and they're very much about the future of
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:20.500]   our world and how technology is involved in it.
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:21.940]   But I know it's tough.
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:22.940]   It's daunting.
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:28.860]   And I also want to thank our panel because you guys have, you're very sensible.
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:29.860]   And I like that.
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:36.220]   Brianna Wu, Nate Langston, and of course, Patrick Bejaw.
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:38.940]   This week we had, the power was out on Wednesday and Thursday.
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:43.740]   We did some catch up, but we did miss the taping of one show.
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:48.380]   Our wonderful Aunt Pruitt, who has joined our company, Micah Sargent, Aunt Pruitt, our newest
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:49.380]   hosts.
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:51.820]   Gosh, everybody seems to be so happy about that.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:53.060]   I know I am.
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:54.780]   And thank you for their welcome.
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:56.180]   Aunt Scott, a new show.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:51:02.060]   And we thought it'd be fun to show you episode zero of Hands-On Photography coming next week.
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:03.060]   Watch.
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:04.220]   This is Twig.
[01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:18.940]   Hey, folks, I'm Aunt Pruitt and welcome to Hands-On Photography here on Twit.tv.
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:22.780]   Each and every week, we're going to take a look at how you can get the most out of your
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:27.260]   camera so you can start sharing and posting some awesome photography.
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:32.940]   I don't care if you have a smartphone or an action camera, DSLR, mirrorless, whatever
[01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:35.300]   it is, we're going to get the most out of your camera.
[01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:39.700]   We'll also get into different tips and tricks to help make your video look better.
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:45.940]   So be sure to hit that subscribe button and check us out each week here on Twit.tv.
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:51.340]   I think of Aunt as kind of the Bob Ross of Twit.
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:53.460]   He's got calm.
[01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:56.060]   He's going to show us how to make our photos look better.
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:59.540]   He's already worked on one photo of Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:00.540]   Oh my gosh.
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:03.700]   That was beautiful.
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.980]   Yeah, puffy little ear things.
[01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:11.900]   If you haven't seen this image and I have to give credit to Ziv Zoolander who did the
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:15.060]   Photoshop for this in our Twit form and Twit.
[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:16.060]   That community.
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:20.820]   I didn't get his permission to show it, but I have to say it is the best Photoshop ever
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:25.740]   of Aunt in these puffy little Bob Ross hair.
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:30.300]   We were mentioning on Twig on Friday that Stacey looked a lot like Princess Leia.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:32.220]   I think this really works.
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:38.140]   Just say it works Bob Ross and Princess Leia.
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:39.140]   Thank you, Ziv.
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:40.140]   What a good job.
[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:43.460]   I showed you, and by the way, if you're not in the Twit community, you've got to join
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:44.620]   us as our new forum.
[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:46.300]   It is just great fun.
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:47.860]   It's going gangbusters.
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:52.380]   I'm already going to have to pay extra for bandwidth because it's taken off.
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:57.860]   It's easy to get to www.twit.community if you want to join it's free.
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:52:59.140]   And it's just a lot of fun.
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:01.220]   It's a great way to talk back if you're not watching live.
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:02.220]   You're not in the chat room.
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:04.220]   It's another way you can participate with Twit.
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.300]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:08.340]   We love Zip Recruiter.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:10.980]   They have been such a boon for us.
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:11.980]   Hiring is hard.
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:12.980]   Nobody denies that.
[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:15.220]   And yet it's the most important thing you do in a company.
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:18.380]   If you're the person who does the hiring, you're building the company.
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:22.980]   The people you hire are the bricks that make that company.
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:26.420]   Great people can take a team and launch it to the moon.
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:29.340]   A bad person can bring it all down.
[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:31.540]   And that's why you've got to hire the right person.
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:36.220]   And you've got to do it fast because you're down a person, right?
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.220]   And often.
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:40.340]   Zip Recruiter does a couple of things that I think are transformative.
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:45.380]   First of all, assuming you've got an opening, assume I think you have to, that there is
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:48.620]   a perfect person out there, maybe more than one, to fill that job.
[01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:49.620]   But how do you reach them?
[01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:50.620]   There's so many job boards.
[01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:52.980]   There's so many places they could be looking.
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:58.300]   Well, you post on Zip Recruiter and immediately your post goes to 100 plus job sites, plus
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:00.100]   Facebook plus Twitter.
[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:02.540]   So it's getting to the largest patch.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:05.580]   It's getting the largest possible distribution.
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:06.780]   That's going to help.
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:07.780]   That's going to help.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:11.460]   That means the chances of that great candidate seeing your posting is even better.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:12.660]   But then Zip Recruiter does more.
[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:15.820]   It doesn't depend on candidates finding you.
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:18.860]   It finds them for you.
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:23.580]   And Zip Recruiter has an amazing technology that identifies people with the right experience,
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:25.860]   invites them to apply to your job.
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:27.940]   That means you get qualified candidates fast.
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:33.460]   Maybe you saw the TV ad with Cafe Altura's COO Dylan Miskovitz.
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.300]   He had to hire a director of coffee.
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:37.620]   Man, I wish I'd known about this opening.
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:41.860]   For his organic coffee company, believe it or not, he was having trouble finding qualified
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:44.500]   candidates, maybe because he wasn't on Zip Recruiter.
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:50.540]   Once he switched to Zip Recruiter, he got applicants fast.
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:54.700]   He said he was impressed by how quickly he had great candidate supply and he was able
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:59.220]   to hire a new director of coffee in just a few days after going to Zip Recruiter.
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:02.020]   We've had exactly the same experience.
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:04.980]   He used the candidate rating feature in Zip Recruiter to filter applicants.
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:05.980]   I love this feature.
[01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:09.980]   You can screen them with yes, no questions or multiple choice or essay questions.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:14.340]   So you don't even have to look at resumes for people who don't meet your requirements.
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:17.500]   Zip Recruiter highlights the best candidates, moves them up to the top of the list.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.980]   It all goes into the Zip Recruiter interface, by the way.
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:23.180]   So you don't get phone calls, you don't get stuff in your email.
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:24.580]   It all goes to Zip Recruiter.
[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:29.660]   They reformat the resumes to all look the same, makes it very easy to scan them.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:31.420]   This is the amazing thing.
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:34.340]   I have to say, this has been our experience.
[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:38.420]   Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate within the
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:39.420]   first day.
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:43.500]   Four out of five, we got a quality candidate within the first few hours.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:45.220]   That's how well it works.
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:50.620]   Zip Recruiter is effective for businesses of all sizes, in any industry, all over the country.
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:54.540]   A million companies have used Zip Recruiter, including Twit.
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:58.260]   You should try it free at zipprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:00.540]   zipprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:04.420]   Z-I-P-R-E-C-R-U-I-T-E-R.
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:08.900]   Zip Recruiter.com/twit.
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:15.740]   Zip Recruiter is the smartest way to thank them so much for their support of Twit.
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:19.180]   All our best words come from France, Patrick.
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:20.980]   All our worst words come from English.
[01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:24.980]   I thought you were going to say from France.
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:26.140]   No, no, no, no.
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:30.300]   All our great words in English are Anglo-Saxon.
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:36.740]   Then the French words are the more fancy, the fancy, schmancy words.
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:39.820]   I don't want to go into this because this is going to be political again.
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:44.260]   Have you seen Essentials proposed a new phone from Andy Rubin, the gem?
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:45.260]   Oh.
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:47.620]   Oh, this is a weird look at phone.
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:51.860]   Now I have to point out it's from Essentials.
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:59.780]   Andy Rubin may be a little bit tainted, but I'll show you some of his tweet.
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:01.580]   Where's the pictures in this article?
[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:03.340]   Am I doing something wrong?
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:06.300]   All the pictures are gone.
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:09.180]   Imagine you stretch a phone.
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:13.740]   It's like 21 by 6.
[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:14.740]   It's the strangest.
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:15.740]   It looks very weird.
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:17.740]   There were pictures in this article.
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:18.740]   It's original.
[01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:25.500]   I mean, it's different in a world where their old phones look the same.
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:27.180]   It's different.
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:32.220]   He also, this is by the way, there are some pictures on the first one.
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.220]   Oh, this.
[01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:39.420]   Andy Rubin, after it came out that he was fired for sexual harassment at Google and
[01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:49.180]   received a $90 million severance, stopped tweeting for a year wisely, I think.
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:54.460]   But he came back to Twitter with a vengeance last week tweeting these pictures of Essentials
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:57.100]   newest phone.
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:58:03.060]   So I think leaving the political aspect out of this and just looking at the technology,
[01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:04.620]   you have to give essential credit.
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:09.660]   They had with the last version of Android, they had an update ready on day one, which
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:14.580]   is something Samsung and other larger companies were not able to do.
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:20.940]   That said, I think if you look at the track record, the essential phone, it was not successful.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:26.100]   And I do want there to be more competition in the Android space here.
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:31.580]   I think that's why I was so excited by Microsoft's service event a few weeks ago.
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:35.140]   The duo and the Neo aren't those cool?
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:39.140]   Well, Microsoft gang involved with the Android ecosystem.
[01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:42.140]   I think they're doing amazing hardware.
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:46.740]   And I'm just not to diss whatever essential is working on here.
[01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:51.540]   I just think I think they have the infrastructure of a company to make that happen.
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:52.540]   Yeah.
[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:56.900]   I bought the PH1 their first phone and I actually liked it a lot.
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:59:02.140]   There was one big flaw, it had a bad camera and they took them a while to fix it.
[01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:03.260]   But yeah, I agree with you.
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:04.900]   I think it's an interesting company.
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:08.700]   I don't think I'll buy the gem.
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:10.500]   It's so hard, isn't it?
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:15.700]   Because you want these companies to do things to think outside the box and do something a
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:17.980]   little bit different.
[01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:23.900]   And the reality is most of the time when they do, you don't really want the product
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:25.060]   that comes out of it.
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:30.620]   So I just give us our slabs of glass, please.
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:33.020]   I just want slabs of black glass.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:37.100]   Hey, you know, actually Patrick, if I could just say one thing adding on to that though,
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:41.220]   I think that's what makes Microsoft truly interesting here.
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:43.020]   What does Microsoft do really well?
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:46.180]   Their liquid data strategy is really, really paying off.
[01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:50.580]   It's a compelling vision for the company, especially with Azure and other technologies
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:51.580]   that they have.
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:58.420]   So I think what smartphones have lacked to really differentiate them is tighter integration
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:00.900]   with the hardware and software.
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:05.460]   So when you have an idea like the duo, which is an Android phone that Microsoft is putting
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:12.740]   out, I trust Microsoft to go through, work with developers, get the integration the buy-in
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:16.580]   across the ecosystem to really make that concept shine.
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:21.740]   I don't think that that's something Samsung and certainly not essential can do.
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:27.700]   So I think you're really finding the limit of how much a single company without buy-in
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:31.500]   from developers can really affect the entire experience.
[02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:35.180]   I have to say, Andy, he has an interesting track record.
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:37.500]   Do you remember the danger hip-top?
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:38.500]   No.
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:39.500]   I do.
[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:40.580]   The sidekick.
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:41.580]   What is this?
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:43.740]   It was, I think it was, I had it.
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:44.740]   It was amazing.
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:46.500]   It was a T-Mobile phone.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:47.620]   It looked like a phone.
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:48.980]   This was many moons ago.
[02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:50.860]   It was well before the iPhone.
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:53.020]   The screen had this weird hinge.
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:56.260]   It would rotate up and then there was a keyboard.
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:58.460]   It was a really cool phone.
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:00:59.460]   Let me see if I can.
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:04.940]   Wasn't that the company that ended up developing the Palm Pre?
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:05.940]   It might have been.
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:06.940]   Here's a...
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:07.940]   Or was it no?
[02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:09.940]   It was one of the Microsoft phones.
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:10.940]   Oh my God.
[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:11.940]   I don't know how to name it.
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:15.140]   And so this screen, I'm showing a picture of it from Wikipedia.
[02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:18.180]   But if you, this screen doesn't just slide down.
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:19.540]   It rotates that.
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:21.980]   It's the weirdest hinge.
[02:01:21.980 --> 02:01:23.940]   But it was great.
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:25.780]   It didn't succeed.
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:27.660]   Just to your point, Patrick.
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:29.060]   It was a flop.
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:34.940]   No, the thing, I mean, Rubin has a pedigree for sure in tech and he created Android.
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:35.940]   Let's face it.
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:36.940]   Exactly.
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:37.940]   Yeah.
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:38.940]   He's also got a pedigree and other things.
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:39.940]   He's also got a pedigree and other things.
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:40.940]   Yeah.
[02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:44.940]   Well, we could talk about that, but I don't know how we don't need to.
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:45.940]   It's just saying.
[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:46.940]   Yeah.
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:48.700]   I mean, the duo is...
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:51.260]   Oh, you're cutting out.
[02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:52.260]   You're cutting out?
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:53.860]   Well, it was in him.
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:56.540]   If reversed and if Microsoft had shown the...
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:58.140]   Oh, sorry.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:01:59.140]   Say it all again.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:02.220]   It was reversed and Microsoft had shown the...
[02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:06.420]   If it was reversed and Microsoft had shown the gem, I think it would have been a different
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:07.420]   story.
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:13.820]   And if essential has shown the duo, then we might have been excited about and the Rubin's
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:14.820]   products again.
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:21.420]   Although, as Brianna said, they probably don't have the shoulders to make this into a successful
[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:23.180]   wide-reaching product.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:27.020]   Microsoft has more a chance there.
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:28.020]   Yeah.
[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:30.220]   I mean, look at what they're doing with the ARM.
[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:36.860]   Basically, the Surface Pro X, they're putting out ahead of time, a year ahead of schedule,
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:39.060]   to get buy-in from developers to basically...
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:40.780]   That was a little strange.
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:43.500]   I thought it was a great idea, personally.
[02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:44.500]   Maybe disagree.
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:45.500]   Sorry.
[02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:46.500]   It's...
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:47.500]   It's not like they're...
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:48.500]   It's not like they're...
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:49.500]   They're...
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:50.500]   They're...
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:51.500]   Osborneing a product.
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:52.500]   They didn't...
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:55.260]   There's no product that people would say, "Oh, well, I'm gonna wait for the duo."
[02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:57.900]   So I guess it's okay to pre-announce it.
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:58.900]   I just...
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:02:59.900]   I'm saying that...
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:01.980]   You know, it's all about the buy-in from the developers.
[02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:05.180]   So I think this is why Apple Arcade has been so successful.
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:09.420]   This is the first time you're seeing games come to iPhone that can take advantage of
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:16.020]   Apple hardware that are not compromised from a game design perspective by in-app purchases.
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:17.020]   It's fantastic.
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:21.340]   And Apple has really brought their muscle to market with getting top-tier developers
[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:23.020]   to put things out there.
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:28.420]   We're just many years past the point where hardware alone can make a compelling experience.
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:29.420]   Actually Google did...
[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:33.740]   Immediately after Apple did Arcade, Google did kind of the same thing with the PlayPass,
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:38.580]   Buck99 for the first whatever months, and then I guess it's gonna be five bucks a month.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:42.660]   And it has a similar number, not just of games, but other applications that Google
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:46.740]   says, "No in-app purchases, no ads."
[02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:47.740]   This is a trend.
[02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:48.740]   I love it.
[02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:49.740]   It's a good trend.
[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:50.740]   I immediately signed up for both.
[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:51.740]   Yep.
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:54.380]   Yeah, I love Apple Arcade so far.
[02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:55.980]   What's your favorite game name?
[02:03:55.980 --> 02:03:57.540]   It's amazing.
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:03:59.860]   I just started playing through Ocean Horn 2.
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:01.580]   That was a good game when it came out.
[02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:02.900]   I love Ocean Horn 1.
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:07.620]   Yeah, I think one of my favorite ones is this one called Tint, which is just...
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:11.140]   It's one of the reasons I love Apple Arcade is because I would never have downloaded a
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:13.460]   game like that, even if it was free.
[02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:18.820]   It's this weird, very relaxing puzzle game where you just have to blend paint colors.
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:20.260]   It's a drying game.
[02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:21.260]   Yeah.
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:22.260]   Yeah.
[02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:23.260]   I'm not an artist.
[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:27.100]   I'm a terrible artist, and I just never would have gone for a game like that.
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:28.100]   But it's so...
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:29.100]   It's very soothing.
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:30.860]   Yeah, it's soothing.
[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:35.860]   The other week, my wife was sitting next to me, and she was helping me and looking at
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:38.460]   it, and we were playing through it a little bit together.
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:39.740]   I just like, "This is great.
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:40.940]   I never would have tried this."
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:43.380]   But because it's right there, it's just...
[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:47.820]   You know, and you know there's no in-app payments as well that just makes you love the experience
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:48.820]   overall.
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:49.820]   Well...
[02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:50.820]   I did.
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:51.820]   And I think...
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:56.660]   Correct me if I'm wrong, Brianna, but it's good for indie game studios because a lot of
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:05:01.900]   times, or a lot of times, big studios just won't do simple little games like this.
[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:04.580]   They're focused on AAA blockbusters.
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:11.660]   So it's nice to see it somewhere for little games that are just nice, that are not blockbusters
[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:12.660]   have a place to be.
[02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:13.660]   Is that...
[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:14.660]   You think that's true?
[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:15.660]   Yeah.
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:21.340]   It's certainly how PlayStation Plus has gotten into the market when PlayStation Plus first
[02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:23.220]   started if you're not a gamer.
[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:26.980]   This was a service where you paid X number of dollars a month.
[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:34.380]   You had access to a competitive marketplace very similar to Xbox Live.
[02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:39.220]   And it was really great because developers could get games that were good that maybe
[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:40.940]   weren't profitable for them.
[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:46.140]   And then Sony would buy them with an outright fee and then bring them onto the service.
[02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:50.940]   It ended up being very profitable for developers that participated in that.
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:55.060]   Now we're seeing this on Apple, and don't get me wrong, they're working with WayForward,
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:58.100]   which is a very large commercial studio that does great work.
[02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:01.540]   But they're also working with smaller studios.
[02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:03.980]   And Apple is basically...
[02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:09.460]   We don't know for sure, but it seems to be from what I'm hearing from rumors that Apple
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:13.500]   is paying a significant amount of the development costs.
[02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:18.820]   And depending on the time people play it for, that is how they end up getting paid.
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:25.740]   So it's introducing a financial way forward to develop games that isn't in-app purchases.
[02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:31.020]   Are you any arcade game interesting you these days, Brianna, is that something you like?
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:33.340]   Oh God, yeah, I can name a hundred of them.
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:37.260]   The new Shontae game is amazing with WayForward.
[02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:38.260]   Disassembled.
[02:06:38.260 --> 02:06:41.980]   This is a really interesting story based game where you disassemble things.
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:47.140]   I keep looking at that to download it and thinking, "I don't want a disassembled game."
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:48.140]   It's so much fun.
[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:53.020]   I mean, the story is a little maudlin, but it's a very relaxing experience.
[02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:54.020]   Okay.
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:55.780]   And you can play it beginning to end in under an hour.
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:58.660]   I like what the golf, because it's so silly.
[02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:00.660]   It's a backwards putt golf game.
[02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:03.700]   Are you playing any Patrick on arcade?
[02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:06.860]   I was going to suggest what the golf is.
[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:08.740]   It's pretty amazing.
[02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:14.900]   But you know, Apple Arcade has done something incredible by changing the business model,
[02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:16.860]   as Brianna said again.
[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:20.300]   It's changed the game design of those games.
[02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:26.660]   And the amazing thing is that core gamers, console and PC gamers, had given up on mobile
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:27.660]   games.
[02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:29.820]   Essentially it was not something for them.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:33.900]   However good they were.
[02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:39.420]   And I don't think I've heard a single core gamer of my friends or people I listen to
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:43.340]   in respect say that they don't love Apple Arcade.
[02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:44.340]   Everyone loves it.
[02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:45.340]   It's incredible.
[02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:46.340]   I'm so glad to hear that.
[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:47.340]   I wasn't sure.
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:50.300]   You know, I was also a little worried about paid games.
[02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:54.740]   Like that the studios would say, "Well, I guess there's no market for games anymore
[02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:58.620]   on the Apple platform."
[02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:00.220]   And Gloria is doing very well.
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:01.220]   That's competitive.
[02:08:01.220 --> 02:08:02.220]   MOBBA.
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:03.460]   I play that all the time.
[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:07.180]   But yeah, I do think there's going to be a consequence that I think you're going to
[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:12.660]   have people that pay their X number of dollars a month and they're going to opt out of buying
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:14.460]   games traditionally.
[02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:16.620]   And that's going to have a consequence.
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:24.660]   Personally, I think the game industry will be fine if we have a few less IAP-heavy fun
[02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:29.180]   game games coming to market where you pay to win.
[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:32.860]   Yeah, I wouldn't mind if freemium went away for good.
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:36.020]   I spent way too much money on Simpson's Donuts.
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:37.020]   MOBBA.
[02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:38.020]   It's too expensive.
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:39.020]   I remember that, Leo.
[02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:43.740]   I remember how angry you got when did they break your account?
[02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:50.740]   They broke my account and I had hundreds of donuts in hundreds of dollars in donuts.
[02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:54.100]   I think I had $300 of donuts I bought.
[02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:59.380]   I had a story in Mac life where I used to be a columnist for them about the people that
[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:04.500]   spent 30, 40, 50, $100,000 on the Final Fantasy 15.
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:05.660]   Oh, I feel better.
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:07.980]   Which is a wildly addictive game.
[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:08.980]   Yeah, so.
[02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:09.980]   So much better.
[02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:10.980]   300 bucks, nothing.
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:11.980]   Oh, no.
[02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:12.980]   Nothing.
[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:13.980]   Nothing.
[02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:16.420]   You actually saved money, Leo.
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:18.420]   It could have been worse.
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:20.220]   It could have been worse.
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:24.020]   Two research center does regular polls of Americans.
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:29.980]   If you thought Congress was dumb about tech, well, you hear some of these results.
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:38.540]   Only 28% of American adults can identify an example of two-factor authentication.
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:43.340]   Even though, of course, they use it all the time with their ATM card and their PIN.
[02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:47.500]   One quarter of Americans, only one quarter of Americans know that private browsing only
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:51.820]   hides the browser history from other users of that computer.
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:58.460]   And about half say, we don't even know what private browsing does.
[02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:02.580]   Only 20% of adults answered seven or more questions correctly.
[02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:06.780]   Only 2% got all 10 questions correct.
[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:08.540]   I am not going to challenge you.
[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:12.500]   I know you guys are smart and I would sure that everybody listening to the show would
[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:15.820]   get all 10 correct.
[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:19.100]   So I won't challenge you.
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:25.020]   Although I have to say one of the questions was, can you correctly identify a picture of
[02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:26.020]   Jack Dorsey?
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:27.020]   Oh, God.
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:28.020]   Yeah.
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:29.660]   That's a lame question.
[02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:30.660]   I'm sorry.
[02:10:30.660 --> 02:10:31.660]   lame is not a good word anymore.
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:33.460]   That's a stupid stupid.
[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:34.460]   Okay.
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:36.460]   That's a dumb question.
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.700]   Seven percent got it wrong.
[02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:40.020]   Fifteen percent got it right.
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:42.940]   Seventy seven percent said, Jack who?
[02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:44.900]   Okay.
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.700]   Let me ask you this, then Leo.
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:47.700]   Yes.
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:49.380]   Isn't this our fault?
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:52.940]   Aren't we the people who should be making this understandable?
[02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:54.140]   But I have said a hunt.
[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:57.100]   I talk about two factor every freaking day.
[02:10:57.100 --> 02:11:00.740]   I tell people all the time private browsing is not private.
[02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:02.500]   It's not my fault.
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:03.500]   You're fine.
[02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:05.420]   Yeah, maybe it is.
[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:08.700]   But we're not talking to real people.
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:09.700]   I know.
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:12.180]   We're talking to people who are already interested in these things.
[02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:18.700]   Maybe it should be tech journalists' job to present this in a way that is more understandable
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:20.500]   by regular people.
[02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:21.500]   It's important.
[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:22.500]   Okay.
[02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:23.500]   But I'm not taking responsibility.
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:24.500]   So you go do that.
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:25.500]   I don't have to.
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:26.500]   Yeah.
[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:27.500]   You're friends.
[02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:28.500]   You don't have to.
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:30.940]   One of the things I heard this when I was in journalism school and I loved it and I try
[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:34.700]   to remember it is the theory of the interlocking public.
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:39.780]   I come from Mississippi and there's a kind of undercurrent that people from the deep
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:42.100]   south are dumb, which is not true.
[02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:44.740]   They're just different things that they're interested in.
[02:11:44.740 --> 02:11:50.100]   I think if we took an average person from Mississippi and brought them to Massachusetts,
[02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:56.460]   they would know a lot more about how to get a skin and deer or fix their car.
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:59.860]   So I try to remember like my husband has a PhD.
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:02.260]   He cannot update his iPhone software.
[02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:03.900]   He just doesn't care.
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:05.860]   It's just not something he's interested.
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:06.860]   It's not important.
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:13.740]   I do think this is where it's really easy to make fun of stuff like this.
[02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:16.980]   I think I try to see it more as service.
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:21.540]   Those of us that do understand this stuff, we have a responsibility in our families to
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:22.540]   help them be safe.
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:29.060]   I certainly think government has a role in making sure people are safe online in the
[02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:31.140]   same way they are physically safe.
[02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:33.620]   So I think it's a function.
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:36.820]   I don't know everything about the financial regulation more.
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:38.340]   I don't know what we would be there.
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.340]   Let's be clear.
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:41.500]   It's not an assertion that people are dumb if they don't know this.
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:42.660]   That's obviously not true.
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:43.660]   Frank's not dumb.
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:49.180]   But a certain amount of digital literacy would probably be a good thing.
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:56.380]   If we could do one thing for security to get everybody used to factor, I just wrote a
[02:12:56.380 --> 02:13:01.380]   piece for the AARP magazine on two factor, what it is, how to use it, and why you should
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:02.580]   turn it on.
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:05.940]   So it's not my fault.
[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:08.660]   It's the American Association of Retired People.
[02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:10.500]   It's a bunch of old farts.
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:16.020]   And the editor said, "Our readers identify with you, Leo."
[02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:21.380]   And I said, "Okay, I'll write you a little article there."
[02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:24.740]   By the way, next time I need a skin idea, I'm calling you Brianna Wu.
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:26.060]   I can't help you.
[02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:27.060]   I'm sorry.
[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:29.180]   But you're forgetting a sippy.
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:31.460]   I could tell you a lot about how to fix a car.
[02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:32.460]   Oh, that's true.
[02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:33.460]   I don't know anything about the car.
[02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:34.460]   Or how to reboot a boxer.
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:35.460]   Yeah.
[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:36.460]   I'll do that.
[02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:41.140]   Hey, we have three people in the studio today from London, from the UK, John, Steve, and
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:42.140]   Robin.
[02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:43.860]   They are accessibility experts.
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:46.820]   They work with NGOs on improving accessibility.
[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:48.780]   Is that a correct characterization?
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:49.780]   They're going up to Microsoft.
[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:50.780]   They're going to Google.
[02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:52.220]   They're going around visiting.
[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:58.100]   They must be very happy about the most recent Supreme Court decision, which says blind people
[02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:02.300]   can sue retailers if their websites are not accessible.
[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:09.220]   The Supreme Court, by declining to overturn a lower court ruling, says that the American
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:14.380]   for Disabilities Act does apply to digital properties.
[02:14:14.380 --> 02:14:18.340]   Just as much as you have to make your Domino's Pizza accessible, you have to make your Domino's
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:20.540]   Pizza website accessible.
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:27.420]   It all from a lawsuit that was filed by Guillermo Robles three years ago in Los Angeles.
[02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:32.740]   He couldn't order a pizza online because the Domino's website was not accessible.
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:37.980]   He cited the ADA, which guarantees people with a disability full and equal enjoyment
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:42.340]   of the goods and services of any place of public accommodations.
[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:46.580]   Domino says, "Well, that applies to our brick and mortar locations, not to our website.
[02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:53.220]   The Ninth Circuit ruled for Robles and the Supreme Court declined to overturn."
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:56.940]   So that is, I think, a good thing, something we're going to have to think about.
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:14:58.500]   We've got to work on our accessibility.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:03.060]   It's what we do what we can, but I think we could do better.
[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:09.100]   I think if you think about the spirit of net neutrality, it's making sure people, regardless
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:13.260]   of income level and background, have access to the same information.
[02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:20.460]   I think if you're for net neutrality, I think it's very hard to be against this ruling.
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:25.580]   It is costly in some cases to develop total accessibility.
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:28.060]   The game industry is a really good example.
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:33.220]   We've repeatedly asked for accessibility extensions because it's very difficult to account for
[02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:35.260]   all those use cases there.
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:42.100]   But I think, generally speaking, making a computer able to read menu information for someone
[02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:46.380]   who is visually impaired, I think that's a very low bar, and I was very happy to see
[02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:47.380]   this ruling.
[02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:53.700]   We should point out Microsoft has done some really good work, at least with their advertising
[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:54.700]   on accessibility.
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:16:01.220]   They have an accessible Xbox controller designed for people with difficulty using a regular
[02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:02.220]   controller.
[02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:04.980]   I think companies are doing good work.
[02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:08.540]   Roland in our chat room points out the cost of Domino's website.
[02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:11.380]   Upgrade was going to be less than $40,000.
[02:16:11.380 --> 02:16:18.180]   They spent far more in lawyers' fees taking it all away in the Supreme Court and lost.
[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:20.780]   So maybe that's not such a bad thing.
[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:29.020]   Finally, good news, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to three scientists for creating lithium
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:31.500]   ion batteries.
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:36.140]   John Goodnow of the University of Texas at Austin, M. Stanley, Whittingham of Binghamton
[02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:44.620]   University, and Akira Yoshino of Meijo University will share the Nobel Prize and the $9 million
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:45.620]   Swedish croner.
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:48.580]   This was announced on Wednesday.
[02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:50.780]   Goodnow is 97 years old.
[02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:57.460]   He's the oldest laureate to receive a Nobel Prize in any discipline.
[02:16:57.460 --> 02:17:03.340]   So he gets, I guess, pride of place is the first to think of the idea of using lithium
[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:04.820]   ion for batteries.
[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:15.780]   Obviously, the most important battery invention of our times without no cell phones, no laptops,
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:18.740]   no air pods.
[02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:21.300]   And none of that, whatever that is.
[02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:26.820]   Hey, we got to wrap this up, but it's such a pleasure to have you.
[02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:32.180]   I wish we had another four hours to talk because you are a great panel.
[02:17:32.180 --> 02:17:33.420]   I really appreciate it.
[02:17:33.420 --> 02:17:35.780]   Nate Langson, he writes for Bloomberg.
[02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:37.860]   He's their European tech editor.
[02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:41.780]   He's also a Taylor Swift fan.
[02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:47.780]   And widely known as a Taylor Swift fan, UKtechshow.com, anything you want to plug?
[02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:50.860]   Oh, he's frozen solid.
[02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:57.660]   I thought he was just grumpy because I apparently have lost it.
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:02.980]   Port, portnade is frozen in the middle of a frown, which really I feel bad for.
[02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:09.780]   UKtechshow.com text message, the UK focus technology podcast.
[02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:14.780]   Oh, he died.
[02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:18.860]   He made it almost all the way to the end.
[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:20.420]   Yeah, text message, everybody.
[02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:22.580]   I like that name text message, by the way.
[02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:25.580]   That's T-E-C-H apostrophe, yes.
[02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:30.020]   Patrick Bejai is known, well known for his English and French language podcasts.
[02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:32.420]   The English ones are at Frenchspin.com.
[02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:35.420]   He does Le Chonde vous dec.
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:38.380]   So if you're a fan, great to have you.
[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:41.380]   Anything you want to plug, not Patrick?
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:47.060]   Sure, we talked a lot about politics, China and a few other things.
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:51.380]   I'd recommend you check out the Phyllis Club, which is on Frenchspin.com.
[02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:57.700]   It's a show where we talk to people from different parts of the world and different
[02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:58.700]   opinions.
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:04.700]   And we had a couple of specials, which might interest you, one about China in Africa, where
[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:11.340]   we had someone who's a specialist on China and someone from Ethiopia, actually, Lina,
[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:14.380]   who told us about what they think about the Chinese.
[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:18.740]   And it's very different from what we think about the Chinese.
[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:24.300]   And another one just recently, we did the first one of the Brexit saga, where I had an
[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:31.140]   Irishman, a Scott, and an Englishman, one of them being a pro-Brexit person.
[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:36.500]   And believe it or not, we had a thoughtful, considerate, calm conversation, as we always
[02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:38.780]   do on this show.
[02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:40.260]   And it was very informative.
[02:19:40.260 --> 02:19:41.260]   So check that out.
[02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:42.260]   It's at Frenchspin.com.
[02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:43.540]   I'll have to listen to that.
[02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:47.540]   And then on pixels, you talk about the goose game.
[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:48.540]   Yes.
[02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:49.540]   You love that game.
[02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:50.540]   I love that game.
[02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:51.540]   What is the appeal of it?
[02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:52.540]   I don't understand.
[02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:54.340]   Because you're a jerk store.
[02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:58.700]   You're a goose and you're a complete jerk.
[02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:02.380]   And you're honking with just human search on your stuff.
[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:05.060]   It's fun being a jerk.
[02:20:05.060 --> 02:20:12.700]   That game has shown the world how incredibly entertaining it is to be a goose and to wumble
[02:20:12.700 --> 02:20:15.740]   around like a goose and honk at people.
[02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:17.180]   It's hours of fun.
[02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:18.180]   It's crazy.
[02:20:18.180 --> 02:20:23.620]   It's all about the goose liberation front and understanding what the goose goes through
[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:26.060]   and not eating foie gras anymore.
[02:20:26.060 --> 02:20:31.060]   You're joking, but it's kind of metal gear solid, but with a goose.
[02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:32.060]   Okay.
[02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:33.060]   Wow.
[02:20:33.060 --> 02:20:40.580]   It's being a jerk has never been as fun as when you're a goose.
[02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:41.580]   It's a goose.
[02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:42.580]   It's a good speed.
[02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:48.740]   So the only problem I have is I had to install the Epic installer to run the damn thing.
[02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:51.700]   And I took it off because it kept popping up ads for other Epic games.
[02:20:51.700 --> 02:20:54.100]   It made me so angry.
[02:20:54.100 --> 02:20:58.700]   I hate it when they wrap these things around the door.
[02:20:58.700 --> 02:21:00.500]   Yeah, it's a store.
[02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:01.500]   You have a switch.
[02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:02.500]   It's great on switch.
[02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:05.220]   Yeah, maybe I'll put it on the switch instead because on Windows.
[02:21:05.220 --> 02:21:06.220]   You buy it again.
[02:21:06.220 --> 02:21:07.220]   Nice.
[02:21:07.220 --> 02:21:08.220]   Five twice.
[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:09.220]   It's only $20.
[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:11.860]   Well, it's 14 on switch.
[02:21:11.860 --> 02:21:16.060]   Oh, Brianna, what a pleasure.
[02:21:16.060 --> 02:21:19.900]   Everybody should run and give money to Brianna.
[02:21:19.900 --> 02:21:25.060]   We need people like Brianna and Congress desperately.
[02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:26.660]   When is the primary?
[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:28.660]   It is September of next year.
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:36.580]   So I do, but Leon, that's been the next six months outside in 40, 30 degree weather, knocking
[02:21:36.580 --> 02:21:39.260]   on doors, meeting people.
[02:21:39.260 --> 02:21:44.340]   We've had 19,000 new registered voters in Massachusetts District 8 in just the last
[02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:46.220]   11 months, which is good.
[02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:49.020]   But now I have to go knock on their door and meet them.
[02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:54.500]   So one of the reasons every time you ask me, I come on, my team says yes, because Twitter
[02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:57.740]   listeners are so generous in supporting me.
[02:21:57.740 --> 02:21:59.380]   So I just want to say thank you.
[02:21:59.380 --> 02:22:03.220]   If you want to be part of that, you can go to supportbrianna.com.
[02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:04.580]   Supportbrianna.com.
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:10.500]   B-R-I-A-N-N-A.com supportbrianna.com.
[02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:15.540]   And if you're in the Massachusetts 8th, you know what you need to do in September.
[02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:16.540]   The job is clear.
[02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:18.540]   Thank you so much.
[02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:19.540]   So back to the calls.
[02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:20.820]   You've got some money to raise.
[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:21.820]   I do, I do.
[02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:23.980]   Actually, the Yankees are about to play.
[02:22:23.980 --> 02:22:24.980]   Oh, no, forget it.
[02:22:24.980 --> 02:22:27.580]   You're not calling anybody during the Yankees game.
[02:22:27.580 --> 02:22:30.420]   So my husband, I am a Red Sox fan.
[02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:32.180]   I'm a Boston politician.
[02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:33.340]   Of course I am.
[02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:35.780]   By married to the world's biggest Yankees fan.
[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:36.780]   Oh, that's not.
[02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:38.980]   He's a tea party equivalent to the Yankees fan.
[02:22:38.980 --> 02:22:40.420]   That's not good at all.
[02:22:40.420 --> 02:22:41.420]   Yes.
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:42.420]   So this is my duty.
[02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:43.420]   It's his wife.
[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:46.660]   All the rots said, I don't care what happens this weekend, but the Yankees better lose.
[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:47.660]   I like you.
[02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:49.620]   That's a good guy.
[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:52.060]   He's a Red Sox fan also from denim.
[02:22:52.060 --> 02:22:53.060]   There we go.
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:57.180]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 230 Pacific as long as the power is on.
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:58.180]   Thank goodness.
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:03.220]   230 Pacific 530 Eastern time, 2130 UTC.
[02:23:03.220 --> 02:23:04.420]   You can watch it live.
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:05.860]   Twitter TV slash live.
[02:23:05.860 --> 02:23:07.780]   There's audio and video streams there.
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:12.660]   You can also chat while you're watching an IRC dot twit.tv.
[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:14.340]   But honestly, it's a podcast.
[02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:17.260]   So you can listen whenever you darn well feel like it.
[02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:19.860]   The key is getting a copy of the show.
[02:23:19.860 --> 02:23:24.300]   It's available as are all our shows at our website, twit.tv.
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:28.460]   But you would do us a solid and yourself a solid if you would subscribe in your favorite
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:29.460]   podcast application.
[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:31.940]   That way you don't have to think about it.
[02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:37.140]   It just appears on your phone as soon as it's been edited and produced.
[02:23:37.140 --> 02:23:41.940]   As soon as it comes off the factory floor, almost always just in time for your Monday
[02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:43.740]   morning commute.
[02:23:43.740 --> 02:23:47.100]   And if you are a podcast listener and you say, well, I can't be in the chatroom.
[02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:52.980]   Don't forget we now have forums for all of our asynchronous listeners and viewers.
[02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:55.340]   And those are at www.twit.community.
[02:23:55.340 --> 02:24:00.220]   And it's a lot of fun in there.
[02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:02.140]   There's our Twit community.
[02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:04.060]   And many of our hosts are in there.
[02:24:04.060 --> 02:24:05.660]   They're all invited, of course.
[02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:08.660]   All our shows are represented in a lot of our great fans.
[02:24:08.660 --> 02:24:12.620]   If you want to be in the studio, we had a great studio audience today.
[02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:17.460]   Andy and Andrew, we're here from Toronto, Zach and Zach.
[02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:19.940]   We're here from Phoenix and Danville.
[02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:22.620]   And of course, John, Stephen, Robin from London.
[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:26.020]   If you want to be in studio, we'd love to have you just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:30.820]   That way, if the power's out, we can warn you before you get here and you won't waste
[02:24:30.820 --> 02:24:31.820]   your time.
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:36.860]   If you're up in Northern California, if you're in the Petaluma area any day, any Sunday,
[02:24:36.860 --> 02:24:38.700]   just come by.
[02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:39.700]   Tickets@twit.tv.
[02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:42.380]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:24:42.380 --> 02:24:47.380]   Now it's time to go home because another Twit is in the game.
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:49.380]   Bye-bye.
[02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:56.380]   [MUSIC]
