[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   right, Kevin.

[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Google.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Great to see you, Kevin.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Nice to see you too.

[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Let's not forget Salesforce.com.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   That's a very major.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   They're in the city run the valley.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Close.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It's the same thing.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Software.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Also with us, Tim Stevens, editor in chief for the Tech news.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   With this, Tim Stevens, editor in chief, former editor in chief at Engadget.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   He's now doing CAR Tech at CNET and very timely to have you on Welcome Tim because the LA
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   CAR show was this week.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I want to welcome somebody who hasn't been on our air since we've decided 2008.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.120]   He's an old friend and I think one of the great guys in the valley, Sam Lesson, you may
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.000]   remember him from drop.io which was just my favorite thing.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It allowed you to share files online, just create these ad hoc file sharing sites.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Facebook came along, bought it, put it out of business, put Sam to work.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   You did the timeline, right, when you were at Facebook?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I built timeline with a great team.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And now you're, did you retire from Facebook?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Did you cash in the stock and say that's it?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I'm done.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I'm a huge believer in Facebook.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'm very excited about the company.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.360]   I love the people that work there but I decided at the end of August it was time for me to
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.560]   move on.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.000]   So I left and I am now the intern at the information.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Now, now.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.640]   With some having a blast doing.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.680]   Before you say, "Oh Sam, you've come down in the world.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.520]   We should point out that the information is Jessica Lesson, his wife's really great publication,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.200]   kind of a new form of tech journalism aimed at people in the know.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.240]   It's a subscription only online site and newsletter.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.000]   And we've had Jessica on several times and it's really great.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.240]   We think the world of both of you.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.720]   Oh, thank you.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.040]   I think the world of first you.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.120]   Is this something you've always wanted to do is be a journal?
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.200]   Because I know you're writing a weekly column now.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.040]   Yeah, I'm writing a weekly column.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.520]   And I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore journalist the way the rest of the team at
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.880]   the information is about hardcore journalists.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.720]   I'm more writing a kind of an opinion column.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.600]   I'm having a lot of fun and figuring out the next steps.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.920]   But I think what they're doing is awesome.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.840]   And so beyond being a supportive husband, I'm having a lot of fun working with the team
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.600]   and putting out some content and helping where I can.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   I think that's great.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.200]   I have to say, speaking as somebody who never worked in the business, I know that Kevin
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.240]   has of course and you have both kind of entrepreneurial software guys and so forth.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.920]   The nice thing about covering it is you don't have to pick sides.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.200]   You can cover it though.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   You see everything.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   You have ringside seats at all the stuff that's happening.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.520]   And it's so much fun.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.840]   Yeah, it's a blast.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.840]   I mean, I think I'm loving kind of the perspective.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   I think also honestly, having spent four years at Facebook and being a VP of product there.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   It's just a different perspective that really changes how you approach a lot of these things
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.680]   just because you have so much more context for what a lot of these big companies are
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.960]   going through and how they evaluate decisions.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.440]   So I don't know.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   Life is good.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.360]   It's great to get an entrepreneur on this side because you know more than a lot on exactly
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.520]   what's going on inside.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:49.000]   So I'm glad you're here because of course our top story unfortunately has to be Uber.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.200]   But I think it's a, I don't want to cover the, we will cover a little bit the kind of
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   what happened.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   He said she said thing.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:02.280]   But more importantly, I think maybe a culture clash between the go-go startup culture, Silicon
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.960]   Valley and the rest of the world.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.040]   And you've been in the middle of it.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   What's your take?
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.040]   And I know you've written about this at the information.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.760]   What's your take on what's going on at Uber?
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.080]   I mean, I have all the respect of the world for Uber.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.840]   I think it's one of the most exciting companies probably ever in terms of both what it represents
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.480]   for the future.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.120]   But I also think they say that this very interesting spot and kind of the poster child for this
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.320]   new generation of Silicon Valley companies that actually have a meaningful and immediate
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.400]   impact in the real world.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.440]   You know, I think the last generation of companies, actually I'm running a call to this tomorrow,
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.800]   but like the last generation of companies existed in this world where they're working
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.440]   on productivity, your communication or things where you can have great impact, but you're
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.240]   not changing the day to day in an immediate way the way a company like Uber is.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.040]   And I think that, you know, when you look at Uber, Airbnb, a lot of the things that are
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.480]   going on now, there's such a dramatic impact in the real world immediately that it really
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.920]   raises the bar of attention that's put on them and kind of the professionalism that
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.360]   needs to happen in a lot of areas.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.520]   So, you know, my kind of take is they're a company that's figuring it out.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.240]   They're fundamentally good people from my perspective and the ones I know that are there.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.160]   But yeah, I mean, there's a lot to figure out and you have to grow up quickly in this
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.680]   day and age in terms of just the amount of attention that's put on these things.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.600]   Jessica Lesin's lead story at the information is that there were in Uber saga, there are
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.480]   no calls for adult supervision.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.280]   I don't know, I'll call for adult supervision.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.080]   It seems like something odd is going on.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.080]   There is this he said, she said back and forth.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.320]   And I'm not sure exactly what actually happened.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.480]   There were, you can't, we can't know because it was at a private dinner.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.880]   Uber has been accused in the past of being kind of high handed with privacy.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:02.080]   There's the God mode, an Uber that tells Uber employees exactly where every car is
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.680]   and who's riding in those cars and that information could theoretically be gathered to pinpoint
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.280]   locations of people.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.440]   A couple of journalists have accused Uber of misusing that one, pointed out that he got
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.960]   a text from somebody who was at an Uber party said, "You're on the big map right now.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.600]   We know exactly where you are."
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.240]   Uber unwisely decided to put the God mode up on a big screen at a party.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:30.160]   Another said that Uber in an effort to put pressure on this journalist, one of an Uber
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.920]   executive was waiting for him when he arrived or heard in the car and said, "Well, I know
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.680]   exactly where you are at all times because you're riding in an Uber."
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.680]   That scares people.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.600]   There have been several cases of, there's a case of assault by an Uber driver.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.640]   Uber driver in San Francisco is accused of having killed a six-year-old running over
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.880]   in a family.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:58.240]   Ironically, after all of that, the big story really is this Uber executive, Emil Michael,
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:06.600]   who at a private dinner speaking to the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed, according to the editor-in-chief
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.280]   at BuzzFeed, said that Uber should do opposition research on journalists who are critical of
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:20.000]   Uber and attempt to dig up dirt on them, in particular, Sarah Lacey from Pando Daily.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.040]   Apparently, according to Ben Smith, the editor at BuzzFeed, he said that Emil told him that
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.520]   there's some particular information that would be very damaging to her.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:45.920]   She immediately took Umbridge and made the rounds.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:10:01.520]   Some events said nothing like that actually happened.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:17.760]   But Ben Smith of BuzzFeed may be exaggerating this.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:42.000]   I think there's a big question in this day and age, especially the relationship between
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   the two.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:18.960]   I think
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:39.120]   of
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:12:09.080]   what
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:16.080]   the
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.080]   two.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:46.040]   I think
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   that's
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:00.040]   a
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   big
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   point.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:21.040]   I think
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:28.040]   there's
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.040]   a
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   big
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:42.040]   company
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   in
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   the
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   two.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:24.040]   I think
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   that's
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:38.040]   a
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   big
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   point.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   I think
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   that's
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   a
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   big
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   point.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:27.040]   I think
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   that's
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   a big point.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   I think that's a big point.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.600]   I think it's hard not to use Uber because the truth about it is all this aside, the
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   experience is generally very good.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.440]   You rate the driver, the driver rates you.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.920]   I don't know what it's like to drive for Uber.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.640]   I'm hearing ads on the radio every day saying, "We'll give you $5,000 in your first month
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   to become an Uber driver."
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.680]   Yet, I also hear drivers saying it's terrible experience being a driver.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   I want out.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.320]   I don't know what to think.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.640]   There's so many conflicting stories.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.840]   This is an interesting...
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   I think the larger story to me, which I think is more interesting from my point of view,
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.960]   is that this is going to be the way things are going forward.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.400]   There will be many because of the internet, because of social media, because of the speed
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:34.040]   of the news cycle, because there is no longer a single source of truth.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.480]   There used to be the Journal of Record, The New York Times or CBS.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.720]   There's no longer a single source of truth.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.640]   I think more and more stories are going to be like this.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.280]   We're going to hear different things from a lot of different people.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.280]   Everybody has suspect...
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.800]   Perhaps, has suspect motivations.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.160]   Ben Smith wants to get clicks.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.960]   The whole thing, it starts to become very difficult for an end user and end consumer
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.360]   of news to know what's true and what to do.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.360]   This has always been true.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.960]   But I think it's more true now.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.040]   The news used to be objective is a myth.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.920]   I know Jeff Jarvis would take you to the task of that as well.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.280]   The thing is, there was always the agendas being pushed.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.440]   It's just the question of how many people were able to speak about them and have them as
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.440]   a form to post.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.200]   I think something is fundamentally different now.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.560]   Again, this is a little self-serving on behalf of my wife.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.200]   What's different now is the business model and how people get paid.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.880]   When you get paid for clicks, when you get paid for getting people attention through social
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.680]   media and to your site, that incentivizes a certain type of discussion and reporting
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.040]   and sensationalism that I think isn't true if you're running a subscription service or
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.240]   you're actually paid to be a trusted source of knowledge.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.920]   I think it's always a spectrum.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.320]   Things aren't black and white in the world.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.520]   But I think it's a little bit simplistic to say nothing has changed.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.400]   The business model is that people are running and therefore what types of information moves
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.840]   around is dramatically different than it was 20 years ago.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:05.000]   Well, I don't want to say that the only model is the informations model.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.720]   Certainly there's a benefit to that because the information only has to respond to its
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   subscribers.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.080]   They don't have to generate clicks.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.760]   They don't have advertisers.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.440]   But I would hope, given that we're ad supported free media, that there's a role for ad supported
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.920]   free media, which is a more traditional way of doing things.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:27.560]   I would hope that there, BuzzFeed, I'll put Vice in this category, are different ways
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   of doing journalism, but they've done some good journalism.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.800]   I just think it's very hard for the consumer to know who to trust.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:40.080]   It's very hard as a journalist to maintain that independence from an intent to trying
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.600]   to get more traffic.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.960]   Back in the day, if you're writing for a big newspaper or a big outlet, you didn't really
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   worry about how many people were reading your story.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.720]   You wanted to get on the front page for sure, but it didn't matter to you if your story
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.720]   helped to sell more newspapers because ultimately your job was secure regardless.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.600]   Now a lot of these outlets, a lot of these operations are much smaller and you really
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.600]   feel the pressure to be able to drive those clicks, to drive that traffic, to help the
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.600]   money coming in.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.680]   There's always supposed to be a separation between churches.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.840]   State we say, where you don't know what the advertising is, you don't know the advertising
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.040]   dollars and you don't worry about that sort of thing.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.400]   But ultimately, if you're at a smaller outlet or some kind of a startup journalistic publication,
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.960]   you have a pretty good feel for what is doing well and what is not doing well.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.800]   If these stories aren't doing well, then you know that the writings on the wall, things
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.320]   aren't going to last too long.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.000]   So there's that pressure for sure.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And I can-
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.280]   You were in the hot seat, you were in the chief at Engadget at AOL.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.880]   I can't imagine more of a hot seat.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.600]   Yeah, and there was certainly a lot of pressure they wanted to do, a lot of things that I
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.360]   didn't want to do within Engadget, which may be why things are the way they are right
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.960]   now, but that's okay.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.960]   So there's a lot of pressure for sure whether you are a journalist or whether you are a
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.160]   theatre in chief of a site like that or whether you're indeed someone who's running on the
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.640]   business side of things and responsible for ad revenue and everything else.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.440]   There's a lot of pressure to get the traffic up there and to make these things work.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.320]   And ultimately I think that that pressure is now more closely felt by journalists than
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.120]   probably ever in the past.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:10.840]   It worries me because I think as a consumer, there's now an undue burden on me to determine
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.160]   the truth.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.240]   There is innuendo flying right and left and it's kind of the natural thing I'm speaking
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.120]   for myself to say, well, where there's smoke, there must be fire.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.840]   So something happened here.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.720]   But maybe the right, it's not the right response to say, well, I'm giving up on Uber because
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.000]   maybe we don't really know.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.520]   I don't know.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.520]   I think it's a question.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.520]   Who do you trust?
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   Who do you trust?
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.600]   Well, Sam, why am I in a year going to use Uber again?
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.160]   Or they?
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.920]   Because it's a great service and because honestly you don't know what it went on and
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.120]   hopefully they're going to mature.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.080]   I'm sure they will look at more controls in place.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.240]   You know, these things, they're moving fast.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   And again, that's not to apologize.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.680]   I think clearly mistakes were made in just in the fact that there was a huge cycle around
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680]   this.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:04.480]   Well, but maybe what they'll get under control is the news cycle, not their own internal
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.480]   policies.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.640]   Maybe God mode won't go away.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.840]   They'll just learn how to hide it better.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.840]   That's the thing.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.360]   They have been deleting the blog posts off their side.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.640]   They were doing the data analysis, which is sketchy behavior.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:21.120]   And then those posts did have, did if open attitude and they were two years old, okay.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.880]   But you don't just say, oh, let's just delete this from the same time it didn't happen.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:33.320]   Had discussed what you've changed rather than what would you tell young people growing
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:39.440]   up today who are growing up in this world about critical thinking.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440]   What do you teach them?
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.160]   How do you teach them what to believe and what not to believe?
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.320]   Is there a rule?
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.760]   Kevin, is there a guy?
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.960]   You've got young adult children.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.760]   What do you tell them?
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.560]   Well, part of it is that they're immersed in it and they can work it out for themselves.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   Can they?
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.560]   Yes.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:04.520]   If you actually read young adult novels these days, half of them is about media narrative
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   and understanding.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.080]   If you read the Hunger Games, half of it is like fighting and the other half is how is
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.240]   this presented in the media?
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   That's true.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.880]   Harry Potter, there's the entire Rita Skeeter thread.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.520]   If you read the Ugly's trilogy, a big chunk of that is how they perceive discovering what's
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.920]   wrong with society and then how they perceive once they do it.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.800]   There is this sense of necessary and, and, and, and, Corey Doctorow has written like three
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.640]   young adult novels that have massive components of media explanations and government cover
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.480]   up and what it means to be growing up in this world.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.640]   I think that the literature is already there for them, but also it's pervasive in their
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.800]   world.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:50.680]   I'm, when I got my sons to sign up for, for known, which is a blogging website that lets
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.560]   you connect to different social networks, I was surprised how reluctant they were to
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.640]   connect it to Facebook because from their point of view, they've been burnt before by
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.240]   connecting things to Facebook and they didn't know what it would send out there.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:09.400]   And Facebook for them is, is not their, their communication mechanism so much as the public
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.200]   space that the notice board where other people can see things and they were very aware and
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.760]   they're very aware of managing what they post on Facebook as opposed to what they send
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.960]   in, in, in more covert channels.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.360]   What would you tell your kids, Tim Stevens?
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:29.680]   Well, my kids are both four legged and, they don't read about journalism too much.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.680]   I do though.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.200]   You've seen the sausage being made.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.040]   You've been right in there.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.320]   And the question that I've had all week was just how much is this story resonating with
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.160]   those of us outside of the journalism startup community?
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.160]   That's a good point.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.120]   We've been a huge story amongst us and, and then, you know, the close circles around,
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.560]   around this, but I still haven't gotten a good feel for how many people were aware of it.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.400]   In fact, I was in LA this week and I did use an Uber and to feel guilty about it, but
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   I did use an Uber.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.120]   I talked to the driver a bit and just kind of asked him how business was and he indicated
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.240]   that things were a little bit slower than usual, but he didn't know anything about any
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.480]   of this controversy at all.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.400]   And here's a guy who's, you know, livelihood is dependent on Uber and he wasn't aware of
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.520]   this story at all, which made me wonder just how many people outside of, of this, you
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.400]   know, inter journalistic and startup circle actually are aware of any of this at all.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.840]   And realistically, how much does it impact those people?
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.280]   That's probably the biggest question I've had.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.480]   You know, this is, it's almost inside our baseball, this sort of thing.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.080]   It's a big indicator of the culture of the company for sure.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.880]   But do people outside of the circle really, really care about that?
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.400]   Well, let me give Sam a chance and the.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.440]   Sam, you did, I apologize.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.800]   Here you are.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.240]   You're an intern at the information.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.720]   Brand new to this business.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.320]   No, I mean, here's the way I would look at it is.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.080]   I mean, again, I, again, I have a bias here.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.680]   I have an opinion about kind of, you know, how I think about, you know, media consumption
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:59.080]   that I think the thing that has really changed is who do these, who do media organizations
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.240]   work for in the end of the day and who's side of the honor and who can you trust?
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.960]   And to me, I think I strongly believe and it's obviously self-serving that the future
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.280]   of the world is going to look a lot more like the past and that you will be paying agents
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.120]   to do serious reporting for you and you'll just pay them.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.160]   Like, you'll, and you'll trust them because their entire incentive will be aligned with
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.160]   providing great information.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.800]   I mean, I'm going to have to hire a private investigator to figure out whether I should
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   have an Uber account.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   No, you're going to pull it out.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.600]   It'll be like, you and a lot of the people will hire them together.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.560]   And that doesn't mean there was in places for all sorts of different types of media
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.560]   and discussion.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.840]   But in the end of the day, just you are how you make money.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.320]   But that's kind of what ends up happening, right?
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.680]   Do you ultimately connect it with the Silicon Valley startup scene?
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.800]   Is the kind of the bro attitude that we're kind of seeing, I think we're seeing here
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.480]   at Uber, this is fairly widespread, especially in early stage startups, right?
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.480]   What's the bro attitude?
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.520]   Well, yeah, this kind of we're going to take on the world.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.800]   It's us against the world.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.800]   I mean, you're, I think starting companies is kind of a crazy exercise, right?
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.640]   Like, I think you have to have that delusion and that drive to ever even rationally go
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.080]   off and try to start anything.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.320]   So I think it's, I think it's actually an important part of like early startup culture.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.560]   I think the question is, how do the things that do really work mature?
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.080]   How do the controls come into a place?
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.080]   What's the timing on that?
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.680]   And when do you wake up and realize, oh my God, we're winning and we're having a real
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.040]   impact and there's responsibility that comes with that.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.360]   You have to grow into rapidly.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.760]   And again, I think it's been said by others, but yeah, this is not a new pattern.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.920]   It's just honestly, I think this is probably the fastest, one of the fastest, you know,
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.600]   growths at least in valuation that I think has ever probably ever happened in the world.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   They're three years old.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   Up to that.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.600]   How old is Uber?
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   Three or four years.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   I think it's more than three.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.320]   In 2008, it was started.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   So there's, they're more than that.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.840]   They're six years old.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.780]   They currently have the, I think the most venture funding of any startup at a Silicon
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.120]   Valley, probably of any startup in the world, they're valued at what?
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.560]   A couple of billion more than that.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.560]   I can't remember.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.760]   It depends on your aspect between 15 and 20.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.280]   15 and 20 billion.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.240]   I mean, the growth has been insane in the last two years.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.720]   And it's a great service.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.680]   And people love it.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.800]   Although I think there are some concerns, legitimate concerns.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:24.040]   I mean, this Uber X driver who almost killed the guy with a hammer last week, I mean, it
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.920]   seems to have been more in San Francisco, I guess, because there's more rides in San
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   Francisco.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.640]   And I guess I'm playing my part as the guy sitting in Silicon Valley.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   You're the startup guy.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.880]   You represent the startup.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.640]   So I'm playing my role perfectly.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.480]   I feel like on the show, but like, look, you know, the reality is there's a lot they're
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.760]   going to have to figure out and a lot of responsibility that comes with being as successful as they
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   have been and will be going forward.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.120]   So I think there's a lot to learn there.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.720]   But I have less sympathy for people sensationalizing the driver incident.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.200]   I mean, you drive enough miles.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   Right.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   You're going to have an incident.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   I mean, you know, that's what Uber says.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.520]   You're a capping cab in every country and said, is there ever an incident?
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.520]   And of course there is.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.040]   Like there's no way not to have that happen.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.640]   So I think surge price surge pricing bothers people.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.840]   You know, they don't know how much it's going to cost.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840]   It's raining.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.960]   And all of a sudden it's triple the cost.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.760]   And look, if that ends up being an issue, then a company like flywheel, which I take
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.680]   frequently and doesn't have surge pricing or less will will win.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.400]   I mean, there's a competition.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400]   There's competition.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.320]   It's not like it's, you know, there's a one stop shop here.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.400]   But again, like I think these things are going to shake out.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.720]   And it's an unfortunate episode.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.040]   I think it says more about kind of the media culture and then anything else.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.400]   But it also like is a wake up call that I think a lot of executives at these companies
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.120]   that like, look, you're not some baby in the corner anymore.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.280]   People are paying attention.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.160]   They care and you got to be really careful about the message and image you're putting
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   out because it matters.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.280]   It's also the case that as consumers of news, we now have to look behind every place
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.280]   you go.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.920]   You have to, well, are they an investor?
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.360]   For instance, Peter Thiel, the well known Silicon Valley investor said, Uber is the most ethically
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.360]   challenged company in Silicon Valley.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.120]   And then you learn Peter Thiel is an investor and Lyft.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.240]   So it's all then now everything he says has to be suspect.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.960]   And it seems like everybody's got some allegiance to one side or the other.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.560]   And it's, I mean, that is a compliment, you know, from Peter Thiel, that might be like
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.560]   a good thing.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.760]   I don't know.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.040]   But I have to, I do have to point out that Sergey and Larry, broad and Eric Schmidt,
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.200]   a Mark Zuckerberg, broad and Cheryl Sandberg, that it is not unusual for companies as you,
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:35.080]   I think you said it, Kevin, they have to have this go go attitude us against the world when
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.080]   they're first starting up.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.880]   But eventually they do bring in adult supervision.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.680]   But the adult supervision they brought in is in, you know, Michael, you know, that's,
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.320]   that's the, that's the, he's the adult.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.160]   He's the one they, he's the, he's the like political operative dude.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   They've had it.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.160]   He was at the White House.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.560]   He was at the White House.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.960]   He was, he was at Cloud, which is okay, not another company.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   Cloud.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   Okay.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   Come on.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.960]   That is not a good pedigree at all.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.960]   Right.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.960]   But that's the thing.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.280]   He's, you know, he's one of the exact same how I'd into be this sort of adult supervision.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.960]   That's the thing that's, that's nervous making about it.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.960]   Okay.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:18.240]   I, it's, it feels at this point now, like it's a gossip story, not a tech story.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.040]   Which is, which is what Uber has worked very hard to make it.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.960]   You know, Uber has spent the, this week with some very expensive crisis PR people trying
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.760]   to shift the narrative.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   Interesting.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.720]   If you think, if you think about the stories that have come out and that have you composed
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:37.640]   piece and things like that, that's, that's a, for me, that's the sign that they've been
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.640]   working with.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.640]   That's product.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   That's placement.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   That's placement.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   Hey.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   You want to write a little story about your friend, email?
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.720]   And that's, you know, obviously they get to tell their side of it.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   That's, that's fair enough.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.880]   But, but they haven't done anything, you know, formally and above board apart from 13 tweets.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.520]   He, he had this right.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.840]   And they certainly haven't censured as far as we know, or certainly not fired in me
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.840]   on Michael.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.960]   I wonder, well, they've emailed everyone who says I want to leave Uber saying he doesn't
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.800]   speak for us, which is kind of weird.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.120]   He's our senior vice president for business, but he doesn't speak for us.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   He's out there.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:23.600]   I just, I just feel like, you know, it's hard for us as consumers to really know what to
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.040]   do.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.840]   And I think the larger issue is, is, is Uber protecting our privacy?
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.880]   If you're a tech journalist, you might not want to write an Uber just because you, I
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.400]   mean, what are they up to?
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.640]   I don't think that's, that's just an Uber thing though.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.200]   I mean, when I reviewed the Tesla Model S a few years back, I picked up the car, I was
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.360]   driving back home and I got a check engine light or some kind of a warning light on the
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.360]   dashboard.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.320]   I called up the PR Rep at Tesla and she said, hang on, I'll connect you over to an engineer
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.320]   and about 30 seconds later.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.800]   So you said, oh yeah, we're watching it.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   Don't worry.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   It's just a pressure thing.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   You're fine.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   We're watching it.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.200]   We saw the light in our control center.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   New York Times thing.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.760]   So, you know, I always have a pretty good idea that if I'm reviewing a smartphone or if
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.120]   I'm reviewing a car, that that company is watching everything that I do at all times.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.760]   And that's the big thing that I don't know about this old God mode thing is okay.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.920]   This guy was out front waiting for the journalists to show up was that journalist using a coupon
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.280]   code from Uber for a free ride or they're using their personal account.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.280]   You know, there's some details that I don't know there, but I always assume as a journalist
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.560]   that I'm being watched pretty much everything that I do email, things like that.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.320]   I think we can all assume as citizens of the United States we're being watched to everything
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.240]   we do and we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.320]   As I say, it is interesting that like this showing up at someone's house.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.840]   I didn't hadn't heard this story before, but that's just honestly and again with respect
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.280]   to whoever was involved, like this is just like poor form.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.160]   It's like even if you could do that, that's like clearly a terrible idea, right?
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.160]   And I think that's like part of like becoming more mature as a company is just being like,
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.920]   oh, like that seemed like a fine idea when we were a tiny company and now that we're
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.600]   not, that's just like a bad idea.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:01.080]   Yeah, but that's just cosmetics to say, oh, well, don't do that because that's cosmetics.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   Oh, that looks bad.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.080]   Don't do that.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.840]   You could still have the same, you know, you can have the idea in your head, but just don't
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.840]   tell me about it.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.360]   Well, that's the risk reward to it.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.360]   And then the end of the day, if I'm a noober and I'm like, look, the cost, we're winning,
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.720]   like the cost of getting this wrong because, and like the cost is blah, but I think it's
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   actually quite large.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.320]   Like, I don't think this is something that's just a tech press issue and gets blown over.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.880]   I think this is a big deal.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.040]   Like this is so expensive for them that they're not going to be that dumb going forward.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:30.600]   You know, Airbnb had its big meeting, a global meeting here in San Francisco.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   Liz Gaines was there talked and kind of compared Airbnb and how everybody who has an Airbnb
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.160]   service loves their CEO and contrasted the two.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.040]   And then at the same time, Airbnb has announced a device that as an Airbnb host, you can put
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.160]   in your house that listens anytime you want to see if they're having a party in your house
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:55.000]   or if they're smoking and it's like, Oh, well, I'm not going to use Airbnb anymore.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.320]   They have a listening device in the house.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.960]   So the landlord can say, and I.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.360]   All right.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.680]   What a world.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.680]   Let's take a break.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   What's shaving?
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.720]   How about that?
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.640]   We have a great sponsor and I don't think there's any conflict of interest here.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:17.320]   If I say that I shave every day with Harry, I have Harry in the shower.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.120]   I have Harry in the bath.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.000]   Sometimes I'll even use Harry here at the studio.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.840]   You've caught me a few times shaving.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.280]   This is more vember.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   A lot of you are growing facial hair and in it to raise awareness around mental health
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.440]   issues.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.440]   That's fine.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:40.080]   You know that Harry supports movember absolutely and they're even going to give money to the
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.600]   movember fund to show their support.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:49.760]   But when it's over come December and Jessica's saying it's time to shave that ugly ass beard
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.120]   think Harry's Harry's is the best shaving experience you'll ever have.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.240]   Harry's makes their own razors.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:03.360]   They bought the fact it is a startup that I like when when Jeff was a multi serial entrepreneur
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.680]   he did the Warby Parker when he started looking into you know I think we could do razors better.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.920]   He's interested in kind of reinventing these these old school businesses.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.840]   Well, it's a classic you know story.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.360]   We give away the razors and we make it up on the blades.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.680]   This blades you go and you try to buy a Gillette blade.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.000]   It's like what it's for bucks a blade.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.800]   There's there's there's so expensive they lock them up at the drugstore.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.080]   That's ridiculous.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.600]   So when Harry started they said we want to give you quality razors better than better
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.520]   than the razors you get at the drugstore at half the price.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.520]   So what do they do?
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.040]   They bought the factory there it is in Germany.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.280]   They found out there were two factors in the world that made the best blades in Solingen,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.000]   Germany they bought one and they engineer their blades for not just for sharpness but
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.520]   for high performance.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.960]   They ship them for free to your door and because they make it ship their own blades they're
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.240]   more efficient that means that you get basically you're getting factory direct pricing.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.600]   Get a Harry's kit to start yourself off the kits are an amazing deal.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.520]   You get you get the razor with a handle that looks and feels great three razor blades the
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.320]   foaming shave gel it smells so good.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.960]   The Truman set $15 I got a Winston that's the metal handling grave just even just a little
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.280]   bit more.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.920]   You get all that 15 bucks and then you get your blades delivered to you.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.560]   I was getting them every other month I'm getting a monthly now plus the because I shave more
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.360]   because it's easy it doesn't cut me up doesn't abrade it's great.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.040]   I want you to try Harry's this would be a great gift ladies if you want to convince
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:39.080]   your movember man to drop the beard and mustache come December.

[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.520]   first purchase with Harry's and you'll be supporting movember they'll give a little
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.800]   donation in your name and then get those blades delivered monthly or or every other
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.440]   month it's awesome.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:04.760]   H A R R Y S Harry's dot com for the smove ember.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:09.400]   You're watching this week in tech Kevin Marks is here old friend of the show we got
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:19.400]   them on regularly on a twig also a Sam lesson from the information and from Cnet the wonderful
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:25.280]   Tim Stevens so you wanted to come on Kevin you tweeted me to talk because last week
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.960]   I thought we had a very important show we talked about net neutrality about President
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:37.160]   Obama's request the FCC use title to of the telecommunications act to regulate ISPs broadband
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.880]   providers as common carriers we had a couple of I thought the best way to handle this was
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:47.080]   to have ISPs on one on each side we had Dane Jasper of Sonic net who thinks that's a good
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:52.800]   idea oddly enough and then we have Brett class who is a wireless internet service provider
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:57.920]   in Laramie Wyoming he thinks it's a he doesn't want that extra government regulation and
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.840]   I thought we had a very good conversation I thought both were very well spoken frankly
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.960]   it didn't help me because I agreed with both of them.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   What are your thoughts?
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:15.440]   Well I think I mean the what what you find is that the ISPs that have a local monopoly
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.920]   aren't in favor and the ones who are in competitive market are in favor and I think that played
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   out with your show as well.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.120]   Yes because Brett was in a very difficult market.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.400]   Brett you know Brett is doing something that's very difficult which is trying to do it be
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:35.600]   an ISP over wireless in a very sparsely populated area and so a lot of the issues around competition
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:44.200]   that arise in urban areas don't really apply but the challenge is the challenge for me is
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.800]   there is a sense that this is a natural monopoly and that's how it's historically regulated
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:55.520]   and so therefore the local authority gives permission to certain companies to lay cables
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.240]   in that neighborhood in return for something it may be a network for them it may be taxes
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.680]   it may be something like that but then they don't license anyone else or they only license
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:10.360]   you know very few companies to do that so you know I'm in San Jose the the self named
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:17.520]   Capital of Silicon Valley and my choice is Comcast or AT&T AT&T is giving me lovely twisted
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.760]   care internet that's not that's you know so we later five are sort of three streets
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:28.640]   away and with and we'll run some twisted payers over to you it's like so there is a physical
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.600]   infrastructure challenge and so the way that's been handled in other places is what we call
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.560]   structural separation where and this is this goes back to my BT experience this has happened
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:44.320]   in the UK BT was originally the post office the UK post office and then it was British
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:53.440]   telecom and it took over the telephone network and then it basically had all the cables that
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.960]   have been laid it had the terrestrial monopoly of existing cables and so to create a level
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.760]   playing field there what the government said was okay you need to separate the piece that
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:12.480]   the company that owns the physical infrastructure and sell connectivity to that to your your
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.600]   network company that's selling to customers on the same terms as you do to everyone else
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:23.440]   and that's regulated by government so there's explicit separation between the physical layer
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.920]   and the services the services layer and that was the case in the in the US for a while
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.240]   and that was the piece that was overturned by the change in regulations when they moved
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.800]   from different title to title one wait a minute wait a minute we never had the situation where
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:41.480]   the government owned the infrastructure in the US I mean no no but you had the situation
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:48.040]   where that they were required to open their open their plants yeah yes right now the telecoms
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:54.920]   are required to open their doors to other ISPs but cable is not right but also they're
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:01.400]   they've actually sort of effectively evaded it oh yeah I mean when Dane who was here is a
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:07.480]   DSL provider and of course he rides on copper provided by all the incumbent carriers like AT&T
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:13.000]   and Verizon and he's told me off the record some horrible tales of anti-competitive action by the
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.240]   big phone companies they don't want third party internet service providers right so they would
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:22.040]   they try to do it in a regulatory way rather than a structural way so the thing that I wanted to
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.440]   bring up was the idea of structural separation and where you where you where the there is a
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.600]   there's never going to happen in the US it's political dynamite we can't even agree on
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:36.200]   I'm very saying that that's another option I mean the other thing it would be I agree I mean I
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.640]   think the I think government should take over all the infrastructure using eminent domain but
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.360]   that's not going to happen no not saying that the other the other thing is what people have called
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:55.480]   duct neutrality which is other letting people it's as a task to lay other other cables right over
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:01.560]   the top of the existing network you know the cost of laying a cable from here to the central operating
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.960]   thing from my house will be approximately cost to replace the fence at my house you know the
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.600]   the physical cost of that is not that high and I replace the fence every every few years or so
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:16.760]   but you don't want five companies trenching out your backyard but but but the point is I can
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:22.600]   I could pick one and decide if we terminate at the other end right oh well I think there are
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:28.760]   solutions but I don't think that I think there's also the political issue and I think we live in
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.040]   and we're in a climate where it's going to be very difficult to solve this because
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.760]   well hell we can't I mean for crying out loud we couldn't even get a majority to vote against
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:43.560]   uh NSA collection of phone records this week that's true and that's pathetic and the other
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:49.080]   things it's often a local political issue right so that's the I've done my best I served on the
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:54.200]   technology committee here in Petaluma and strongly urged that because Comcast was not living up to
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:44:00.120]   its agreement Comcast has as all cable companies do a regional monopoly the franchise awarded it
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.920]   to it by the local municipality and Comcast had promised all sorts of things delivered none of it
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:12.600]   uh but but the city government was very reluctant and I don't blame them to pull the plug on Comcast
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.280]   because the last thing they want is every voter in the town of Petaluma pissed off at them because
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:22.040]   their cable doesn't work you don't want to mess with it it's worth it's we're we have this house
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:28.200]   of cards it's kind of working and this is one of the things that the the folks who advocate no
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.480]   government interference always say where's the problem there hasn't been a problem you're you're
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.640]   regulating to predict protect against something that hasn't happened yet and probably won't happen
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:44.360]   I don't know if there's a good answer yeah um but the the where the interesting thing is the stuff
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:49.160]   that that Google fiber is doing where they are actually starting saying okay we want to find
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.320]   some helpful municipalities right work with them first and we'll iterate through that and that's a
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:58.120]   good idea and then then find you know then put the pressure on the others get basically get
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:03.160]   pressure from people like me and say hey San Jose can you sign up for um for Google to do this because
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.520]   it sounds like Kansas City got a really good deal compared to what we have right so that I think
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:12.280]   that that is a good strategy but it's a 10 15 year strategy and and I suspect other tech firms may
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:17.000]   find that they want to do that too and what you see also is companies like AT&T saying oh yeah we
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.520]   offer gigabit at the minute Google comes to town oh yeah we offer gigabit and then it's not really
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.400]   gigabit yeah all right well I think there's a question also whether you really want Google
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:33.480]   controlling the end to end stack as well I mean that's a good point too it's it's but you know I
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.200]   have a very hard time with this issue I usually am pretty opinionated and I can see either side
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:42.680]   and the net neutrality debate in pretty clear contrast I don't know if you guys have read this
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:47.640]   book called the master switch Tim won it's a great book and I'm trying to get Tim move on but he won't
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:53.400]   talk uh in public anymore I love that book I think it's like the best articulation if you look at the
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:58.200]   whole history of media of how these issues play out um having finished it I don't think it actually
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.200]   like helped me make a decision about where I stand on it but it was uh it's definitely worth
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:07.720]   reading the more you know about this the the harder it is to come up with a good answer that's not
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.440]   either having government take it all over or I mean competition would solve this that's pretty
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.760]   obvious but I don't know how are we how are we going to foster competition we need somebody
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:25.000]   needs to invent a great uh wireless service that's easy and cheap maybe project loon you know Google
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.560]   announced that they can now do 20 balloon launches a day they've got project loon is the crazy idea
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:37.720]   of putting balloons basically weather balloons up in the stratosphere twice as high as airplanes
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.120]   higher even than weather and uh in the nice thing about the stratosphere is there apparently there
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.320]   are winds in a variety of directions at different levers layers so you can just control the balloons
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:52.760]   uh movement by moving it up or down into the layer you want so it'll go in the direction you want
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:58.680]   um and they launch these in New Zealand the idea being to provide internet access via balloon
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:04.840]   uh something like that would really would really change things they wouldn't it wouldn't though I
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:08.840]   mean you still have to deliver the signal down and the signal still regulates and owns the airway
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:13.720]   dammit radio chain frequencies doesn't facebook want to do drones do the same thing
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:19.000]   I I think these are all fascinating long-term technologies but they don't get around the fact
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.720]   that you have sovereign governments that you know have rights over their uh their airspace and
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.960]   their their wire line all sorts of things you have to interface with it's impossible isn't it
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:34.840]   what is facebook's it was the internet foundation is that it uh internet.org yeah
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:40.200]   is facebook zero is the is the facebook network thing right well they work with carriers in
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:47.000]   Africa right facebook free uh yeah internet.org the idea there's a lot of efforts yeah going on
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.880]   facebook right now to help kind of connect the next billion people um which are all really exciting
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:48:00.280]   yeah okay but sam now okay i'm gonna give you a chance because because of course
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   me the first thing i think that will of course facebook wants everybody online use in facebook
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:10.680]   yeah but i think the thing to go back to is that again that's a google and so does google
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.920]   there's no question that's true but i think if you step back for a second you know i really i think
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.640]   people sometimes have a hard time believing this but i at least fervently do and represent that like
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:24.520]   the the facebook is a company who is mission first in the end of the day you know mark i think when
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.760]   when the company went public had a great line about how you know facebook is organized as a
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:33.720]   company to fulfill its mission not the other way around and the the fundamental mission is to
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:38.760]   connect the entire world um so you know can you talk about long-term business what does it mean
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:44.360]   for the long-term business to help connect bring other billion people online of course like there
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:49.080]   that's like obvious but i think that the bigger thing is that this is like from a mission standpoint
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:54.680]   first not a company standpoint fundamental to like what facebook is meant to represent and do
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.040]   so it's pretty cool i think a lot of the efforts that are going on in there but they're all you
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:03.240]   know again very early in terms of how they're playing out i like this i thought this was interesting
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:10.440]   speaking of this notion of uh a pay wall and uh journalism that's paid for by its consumers
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.760]   google is experimenting uh with this google contributor service
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:21.800]   which i think is a great idea and i'm curious what you guys think about it the idea is you i guess
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:28.200]   that you pay a certain fee and google feeds that money out uh between one to three dollars a month
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:34.360]   to sites like mashable the onion and by doing so eliminates the google ads on those sites
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:39.720]   uh i think the the best application of that would be youtube and i'm surprised we haven't seen
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:45.000]   something like that already because people hate pre-roll on youtube with a passion i think that's
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.600]   a great opportunity for them to roll something like this out if you pay you know to ten bucks a
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.760]   month five bucks a month and no more pre-roll ads on youtube i think a lot of people would pay for
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.840]   that especially if they knew that that money was going back to where it belongs which is the
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.840]   to the content creators susan wojiskey has raised that as a possibility i think
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:07.720]   uh i think it's a very unlikely possibility why is that um well the problem with these plans
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.640]   honestly like youtube which is obviously a really important service for google in terms of where
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:16.840]   they're going is you get all the people who are most valuable opt out of your ads right like in the
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.920]   end of the day it's exactly the demographics that are willing to pay money for these things
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.920]   then people that's who advertisers want to reach yeah right what you're doing is you're
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:29.960]   creating this like reverse incentive right where basically you're you're you're removing the most
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.440]   valuable segment of the advertising population you're moving towards so i i would be i i would go
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:40.600]   on record saying that i would be shocked if they did this on something like youtube whereas i think
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:46.120]   in the content network on you know sites etc it's a service people have talked about for a long
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.760]   time there's no reason not to offer it and see what happens i i i personally am skeptical that it
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:55.240]   will work but we'll say it'd be kind of capitulation right it'd be saying well i guess this ad thing
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:01.080]   ain't gonna work so because because it'll undermine your ad model yeah now interestingly google has
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:11.080]   in a way tried this this music key if you are a google musical access subscriber uh you probably
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:17.080]   already have this you can apply for beta when i click the music tab the new music tab on my um
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:24.680]   youtube site i get ad-free music mixes playlist just it's kind of like you know spotify or google
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:34.280]   um all access except their videos too and i can even do these offline on my phone so um i can say
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:38.760]   i want to hear all the pop music tracks it'll start playing there'll be no pre-roll this is a
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:46.920]   playlist and it'll just play forever on uh on my phone or on my um on my device see no pre-roll
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:51.080]   Taylor Swift's getting nothing for this
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:59.560]   we'll see how it plays out i mean i think that the reality is okay you could turn the music then
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:05.240]   now what we'll see i mean i think the in the end of the day when you do the kind of mass
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:09.560]   calculation if you're a google what is google's current like annual run right revenue i think it's
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:14.360]   around like 40 billion dollars is that about right yeah you know these are these are such
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:19.880]   rounding errors right um and so the reality is that sure maybe you can do something on a side
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.760]   project around music removing ads except fine but like let's be really clear like for the things
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:29.880]   that are core to their business which is search and youtube um they have to figure out how to make
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:35.960]   an ad model pay and focus on that and everything else is really just noise um was this the music
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:40.120]   is this the music industry then did this i mean most of these videos affect all of them it looks
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:49.720]   like are from vivo i mean why are they given this away if i had to guess and it is purely a guess
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:54.200]   well say it's it's ten bucks a month right i think they're trying to get more build to subscribe to
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:58.520]   the google play music subscription thing it's just uh it's uh and this this is this is magnif-- you know
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.360]   that they've they've this is magnifying the audience for that right that was something i went to
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:09.080]   sf music tech last week and they um the head of the um google music google play music was interviewed
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:16.040]   there um and she said that they are their subscriptions are growing um and and doing well and they
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.440]   expect them to grow further and i suspect that the part of it that was behind this the thing is that
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.240]   the music youtube is a place people go to play music it has been for a very long time and the labels
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:30.920]   know this and they've previously that they've they if you upload a song um if you upload a video that
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:36.040]   has a song on it they'll content id match it and they'll put a buy this song link on it um google
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:42.200]   will get some referrer for that um if you um and the labels will post videos up there with the
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:47.000]   assumption that people will play them there and then potentially buy the songs um but they've also
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.160]   they're also want some of this ongoing subscription revenue which they're already getting from
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:57.000]   google play music and from um you know the other services like that um and this is this is a way
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.680]   of extending that into that mode so that that that one makes a lot of sense to me i think the
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:05.960]   the google contributor makes a bit less sense but i can see why google's doing it because the crowd
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:10.680]   sourcing the crowd funding models are starting to get some more traction and this is a way to keep
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:15.960]   that keep it inside their ecosystem um and the the advantage they have is they already have the
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.960]   financial relationships with these publishers because they're running ads for them um and this is
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:26.360]   and they can actually achieve micro payments whereas um a lot of the value of the um crowd
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:32.040]   funding things is that they don't they succeed better without micro payments so i think google
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.240]   is one fits in with their model i'm not sure it necessarily fits in with um the the consumers
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:42.360]   mental model there there've been these um there's been a series of these things where you say i will
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.080]   donate ten dollars a month to the sites i read um they've been people have built those over the years
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:52.280]   over the last ten years several times and they don't tend to work that well because it is um
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:56.360]   you have to get a lot of subscribers for that and the actual successes in crowd funding have been
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.520]   the ones where you let people pay very little ounce of money so people can say i really like
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.680]   this artist i'd like to give them a lot of money um i really like this i'd like to give it a lot of
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:11.720]   money and and work on that basis so the sort of the fixed price aspect of it is is i suspected a
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:17.320]   downside to it uh it does look like there's a slider from one to three dollars
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:23.800]   uh the more that's not huge huge difference the more you contribute the more you support the
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:31.240]   websites you visit yeah if you go to if you got to say ban camp you can um public you can say oh
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.680]   i can buy the sound for six dollars or i can buy it for three hundred dollars and people do do that
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:38.440]   for for artists they were i think that's a great idea and i think you should give them that range
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:46.840]   um what somebody in our chat room suggests uh Ken from Chicago that this is really just
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:51.560]   deployed to get credit card numbers i don't think this i think google has plenty of credit card
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:56.920]   numbers yeah google has a credit card numbers google google play stores is it's got yeah they
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:01.320]   got they got several of mine in the google wallet so they've always five of mine two of you know yeah
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:08.200]   yeah i don't think they need to deploy they need to deploy um let's take a break we're talking about
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:13.560]   the week's tech news with some really great people it's nice to have this is what i love about doing

[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:18.600]   tech news tonight uber senior vice president of business amel michael suggested that the company
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:24.840]   might consider hiring a team of opposition researchers to dig up dirt on media critics
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:30.200]   before you buy the review of the pono player really is much more than just a review of the player
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:35.960]   it's it's really a discussion of can music sound better this week in google uber has this thing
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:40.200]   called god view allegedly are you gonna delete your uber app i were at the deleted and said that i
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:45.800]   do not trust uber with my data so yeah i'm done all about android it is so awesome to just kind of
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:50.760]   say okay google and have the phone light up i'm positive yours is not the only phone that's going
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:55.480]   off right now you have to say okay google three times every time i hear them deep it's funnier
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:03.800]   no stop no twit i think he's going and going and going the next time you you see me at this
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:12.920]   set again these two turkeys back here will be gone what a day what a week it's been i got my
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:21.080]   next six right here jeff jarvis got his to eat it you know the uh informal skype unboxing that was
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:27.800]   that was a little wonky um but there it is six inches we'll do uh i'll probably do a review on
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:34.440]   before you buy on tuesday i don't know i brought i brought all my phones just so i can see there's
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:45.240]   the iphone six plus and galaxy note four not that much bigger than those i have to say though it
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:51.480]   doesn't have all the features of the moto x which i really like including the leather back how how
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:58.920]   does it compare to the next is seven it's very close it's almost just one little inch
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:08.040]   look see i you know i maybe it's just me but uh i don't mind a big phone i like big phones
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:15.640]   well yeah i've looked you know doesn't look weird that doesn't look weird no we're used to it now
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.960]   i've never understood that objection because the distance between your ear and your mouth is about
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:25.640]   that look right it's actually looks like a old-fashioned yeah that's i thought that's
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:32.760]   it has left left it's on their phones anymore and who does this anyway right right nobody talks on
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:37.160]   a phone with it to their ear so you basically take these two and sort of average them and that's
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.400]   what you get yeah it's right in between the two so i can get rid of both of these just carry one
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:46.760]   that i'm a little disappointed it doesn't have all the moto x stuff you know all the you can
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:52.360]   give it a teach it a phrase and it knows when you're driving and my moto x now when i'm at home says
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.880]   you've got a call from do you want to you want to answer it it's kind of nice i like all those
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.760]   features and it doesn't have them leather back or i don't know i can't decide this is a tough
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:06.520]   tough ear for phones i wish i just were one of those simple-minded iPhone guys
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:12.920]   it'd be a lot easier oh just get an iPhone that was the my massive amusement when the new ones
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.760]   came out and they were saying like big phones are really good and i'm going hmm yeah we've been
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.360]   saying that for far for a couple years you know actually i hate to admit it but i really like the
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:27.320]   note for it's got it's got the best screen arguably the best camera i really like it little thumbs
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.800]   every device yeah i've been using one for a few weeks as well and i did a really long-term
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.640]   comparison with that in the iPhone 6 plus just because i really couldn't kind of make up my mind
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.680]   but for me actually the productivity stuff they've added in especially in the the s note application
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.640]   is really coming handy for example take a picture of a slide in a presentation if you're you know
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.800]   sitting in the audience and it'll capture the slide it'll reformat it to make it flat and then
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.040]   pull out the individual elements within that slide so you can then drag them around in your notes
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.680]   it's amazing it's impressive stuff and the voice recording is really good for interviews too which
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.480]   is handy for me because i do all my interviews on my notes so yeah it's definitely been a big step
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.160]   forward over the note three from me and this is the only one of all of this bunch that you can just
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.440]   pry off the back i bought a second battery and you just pop it another battery and you just keep
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.200]   going battery life is such an issue these days plus the SD card means i don't have to
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.800]   worry about running i don't know hope samsung doesn't get rid of that feature they seem to you
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.040]   know they're getting there with the the metal casing and the metal chassis and i hope that this
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.960]   is the last note with the replaceable battery but i guess we'll see in it i hope samsung doesn't
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.960]   go out of business didn't they say they're going to cut back on the number of phones to 30 percent
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:39.240]   they're uh i feel like 500 new phones are you yeah there's still plenty have you played with the edge
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:45.880]   yet i haven't used the edge myself no starting to see reviews yeah it seems like a really interesting
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.560]   device but you know with all the accessories that we're starting to see for the note for
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.240]   the galaxy s5 i don't think the edge is going to get any of that treatment at all i think it'll be
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:57.560]   kind of a cool phone to have but ultimately if you're looking for support i wouldn't be surprised
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:03.400]   if that gets dropped so you think samsung might eliminate the the pry off back in the replaceable
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.680]   battery i i don't know i mean that there's such a strong push for thinner uh it does make it a
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.920]   little clunkier doesn't it it does but there's been some you know so much blowback against apple
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:17.240]   with the the ben gate stuff that may be samsung will will draw the line say this is thin enough we
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.840]   don't need to go anything we're going to continue to maintain that one of our biggest selling points
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.160]   in my opinion which is the removal battery but yeah i mean it doesn't feel anywhere near as nice
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:30.120]   in the hand as the that our six plus does us for sure or then or frankly the nexus six which really
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:36.600]   is got the rounded back it is a nice for the size it's a nice feel i feel like battery life is the
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:43.000]   it really pisses me off because here's the droid turbo and the nexus six both of which have monster
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.480]   batteries in them um and and instead of saying oh great let's make a a long life phone we'll keep
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.680]   the ten a piece screen instead they say oh well we got so much battery life uh why don't we just uh
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.640]   let's put in a let's put in a quad hd screen and then the battery life's back to the same you know
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:05.720]   12 hours everything else is i want to go all day darn it the and we know this is the case because
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.640]   the one plus one which is a ten eighty piece screen fine screen does go 20 hours with a big battery
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.960]   so it's possible but they just have to sell one of those i like it a lot isn't it a great phone
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:22.920]   yeah yeah i it's too big for me i'm i like little phones but i do i do like it i think it's a really
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:29.080]   solid device i would say that if you can get it that's the only limitation is it's hard to get
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:35.880]   at 350 bucks for the 64 gig version with the 20 hour battery life and of you know in every other
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.640]   respect it's i don't know how long it's going to be before lollipop because it's cyanogen but
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.320]   cyanogen mod is great that is the phone i if that were widely available i would say without hesitation
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:50.600]   that's the android phone to get this year i think i know when i first got i'd never sim card in it
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:55.800]   and i just like left it on it literally lasted on without a sim card in it so that's a big deal
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:02.360]   for almost a week yeah yeah which is awesome right are you did you say ten people are having
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.920]   trouble with the one plus yeah i seen a few people with issues with the display flickering and some
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.560]   weird refresh rates and some other issues so i don't think their quality control is quite up to
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.000]   snuff well and there's no support right because you call them what what are you going to get
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.240]   yeah exactly and if they're having this much of a problem meeting supply now how long
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.840]   you take it to get a replacement device or break so i i'd be a little bit concerned then
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.360]   i don't know i can't decide what my daily driver is going to be i just don't know well
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.440]   that's the thing i'm i'm a big fan of the next seven but it's obviously not a phone and it's
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:38.280]   just that little bit too big for most pockets you would like the six so i would so and lollipops
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.080]   awesome that's why one plus one sounds attractive because because right having that you know that
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:48.280]   that many pixels in a slightly smaller size with a battery that that lasts longer sounds very attractive
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:59.640]   the latest display mate results are in today display mate makes of course software to rank
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:06.520]   color accuracy and help calibrate your screens uh raman sonara who's the president over there
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:10.680]   loves doing these and i i think we could i don't know i feel like look it's got charts we should
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:17.080]   be able to trust this uh see there's charts it's got to be true but he says that if you look at the
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:24.840]   six flagship smartphones and uh tablets out there the clear winner is this is what would you guess
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:33.560]   a clear winner is the note for by far now i think it makes sense because samson makes their own
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:40.040]   displays so it makes sense that they probably reserve the best displays for themselves and they
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.360]   also give you the power to tweak the display settings on the phone itself which is a big
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:50.920]   uh big advantage to if you're looking to get really accurate color yeah the most accurate color uh
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:57.000]   very beautiful the galaxy note for when it's set in the basic screen mode has the best
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:06.120]   full gamut color accuracy skin tone accuracy far beyond that of the other phone same with
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:13.400]   organic color accuracy you know i'm pretty impressive if you look at the white point point zero zero zero
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:20.440]   seven compare i mean that's so much ahead of anybody else it's not even close the iPhone i'm
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:26.680]   sorry the uh is it where's the iPhone on here the iPhone is point zero zero eight seven so it's
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:33.720]   like ten times better anyway there you go there's the results the results are in the standard full
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:40.040]   color gamut is best in the uh does that help on the note for do you care does anybody really care
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:47.560]   how important is color accuracy really it's important if you actually i'm using it as a reference
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.400]   for something else yeah that's that's when you need to calibrate it but and when it comes to tablets
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:58.760]   microsoft surface pro three tie kind of close to uh with to the galaxy tab from samson i actually
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.280]   visited the testing facility of the surface pro three before they launched it and they spent a
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:06.120]   lot of time talking about how much effort they put into color collaboration making sure that
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   that display is perfect so who is that for is that photographers that care about them who care
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.800]   really cares about that yeah photographers for sure uh but you know you had to remember that
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.920]   color accuracy doesn't necessarily relate to an appealing design or appealing display for a
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:25.400]   lot of people you know if you walk into the best buy and look at tv's the color settings on those
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.240]   tv's are terrible but they're designed to really catch your eyes you walk and buy make everything
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.560]   warm and comfortable and that's kind of what we're seeing here you know accuracy doesn't necessarily
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.040]   mean it's going to be the best looking display to to the nay guy necessarily so tell us about
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:43.400]   tim steven's tell us about the uh la auto show um first of all is this a big i i know detroit's a
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:48.600]   big auto show so la as big as important as as the tridenta show not quite but it's definitely
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.240]   getting bigger and getting more important over the years detroit is still the big u.s show for sure
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.720]   and one of the biggest shows internationally but la is definitely getting big especially
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.640]   with a lot of tech announcements uh you know more and more auto manufacturers aren't choosing to
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:06.440]   make their tech related announcements at ces these days but we just see quite a few uh here in la or
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:10.680]   there in la i'm back in york now thankfully uh one of the big ones being android auto which is
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.920]   you know google's uh option for being able to connect to your phone to your car and use it in a
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:19.560]   safe way they opened up the api's for developers they announced them back at google i/o over the
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.040]   summer but now they're publicly available and you can actually start to launch and deploy your apps
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.120]   that will run within the car so they announced quite a few apps to have been out there that are
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:33.880]   compatible now spotify on the audio side it's a nice one uh what's app on the text messaging side
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:38.200]   and you know you're probably thinking text messaging while you're driving is not a good idea it is
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.000]   uh but what google's done is basically define templates for each of these apps so as you go from
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.560]   spotify to songs or soundcloud all the apps look exactly the same um and so basically these
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.840]   app developers are just kind of plugging in their functionality into the template that google has
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:58.920]   defined now this is different than um like the ford sink which is which is a computer and software
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.960]   built into the car right right basically all this does is it turns your car into kind of a dumb
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.680]   terminal for your phone to screen it's a second screen right and then everything really happens
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:13.560]   between either a very simple interface which would be on spotify spotify for example skip track you
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.880]   know next track thumbs up thumbs down that kind of thing or in text messaging it would all be
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:21.640]   read to you through the text to speech and then if you wanted to do a simple reply it would be
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:26.520]   again voice step back to text so there'd be no distracting displays on there and no emails popping
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.640]   up no uh you know text messages on your your car or that you need to read it would all be read to
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.640]   you or if it's too distracting it simply wouldn't wouldn't happen at all uh so the idea is you put
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.240]   your phone down you connect to your car the phone is disabled so you have no temptation to pick it
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.160]   up whatsoever and you get these simplified interfaces that allow you to play your spotify
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:48.680]   playlist or listen to your text messages that kind of thing apples to the same is disabled then
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.680]   the phone is disabled yeah so it's still charging up i want that i'm on my phone
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:59.720]   well that might be when we have to save fuel off and i can't could you imagine personally if you
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:03.720]   told me that i when i got in my car my phone would be turned off i'd freak out well it's not turned
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.160]   off though you just have a different interface to it right yeah but it's like it's like a
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:12.040]   turn off it's to the point where you can ask aggressive interface well yeah because you're driving
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:16.840]   sam interface yes you're in studies as studies study showing that if you use your phone where
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.440]   you're driving it's as bad as drunk driving uh so ultimately you have to be with that and
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.760]   make a hundred percent sense to me and i still feel like as a consumer if you told me the good
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.760]   news is you have a screen the bad news is your phone is disabled people will not be very happy
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:34.440]   with that that's interesting can you turn it off Tim can you say uh don't take over i'm sure you
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.840]   can't don't care you you can not you yeah exactly if you don't want to use the service then you
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:43.880]   certainly don't have to but but ultimately this now is giving you some incentive to actually
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:47.400]   have your phone be disabled because before you know there are apps from friends from other
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.240]   companies that will disable your phone while you're driving but you don't get anything out of it now
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.800]   at least when you plug it in your phone is charging and you can get an interface to your apps in a
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.880]   safe way you can still listen to Spotify you can still get your emails read to you you can still
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.800]   get directions to your next meeting and things like that um without having to pick up your phone
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:10.200]   and crash into school bus and kill innocent children i get it just sam i've been saying no i
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.120]   think sam you're i think you're exactly right i think that's the kind of thing now sam you
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.760]   probably drive a tesla so you have a 17 inch screen in your console there no i drive an a3
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:23.960]   manual so i actually have to use both my hands that's another way to do it have a stick shift and
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.840]   then you you don't have to although i guarantee you there are people who are texting and shifting
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:35.720]   at the same time i guarantee you i might be worried you're right i've seen i've seen some pretty amazing
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.680]   things to stop lights hey you're to stop light that's uh that's the time you should do that
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.760]   um what about the helium uh i'm sorry hydrogen fuel cell cars toyos showed a
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.960]   car that i think they're going to start selling in japan uh that has the explosive power of the
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:57.400]   uh hinenburg that's exciting it was interesting it was a big show for fuel cells and fuel cell
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.560]   cars are something that we've we've known are interesting but ultimately weren't really sure if
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.000]   they were ever going to come to market because there's the huge question of where you get the
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.560]   hydrogen to put into your car right now there are all of i think 12 stations in all of california to
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:13.560]   fill up your car there's 18 in the entire country of germany to fill up your car if you have a hydrogen
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.200]   powered car so that's the big issue but the technology that was the big story of the show is that
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:23.800]   technology for hydrogen for fuel cell cars is there is ready i got to drive the the Volkswagen there was
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.920]   also an outie there and yet toyota showed off their your eye which will be available for sale next
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.400]   year they didn't say how much it's going to cost probably very expensive in the order of 60 000
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:40.040]   dollars but you get a full fully featured car basically 300 miles of range uh on about five
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:46.200]   kilograms of hydrogen and that equates to roughly 60 miles per kilogram which is actually roughly
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.360]   equivalent to 60 miles per gallon which doesn't really sound you know it sounds good but it doesn't
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:54.040]   really sound that great compared to a lot of hybrids out there but the thing is a kilogram of
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:14:00.040]   hydrogen costs about two dollars right now else that's roughly half the cost of a gallon of gas
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.360]   and that's with such limited supply you can imagine if there are hydrogen stations on every corner
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.600]   they think that cost could drop significantly so these cars are going to be very expensive
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.360]   it's going to be very hard to fill them up but you know they there's zero mission the only thing that
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.960]   comes out the tailpipe is it is water vapor they have decent power they're you know as comfortable
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:22.200]   and as easy to drive as any other car and they're significantly cheaper to run so there's a lot of
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.320]   potential there but we're still waiting for that that supply to be there for hydrogen so you know
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.520]   who knows when that's going to happen i have so many questions so it's not burning hydrogen it's a
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:37.800]   fuel cell right so the hydrogen goes into a fuel cell which gives you a constant supply of
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:42.040]   electricity which isn't a lot of electricity but it's enough to power the car so it's essentially
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.800]   an electric car yes these these cars are all all EVs basically just think of instead of having a
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:52.040]   big battery pack you have a hydrogen tank connected to a fuel cell the same idea and they do have
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:55.640]   small batteries though because the you know if you put your foot down the demand is going to be
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.760]   greater than that fuel cell can supply so they're kind of like hydrogen powered hybrids almost in
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.240]   fact the audio that they showed up is a plug-in hybrid so you can actually plug that in at home
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:10.760]   and drive it for i think about 30 miles before it even starts to sip from the hydrogen tank but
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.560]   yeah they are all EVs just like a battery powered car so they're like the volt then that they have
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:22.360]   an engine as well or they'd be plug-in hybrid i mean nothing's just hydrogen and fills fuel cell
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:29.160]   only or is it uh the only source of electricity for most of these cars is from the hydrogen cell
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:34.040]   okay okay the Audi can be plugged into to give you a little bit of extra range on top of that
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.640]   but they have a small battery just to meet peak demands or be going up a hill if you're you know
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.680]   if you're racing somebody at the stoplight that kind of thing that fuel cell won't be able to give
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:46.440]   enough juice to get good acceleration and uh is there another consumable i mean doesn't a fuel cell
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:53.400]   require some sort of electrolysis process no the uh the maintenance on these things is is
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.760]   remarkably low there are some fuel filters and things that would need to be replaced every
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:01.400]   couple of years so there's no catalyst or anything but no you don't have to drop in copper into the
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.760]   fuel tank or or anything like that they're pretty self sustained and uh you know these are still
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:12.360]   early days for these cars so even at $60,000 Toyota is probably taking a bit of a loss just to get
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.840]   them on the market to see you know how they hold up to day-to-day wear and tear and weather and
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.520]   seasons and that kind of thing but ultimately you know they're they're based on production
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:25.640]   technology in fact the the Volkswagen cars are basically the same thing as the the Volkswagen
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.280]   Eagle if they're uh all electric golf is selling now just instead of having a battery pack they've
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:38.440]   got a hydrogen tank and i was being uh i was being jocular referring to the Hindenburg of course
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.840]   a gas tank is also highly combustible right uh it's way worse yeah because
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:47.720]   if you're hydrogen leak it just goes up in the sky and vanishes petrioleum goes across the ground
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:51.880]   and and because it's heavier than air and then you light it and you get a flame that's spread
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:57.080]   sideways so yeah petrioleum gas spillages is one of the scariest things there is anything that has
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:03.400]   enough stored energy to motivate a three ton vehicle is going to have some explosive power even
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:09.240]   lithium ion i mean it's just you're you're storing a lot of energy in a compact form to drive the car
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:14.680]   it's going to have some explosive potential we've seen plenty of battery packs go up and smoke and
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:20.440]   when they do they go very quickly and very violently not as violently as a hydrogen explosion obviously
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:24.600]   but these tanks are very very well designed they're carbon fiber for the most parts uh and
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.480]   they can survive a pretty significant impact for sure and then the refueling uh i guess to get us
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.680]   they're going to put in more stations they say it fills in five minutes which is pretty fast it's
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:40.120]   faster than a Tesla but not as fast as a gas fill up not quite yeah you can figure you probably
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.800]   fill up a typical car in about two minutes but one of the nice things is there's actually already a
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:48.840]   standard defined for hydrogen uh filling stations so you don't need to do that if you look at EVs
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:52.280]   there are a thing about three or four different standards as you go from one country to the next
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.960]   which is a major headache for everybody teslas got their own thing that they're doing uh this is
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.400]   one standard defined crossing tire industry so that's nice uh that's one of the things that you
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.240]   don't need to worry about i'll be like you plug the car in takes about five minutes you gotta go up
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:07.320]   to i think about ten thousand psi which is pretty pretty wide uh but then at that point you're good
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:12.040]   to go for another three hundred miles and then finally i guess the the question that really we
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:18.120]   should be asking is how do you produce hydrogen and is it produced in in a environmentally friendly way
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:23.960]   or is it just deferring the uh environmental cost to another location yeah and that really depends
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.520]   on where you are and where your electricity comes from you can get hydrogen pretty easily from
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.920]   alcohol from ethanol that kind of thing uh and that's pretty straightforward conversion in a
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.920]   pretty efficient way you can also basically make it from straight from thin air just by using
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.160]   electricity uh but of course the question there is where is your electricity coming from right
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:47.160]   right now that is basically just kind of passing the buck uh from one source of of contaminants one
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.360]   source of pollution to another one but you know the hope is at some point in the not too
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.920]   distant future will have much more efficient sources of power to the grid and then at that
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:00.040]   point hydrogen production could in theory become free or close to free uh and you know we're basically
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:04.440]   solving a lot of problems which is all these cars on the road polluting right and then kind of
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.160]   moving that problem up up the stream a bit to to power plants and that point we can solve that
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.000]   problem and move along but but again it tends to be from here in the northwest for example is a
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.880]   lot of renewable energy up there uh but if you're coming from a coal fire power plant kind of place
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:26.200]   you're probably just passing the buck right interesting um what else did you see somebody was asking uh
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:33.800]   how you feel about the new uh shelby uh plank what was it differential i don't know if that's uh
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:41.080]   in your purview yeah so so the the gt 350 which is fords and new it's the first guy anything
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:47.080]   uh it's it's their new it's the first of what we'll probably see dozens and dozens of special
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:50.840]   dish and mustangs over the course the run but you know they've just launched the new 2015 mustang
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.520]   this is the shelby gt 350 they didn't give us a lot of details about it um but but basically the
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:00.120]   shape of the crank in the v8 means there's going to be a higher revving motor than what we've seen in
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.800]   the past you know usually think of v8s as being big kind of throttly engines you wouldn't want to
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:08.920]   rev too high this will be designed for high revving and it's basically designed to be a bit of a
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:13.800]   track toy they're going after the command on z28 in a big way it's going to be over 500 horsepower
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:18.040]   they didn't say exactly how many horsepower but um it's going to be going to be a very nice car
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.440]   sounds very nice when it revs uh in that that crank that the flat plane crank gives it a different
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:26.360]   sort of sound to the ignition as well uh but a very different sort of mustang the what we've seen
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.040]   in the past i'm curious to see how it is on the track especially with the new independent versus
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:35.880]   pension which is basically too you see you ask about flat plane cranks and you get an answer
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:42.520]   this man knows his stuff thank you very much jim stevens and you you're gonna you do this you'll
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:48.200]   probably cover this on cnet right oh yeah absolutely we will be doing more mustang coverage as soon as
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:52.280]   we can get a little bit more time behind the wheel we did a big feature at the launch of that car last
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:56.760]   year i went to detroit to talk to the designers and kind of get a feel for things like i said this
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.120]   is the first big special edition of the mustang that they've done but yeah but they'll be doing a
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.640]   lot more and we hope to be uh spin some time on the track with that thing and i'm not too just in
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:07.720]   the future that sounds awesome and the new Corvette too actually there's uh look for some more coverage
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:15.240]   of the new zo six uh around ces time that should be a lot of fun too cnet.com/topics/car-tech
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:21.800]   you can read all about it i came this close to buying a shelby and then tony tony wang said
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:26.680]   you're it's a waste you shouldn't get a shelby you'll never drive it so i just got a regular gt
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:33.400]   but it's a nice car it's a nice car yeah it's got a stick so i can't nice yeah
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:43.240]   506 horsepower is that right on the flat crank holy cow somewhere over 500 yeah they didn't say
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:47.320]   how much it's gonna cost though which is a big question for other people yeah yeah those shelbies
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:52.120]   can be very expensive uh let's take a break we'll come back with more lots more to talk about
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:22:00.200]   tim stevens sam lesson mr kevin marx our show today brought to you by stamps.com and kind of in a way
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.920]   by the post office the u.s. postal service because if you are doing mailing in your business if
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:11.640]   you're sending out brochures or if you sell on etsy or ebay or amazon uh you don't want to go to the
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:15.960]   post office this time of year you don't have time to go to the post office it's going to be packed
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:20.760]   everybody's mailing holiday gifts and packages i got a mailer from the post office on friday
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:27.480]   saying how to be a postal pro how to navigate the traffic in the parking stamps.com i should have
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.920]   just said hey you don't have to send me this anymore i have stamps.com i don't have to go to the post
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:39.160]   office anymore i can i can buy and print my own u.s. postage on demand for my computer my printer
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:46.520]   24/7 i can print postage for any letter any package the instant i need it the mail carrier
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:51.640]   comes to my house picks me up and i love this usb scale because that means you always have
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:56.120]   exactly the right postage i'm the kind of guy because i don't want to send stuff postage to so
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:00.520]   i'll always put an extra stamp or two on you know that's always still money and of course a lot worse
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:06.760]   if you send stuff postage too that is not not that's frowned upon i think uh bad bad etiquette if
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:12.120]   you're trying to promote or talk about something cool and exciting and the port clusterware gets
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:18.680]   a postage due envelope that doesn't bode well for your business use stamps.com you'll even save money
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.320]   you can get discounts you can't get at the post office a priority mail a priority mail

[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:24.760]   patent war whoever thought that would happen remember apple was a primary investor in a company
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:30.600]   called rock star they bought the north was it nortel patents you would know about this kevin being a
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:38.840]   telecom fellow and they in fact up in Canada they had a rock star had a lab with people reverse
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:45.320]   engineering all sorts of technology looking for patent infringement apple was a big investor
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:54.200]   and i think microsoft was involved in rock star and was suing everybody especially sam sung
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.600]   the rock star lawsuits were kind of the latest in a non-stop uh... you know lawsuit
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:07.080]   mania going on in silicon valley apple and i have to think this is tim cook
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:14.040]   has decided to end this war remember this was steve jobs who declared thermonuclear war on
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:21.000]   google and android good news kevin definitely good news i mean the the less of this nonsense
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.720]   there is the better yeah because it is it's basically just a way for lawyers to tax technology as far
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.440]   as i can tell that no company ends up doing well out of this but does in a company i'm going to
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.320]   play devil's advocate have a right in obligation to protect their intellectual property
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.240]   um well the notion of intellectual property itself is a problematic one so that there's um
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.480]   oh you're just a commie but no it's a post-doc construction that there were there are three
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:52.600]   separate things that have been tied together as as intellectual property and promoted as a
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.960]   form of property as opposed to government granted monopolies designed to present to have a function
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:02.680]   and once you treat them as property then then people's metaphor for them is broken
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:07.480]   the point of patents was to protect the invention for a limited time and then make it public
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.920]   that's also the point of copyright copyright they they kept it similar term to the point of
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:18.200]   ridiculousness so that that making it public doesn't happen anymore thank you Walt Disney
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:25.080]   yep with patents what's what happened is that they um effectively changed the definition of
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:32.280]   invention um from something that that has to sort of practically exist to um the ability to patent
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:37.800]   abstract ideas um and that's that's when we had the explosion of idiocy there is that software
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.360]   patents is that really the fundamental issue software patents business model patents there's a whole
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:47.560]   swipe to unlock you can't add swipe to unlock come on things like things like that so um
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.160]   design patents as well yeah so the the the challenge with um
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:58.120]   part of this is a culture clash so the the reason that the telecom companies were very big on patents
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:04.200]   was because the model that that they had for standardization was that all the they want they
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.520]   very much wanted the whole industry to have the same standard um you know as you were talking
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:12.600]   about with the the fuel cells you want everyone to be on the same standard for something like that
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:18.200]   and so the model they did come up with was that you would um get every engine the all the
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.840]   engineers from every company together um agree the standards that front create a patent pool
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:27.720]   cross-license it and that was their work around for that and that worked that works well in their
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.880]   domain where you have to express these things in hardware and there are very long lead times in
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:39.400]   in building them so when you want to go from um gsm to 4g you want everyone to be building the
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:43.400]   same chips and actually have them interoperable so that that's the sort of worldview they came
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:51.560]   from and that sort of leaked into technology at the point where um we were working with audio
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:58.200]   video codecs and things like that and that became the notion of standardization sort of leaks across
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:05.240]   them there so that as these these technologies shifted from being implemented purely in hardware
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:09.800]   doing implemented potentially imprinted in software that there's sort of there was a there's a culture
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:15.480]   clash between the two modes and that's where a lot of this comes from and so you know in the software
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:21.160]   world we've we've we long ago realized that this was unworkable and came up with other models for
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:27.240]   getting people to converge which is open source and open standards models open standards groups
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:33.160]   like the IETF and W3C where we we all agree brought you know we still go and argue about it but it's
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:37.880]   not an upfront agreement where we say we'll we will agree or how this will work before we build it
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:42.280]   it's much more often a postdoc agreement we're saying okay we've all built these things that are
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:46.600]   fairly close if we make a few small changes then we'll actually interoperate better and if you if
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:56.920]   you look at the the difference between um the ISO for example and the W3C or even the ITF the ISO
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:04.600]   would with is this um effectively behaves like a legislative body and the W3C and the IETF behave
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:10.360]   much more like um documenting what has happened and agreeing to so that future people can do the
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:16.200]   same thing so they they've taken the responsibility for documenting the invention from the patent
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:21.880]   which was designed to let someone else replicate it after it expired into this much this publicly
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:26.920]   shared process where we can replicate it at before it's expired so that we can we've got a layer of
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:32.840]   stuff we can agree on so that that difference is is is key to the heart of this and a lot of these
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:39.960]   patent wars were sort of leakage from that um hardware centric world view into the the software
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:45.320]   world view um and I think what we're what the promising thing we're now seeing is that is the
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:50.520]   leakage is going the other way as we're starting to get more open source hardware but also as software
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:56.200]   replaces um a lot of the things that we used to do in hardware the the ability to use open source
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:02.360]   stuff for that and open spec stuff for that becomes much more viable I am which is the uh the uh
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:09.000]   blog arm of the ip media group Richard Lloyd writing says that rockstar reached a settlement with Cisco
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.600]   they have now settled with uh google he calls him an npe which is the modern term for patent role
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:19.640]   non-practicing entity somebody that bought patents but has no desire to use them merely to sue
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:28.840]   um they've also apparently dropped lawsuits against others apparently the investors in rockstar
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:34.200]   which include apple which put two point six billion dollars into it in 2011 uh have kind of lost their
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:39.960]   appetite for a suing for for a fighting the real question is what will happen to rockstar will it
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:45.800]   be sold to another non-practicing entity that would be bad but it it seems to be that the parties
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:51.000]   involved the investors don't want that to happen if they do sell rockstar's assets they'll sell
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   somebody else who's not gonna sue apple erics and blackberry microsoft sony and emc bid for it I
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.560]   think emc was not involved but sony microsoft blackberry apple and erics and her the parties and since
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:09.320]   erics and in blackberry are resting uh it's probably really more of the sony microsoft and apple right
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:17.960]   now right and and at some point you know apple has has sort of won the one the battle no need to
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:22.840]   fight so it's not merely it's not merely tim cook saying you know this was a bad idea it's bad for
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:27.480]   everybody lots of things about how we do business we're revealed in these lawsuits it's him saying
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:32.680]   we won i think it's a bit of both i mean i think it is it is a change of turn apple has been
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:38.520]   historically fairly detigious and also been the target a lot of um pat bale absolutely yeah so
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:43.640]   they've they've got a very strong legal team and it's it's a question of which which way um
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:48.040]   they decided to point them of course ironically you'd think samson would say oh thank goodness we
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:55.240]   like no instead there's countersuing in vidia and velocity micro in vidia suing them over the uh
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:02.440]   system on a chips used for the asheel tablet the ategra k1 and the tagra 2
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.800]   uh well so i mean the other thing is the way to think about apple and this is the thing that
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:14.600]   the area that tim cook is extremely good at is um they want to commoditize the stuff that they're
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:20.360]   that they're putting the layer on top of right so um for any given apple model they make um they
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:25.800]   will have multiple supplies for the different components and they'll decide um as they ramp up
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.080]   to production which ones they're going to go with and that was that was that was definitely true
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:32.440]   when i was apple when they were building new machines they were they were always multiple
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:36.280]   builds with different hardware components for the different pieces so they could try them out we
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.960]   could get the stuff for running at all of them and then they could swap out supplies as as needed
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:45.640]   and as as they've scaled up that that may have been harder for them to do but it's something that
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:51.000]   you know this is the piece that tim cook was would grew with the supply side of apple and
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.680]   understands that and in some ways that's what apple is doing with um with other industries in
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.960]   as well if you think about the way apple pay works in effect they're doing the same thing they're
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:04.040]   saying okay the payment model is all interchangeable we're just providing a layer on top of that
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:11.080]   um that's smart as you swap that out yeah we had the value to uh you know commodity uh uh
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:17.000]   back yes we had the design of the user experience and and the large customer base that that like
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:25.400]   what we do to your um service letter right european parlampen is poised to call for a breakup of
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:32.920]   google that's a good idea um the idea i guess is to put political pressure on the uh european
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:39.560]   commission to take a tougher stand on google anti-trust and anti-privacy uh investigations
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:47.240]   the uh financial times report that saw a draft motion from the european parliament that says
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:52.040]   quote unbundling of search engines from other commercial services should be considered as a
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:57.880]   potential solution to google's dominance that sam that must be frustrating for a company when you
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:01.480]   have all this success and all you get is and well in that case we're gonna break you up
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:09.560]   i mean i i i don't know the details of uh of how how the european commission documents have
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.560]   kind of teary out my senses like look when you i think it's actually not that dissimilar to
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:19.640]   the uber situation at some abstract level which is when you get big enough everyone says a lot
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:23.240]   of different things and there's a lot of opinions and the question is how do you manage this scale
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:29.000]   and kind of move forward is it unfathomable that a at least one or more people in europe think
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.520]   this is a good idea no there's a lot of people in europe like the question is like you know how
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:37.320]   did that actually end up netting out at the end of the day um i don't know but i you this is i i
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:43.000]   don't know how it's not clear to me how serious this is um versus how much this is there's a lot
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.320]   of drafts of a lot of things in the world yeah google google apparently is furious at the
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.840]   political nature of the motion they don't think it's a serious motion they just think it's politics
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:57.320]   in the european union so one thing i think you know i think you get to the question is how do you
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:02.680]   manage these huge companies in these huge systems where you know everyone has a very personal
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:09.960]   relationship with these brands and uh they're powerful right well the other thing is that this is
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.880]   the sort of maps a bit to the structural separation solution that i was talking about for net neutrality
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:18.760]   that that's a model that europe understands um for that side so they're trying to apply
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:23.560]   in this field and the challenge is is that analogy that works or is there is there another analogy
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:31.400]   that makes more sense um and the question needs to be which is better for the end users for the
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:38.040]   for the people um and most of these suits um in the EU have not been by people saying
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:43.000]   google searches is really bad it's been by people saying it's too good it's saying google searches
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.160]   too good it's locking us out yeah and that's that's the pattern there and that so that's the
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:53.640]   the challenge for the EU commission is to come up with a way that says okay what we we actually
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.280]   changed it would make this better for for um customers yeah the other parallel maybe the
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:03.640]   Microsoft consent degree where they said um we didn't like you bundling the browser with the
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:08.520]   operating system and so we're going to mandate that you give the users a choice of browser at launch
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:16.040]   a browser ballot uh that was the first thing so you know that that coincided with Microsoft like
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:22.200]   sort of sending the iet mount on holiday for two years so it's not it's not clear how much that if
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:25.880]   impact that had compared to the fact that other people were building and better browsers of
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:31.400]   Microsoft was resting on their laurels but you know the browser market has changed since then
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:38.040]   unless you think uh venal and stupid politicians exist only in europe good news after the supreme
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:43.480]   court decision against ario they've conceded defeat and ario now is filing for bankruptcy for
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:49.560]   some time they tried to convince the court no no okay will be a cable company then the court didn't
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:57.160]   buy it um ario which is only three years old uh and was beloved by people who used the service
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:02.360]   has basically been put out of business by the uh television networks it didn't like the idea
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:07.800]   one bit five months ago they lost in the supreme court and they haven't really been able to find
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:14.360]   a way out so they're going to seek bankruptcy protection uh it is chapter 11 so that doesn't
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:20.760]   mean they're going away just restructuring but i i gotta wonder what exactly their new business
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:26.280]   model will be um if you can't do look are they made a bet and it came up they took a chance
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:32.840]   yeah and but it would have been a cool bet it's cool bet i how do you feel about that supreme court
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:40.680]   decision did you i mean i it seems misguided i don't know i mean it depends
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:45.560]   a look the reality is i think this goes back to the whole my my best grounding and all this stuff is
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.880]   i really really enjoyed the master switch is a book i reckon everyone read it he's interested in it
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:55.080]   these are all the forces that work aren't they yeah it's all just kind of rehashing very old issues
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:38:00.920]   over and over and over again and i think it's like a reasonable outcome for the supreme court to to
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.080]   poll like it's not a it's not irrational no but it just pushes the world in a little bit of
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.560]   indigent direction for a while for a while it's kind of the key i think yeah i mean the thing the
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:14.120]   area was always a bit of a hack anyway they knew what they were they knew what they were doing wait
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.120]   a bit tiny antennas wink wink nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.120]   nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:25.320]   and it was was always a temporary play because as soon as internet broadcasting over the top
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:31.800]   happens you don't need area right it's just a matter of it was an interim product until
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:36.680]   local stations put themselves on the internet and that's going to happen that's going to happen
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:41.880]   too i mean i've gone the other way i've i've canceled my comcast cable subscription and put an
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:47.000]   antenna on the side of the house and so if you want to watch anything over the air we'll watch it on
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.400]   the antenna otherwise we'll just use netflix and but you're lucky you can't get free broadcast
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:57.800]   over the air we can't get ota up here in petalume what we got what do you i mean i'm actually
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:03.000]   curious i mean i do you guys watch sports for me i don't watch sports and so i literally we haven't
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:10.920]   had any sort of connection to anything live in years and it's never been an issue um sports academy
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:17.080]   awards uh there's the occasional thing live it's live programming right yeah the voice stuff like
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:24.840]   that yeah the voice really rosy really likes the voice please please watch his voice she drives me
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:29.640]   crazy because she dvr's it and that's sensible because there's like eight hours of commercials in
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:36.120]   every hour of television i don't know how they do it's an amazing miracle um but uh she she only
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.840]   she skips right to the performances i said well but i want to see what i want to see what girth says
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:46.040]   that's totally swift i want to see she goes right to the performances that's pretty sensible they'll
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:51.080]   make it like a ten minute show it's a very short show it takes no time to watch if that's all she
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:57.080]   wants you could just get those off iTunes because there's a run iTunes it makes her happy to fast
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:04.760]   forward the dvr um explain to me streaming photoshop actually we're gonna talk about that in a second
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.800]   take a break and then i want to talk about i think it's pronounced i wanted to say hoya but i think
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:16.760]   it's hola or jola the open source ipad alternative raised a million dollars in two days this is from
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:25.640]   the a bunch of ex nokia employees um and uh the chairman of the fcc says we're not gonna rush
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:31.960]   we're gonna take our time don't don't rush me man our show today brought to you by hover
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:37.400]   dot com the best way to get those domain names now you understand how the domain name system works
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:45.400]   there's a i can which then gives registrars the ability to register domain names and take that
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:50.920]   registration and then send them to the big you know canonical dns servers where prockett
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:54.680]   propagates down but you have to get a domain you can't just go to i can say give me a domain name
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:59.000]   you have to buy it from a registrar then you have many choices of registrars but i got to tell you
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:06.520]   after trying them all i love hover hover is the easiest the best way to not only get the domain
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:13.720]   names but to manage them it's there's you don't get all that upsell and all that extra clicks
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:19.000]   some of these places you buy a domain name and then you have to click 53 times just to get to the
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.360]   the checkout hovers fast and easy so if you've got an idea for a domain name you go to hover dot
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:28.840]   com you're gonna get that domain name right away right now is a great time to start a new project
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:34.120]   hover has recently lowered prices on more than 200 domain extensions including many of the top
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:40.120]   level domains they also reduced the price for new dot com domain names it's 1299 but that includes
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:45.320]   who is privacy because they know you don't want your name and phone number and address published
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:50.440]   on the internet so they give that to you for free with every domain that supports it hover is so
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:55.080]   great takes the friction out of registering a domain name their valet transfer service makes
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:59.640]   it easy i used well i should have used it i did it myself that was on there but i did transfer
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.960]   all my services over to hover if i'd use the valet transfer service they would have taken care
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:07.480]   of the whole thing for you let you know when you some domain registrars
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:14.280]   are loath to let go of your business they'll lock your domain for months as a you can't transfer
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:18.680]   out of here boy they're supposed to let you but believe me they don't make it easy hover will take
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:22.040]   care of it for you and then they'll tell you when your domains are in there they'll transfer the
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:28.520]   dns settings and it's free no matter how many domain names you have you pay ten dollars you get a
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.240]   your extension no matter what the domain name is i love it hover honest straightforward they have
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:38.040]   the best customer support around their famous for their no wait no hold no transfer phone service
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:44.200]   and they offer volume discounts so if you're buying a bunch of domains as many as few as 10

[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:04.120]   at h o v e r dot com you're gonna love them i should have i watched the video and i forgot
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:17.640]   now how you pronounce it is jola hola it's a sailfish os which is a skinned version i believe of android
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:24.120]   they're doing here it is the indigo go campaign they want to make an ipad alternative
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:31.640]   they uh november 19th they started they were hoping to get 380 thousand dollars to date 1.1 million
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:38.760]   dollars on the jon the say it again jola hola yola yola it's finished right
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:48.440]   jola so what do you think of this i was great this is based on linux so it can run android
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:52.440]   apps but of course you won't get the the first party you know your gmail's your google maps and
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:57.400]   that sort of thing but you know that you can run it will it be aosp or is it
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:02.600]   it's something completely different it's similar closest to uh to mego actually if you remember
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:08.920]   oh mego yeah yeah so it's kind of similar a little bit at least in in field to that but it's
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:13.000]   very nice os from what i've seen i haven't actually used it myself this is version two i think version
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000]   one was on the the phone that i think came out last year for remember right yeah i had a mego
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.720]   phone briefly that was it that was dawn down right yeah that that was that was kind of a last splash
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.400]   for mego and the anon which everybody loved and then unfortunately it was never
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:30.200]   followed up by anything i went to windows phone after that but the tablet looks nice i think it's
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:34.040]   a nice price point obviously a lot of people are interested and excited uh it's kind of interesting
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:38.840]   to see the it's almost like a spiritual successor to a lot of no key devices which i think it looks
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:45.240]   a little like alumia doesn't with that curved edge yeah yeah so you can get if you do the anygo go
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:51.080]   for 209 dollars they plan to charge 250 so it's very affordable yeah it's a great price yeah
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:45:00.280]   um and but yeah i have to say it after using the fire os and these other i just feel like
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:07.960]   you really should just get android or ios you a forked os is i mean i love to support these guys i
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:14.920]   think it's great i don't know the likelihood they'll be able to succeed at scale is extremely
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.880]   thin i mean it's just like it's so expensive not the one-time build of any of these things but
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.920]   continuously updating them keeping them competitive getting distribution and this is extremely
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:30.920]   difficult uh so it's a pull off i know i know basically i would argue basically impossible for
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:36.760]   a startup i mean i want to support them i love the idea these are these are all refugees from from
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:42.920]   nokia trying to make their way in the world you know what they need they need some hook
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:48.280]   they need to say like it's the private tablet you know like the black phone or something they need
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:54.040]   is they needed some hook that makes you want it that it's better somehow than android or ios
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:59.560]   otherwise just i don't understand why you wouldn't get a mainstream os it's also unclear i mean
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:04.040]   starting with it building a tablet an interesting decision i guess on one hand it's less mission
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.960]   critical so people are willing to build by an extra one take a chance you know take a chance
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.280]   who you know who cares right but on the on the flip side it's you know especially in this world
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.920]   you guys are playing with your huge phones it's really unclear to me that a tablet is like a
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:21.720]   meaningful form factor in the future i wonder really now that's very you're okay you're taking
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:27.080]   a chance you're getting out on the ledge here i'll throw it out there really i feel like i feel
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:33.960]   the same way but i you know it look at ipad sales they're they're kind of flattened turning down
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:40.920]   yeah when you have a six inch phone what do you need a tablet for especially these small tablets
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:46.680]   this guy's 7.75 inches which is you know very very close to to the bigger phones of these
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:52.200]   the next six or the note four if anything i think we'll see the ipad and it's still kind of getting
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:56.840]   bigger moving up to the 12 inch the 14 inch size you know just to to maintain some sort of a
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.200]   some sort of a niche ultimately that's still going to be a smaller niche i think the tablet
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:04.040]   sales are going to continue to decline but ultimately if you've got a six inch phone in your pocket
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.800]   why do you need an eight inch tablet in your hand you'd want something significantly different
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.200]   and that would be the one reason to have a tablet really but i gotta say they've raised a million
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:17.960]   plus dollars i mean somebody wants it so i mean my point of doing this is that is that these things
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:24.200]   are actually converging it's not that you know the the the phone tablet dichotomy was basically
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:27.880]   a design decision that apple made a few years ago based on the technology at the time
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:34.200]   and that sort of got baked into the way people thought about these things as separate entities
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:39.720]   whereas now there's there's a continuum you can you know samsung has a thing at every
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:46.040]   measurement between three inches and 12 and people can pick pick the ones out they want to use and
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.960]   the software is net has is moving now apple has finally shipped some big bigger phones from that
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:57.560]   dichotomy to this continuous you know responsive design model and i think is just a question of
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:01.480]   picking which which size thing you want to be using at the moment that's fair i think that the
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:06.440]   only argument i'd make uh contrary to that is just that there is a very different relationship you
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:11.960]   have with your phone versus a tablet which might be shared in a family or kind of used in a in a home
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:17.640]   by multiple people to me it's you know you guys are and i myself i'm here too you know i have two
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:22.680]   phones massive exception to the rule like people are going to have like a device um and that's just
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:27.960]   a very different pattern of having a device that's your persistent identity and log in and experience
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:31.720]   of the world it's with you all the time and has to be ready to be carried with you everywhere versus
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:37.080]   a tablet which is a casual use at home around the couch shared by a family whatever so i think
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:42.440]   there is a different pattern of interaction at least historically i gotta say when you look around
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:48.040]   now at people they are in love with their phone they don't look at their loved ones they don't
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:55.000]   look at their food they don't look at the road they are in love aren't they and i'm one of them we we
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:02.840]   are we gaze into the uh the eyes of our phone with passion this is what people want this is they
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:07.640]   there's the most the most intimate technology in history but i think the other thing is that
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:13.880]   we're starting to get them um the notion that you can move the snuff between the screens is
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:19.720]   becoming much more obvious and smoother and we've had we had bits of that with apple tv and and chrome
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:24.920]   and it's it's very obvious what you're saying about the the car stuff where it's like okay the
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:30.440]   car just becomes a screen for your phone um so there is this sense that you've got you may be
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:33.960]   carrying this thing but it can take advantage of the screens that are around you or the other
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:39.400]   places that are there and that's an obvious thing that people quite like but you've got to be careful
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:44.280]   how you don't actually want as you say your intimate messages appearing on the television screen in
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.200]   front of everyone else in the room um so you want to have some control over which one you're using
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:53.240]   for what i would say the analog is music think how we've changed how we consume music we used to
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:58.440]   listen in groups at concerts or where then we would have our stereo and it's got more and more
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:03.400]   intimate the phone is very much like the iPod where the music now is a very personal connection one
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:10.520]   on one despite the uh Microsoft's squirt ads where people were sharing their head earbuds i think
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:15.800]   really people pretty much uh their music they consume uh solo in a solitary way and i think
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:20.120]   computing is rapidly moving that direction no i think that's that's back and forth i think
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:27.160]   um it was a solitary thing um but the ability to to cast it to the room is useful too that people
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.520]   they sell a lot of these large Bluetooth speakers as well as a little bit of headphones i guess they
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:36.520]   do yeah that's mostly because i can't hold my phone my precious i have to put it down while i
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:42.040]   watch the dishes i mean i think there's there's no question we'll be flicking you know different
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:45.880]   types of media and projecting things and using all the screens around that is like frankly i don't
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:50.920]   think it's a very interesting business to be a screen manufacturer um and so just the question
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:55.720]   is like where is the the nexus of software and information and communication and you know i'm
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:59.800]   sure there'll be things that look the size of tablets or bigger tablets that i'll be you know
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:04.520]   pushing data to but i just i don't think the company's i think it's an interesting decision for a
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:10.040]   company to focus on those right now yes sam is that a replicator what is that behind you it uh
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:16.840]   that's a maker bot maker bot yeah nice what do you been building lately um you know it's funny i
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:21.240]   actually i was one of the uh the early investors in maker bot um and huge believer in what they're
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:25.240]   doing the coolest things we ever used to print is i actually used to have it in my in a conference
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:32.520]   room at facebook and i'd actually the teams would print out three-dimensional um dau and mau reports
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:37.320]   on it so we'd have like we'd say like have a meeting we'd have no no you'd have little graphs little
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:40.920]   3d graphs uh it wouldn't be through it would be a picture of the it would be a globe of the world
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:45.560]   yeah and then we'd basically do the heights of different populations you could see a map of the
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:51.400]   world oh man whatever happened to those are they like on a shelf somewhere i think so i think a
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:59.320]   bunch of them got chucked but uh no that is awesome data visualization that's the best use for a 3d
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:03.480]   printer ever in a long time it's a great way you know if you're blind you can figure out how we're
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:13.640]   doing global yeah wow that is very cool hey congratulations to uh jerry elsworth and her team at cast AR
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:21.400]   remember jerry left valve and uh convinced gabenuel to give her this these are augmented reality glasses
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.880]   that project the game space in front of you you're still looking through the glasses you still see
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:30.520]   the world around you and your opponent but you also see in the game space it was a one million
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:35.960]   dollar kickstarter project a year ago it has just shipped the cast AR has shipped their first pair
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:41.240]   of augmented reality glasses congratulations to jerry and rick and the team at cast AR
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:49.320]   they showed us an early prototype was put together what games is it run um i think that i don't know
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:55.480]   that's a good question it it's big focus is uh interactive gameplay multiplayer gameplay yeah
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:00.040]   you can play chess with each other and like see the chessboard right part of it is like taking
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:05.080]   tabletop gaming to the next step so each person has their own perspective and a 3d view of a
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:09.400]   virtual tabletop for example but you can also play like a flight simulator for example it'll
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.800]   project on the wall if you hang up the rights of material so you have a 3d flight simulator
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:18.360]   where you can kind of look around or you know a driving game that kind of thing too so it's
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:22.200]   definitely a very different sort of technology than than VR but um but it's it's got a lot of
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.360]   potential we're gonna have jerry uh we're having our next big thing panel at cesus here and jerry
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.280]   is going to be on our top cast AR. She is the greatest i am so i'm pretty excited but i am mad
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:36.360]   for jerry she's so brilliant and wonderful and cool and um and she this video is showing her
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:43.480]   actually shipping the first cast AR that tube is the playing surface so it casts onto a playing
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:49.720]   surface that's the core the coordinates so it's yeah it's really yeah for tabletop gaming it's
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:55.800]   awesome yeah it'd be great yeah it's like a retro reflective surface effectively so whatever your
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:54:00.360]   cast AR glasses project they get reflected back to you but not to anybody else so that's how it
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:04.920]   gives you a personalized display and everybody else has their own display ultimately you're
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:09.880]   seeing the same world but from different perspectives very exciting thank you i'm glad you knew all
[01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:14.440]   about it because i i played with it but i wasn't sure what cool stuff it's really cool and
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:19.960]   congratulations to circuit girl hey i want to thank you all for being here i just have one

[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.960]   this was this was from the uber a spotify announcement which was immediately eclipsed by the
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:01.720]   uber we're going to get you an interesting announcement directionally where the world's going
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:06.360]   i thought it was great you get in the i mean i'm not a spotify customer or an uber customer but in
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:11.720]   theory if you were you'd get in the car and your tunes would be planned all i want in the future
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:16.600]   is to be able to walk into a bar and have them change the music uh know who i am make my favorite
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:22.680]   drink on demand and i think uh i think uber might get us there over time hello sam would you like

[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:45.800]   ignore all this stuff your car you they know you're you're two minutes away from the restaurant
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:51.800]   prepare the table check me in love it yeah that's gonna be awesome let's give up this whole privacy
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:56.760]   notion we want that you can control it but in the end of the day and you should control it but
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:00.920]   in the day why would you not want that why would you want that everyone wants that
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.840]   stream yeah i want as i walk by the pants store i want them to throw pants at me say well you need
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:11.720]   some new pants here they are we've already made them to your size and by the way you can rent
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:18.440]   them just return them later that's right just throw them in the autonomous vehicle when you're
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:24.520]   done and we'll drive it back to us absolutely tim stevens he does car tech at scene at at scene
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:30.520]   net dot com slash topics slash car dash tech you can follow him on the twitter at tim_tivins
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:36.920]   always great to have you on and how many feet of snow do you have today um it's actually was up
[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:41.160]   over melting so we have no snow left at this point um it's going to be 60 degrees it was
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:45.240]   down to like 17 degrees a couple days ago it's going to be 60 again on monday so weird uh weird
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:49.240]   weather you're near buffalo but you're not near enough to get the the lake effect
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:54.040]   now we're we're we're along with buffalo actually out to the east part of state so we missed all
[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:59.080]   the lake effect fun that all those folks out west got to put down was wild insane yeah insane
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:05.000]   amounts of snow have you ever had that kind of snow have you ever had that kind of snow uh not
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.120]   yeah pretty close to it i grew up in vermont so we had some pretty big snow storms when i was
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:12.840]   a kid i remember just digging tunnels with them with my sister and making you know we had a
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:16.360]   hill we'd go sliding on and we just build a tunnel and go sliding down to the tunnel instead of
[01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:21.640]   on the snow right that's how you get out of your house yep you saw the picture uh the guy opens
[01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:26.600]   the door where if i wonder if that's on here the guy opens the door and instead of uh the outside
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:32.280]   world there's a big snow wall with his door imprinted in it and he put his beers in there and he
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:40.280]   yeah that was a good one he put his beers in it made a nice fridge oh man so you don't get snow like
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:44.680]   that where you are not up in all many these days no we don't get quite that much but yeah i'll
[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:50.840]   west out toward the lake i definitely can get a lot of snow real quick well i'll be watching the uh
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:55.560]   did you watch the jets game was it was it snowing and buffalo i missed it i did not know i want
[01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:01.720]   a football fan i could guess that's why we have you on sundays no one on this show could be a
