[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   It's time for Twit this week. In tech, a very special episode. It was almost exactly 15 years ago.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   It was 15 years ago, April 17th, that the very first show was recorded.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   It wasn't called Twit at the time. It was called The Revenge of the...
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   And we had to bleep the screensavers out.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.320]   But I am so thrilled to get the original three guys who joined me on that very first less than half hour show.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   You heard Patrick Norton. Who could miss him? It's good to see you, Patrick.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   Pleasure to be here. I'm just laughing because I'm remembering the threats from the lawyers.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   Which always makes me giggle with joy whenever I think of lawyers threatening to sue.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.320]   We got a cease and assist from G4 Tech TV.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.320]   And of course we had to be very careful because this guy was still working there. Kevin Rose. Great to see you.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   That's good to be here. I can't believe he's been 15 years. That's insanity.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   I think your life has changed more than anybody's in that 15 years, I would say.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   I don't know. I've had a couple of kids. That's a lot.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   I've got to be honest, I remember the furniture in your old apartment. You've upgraded.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   I'm looking at some mid-century design behind you. I see a beautiful home there.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   If nothing else, you vastly improved the environment you're living in.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   Like no disrespect to the house. The last house I saw you guys sharing.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   Oh no, we were living in a garage and we had used Ikea furniture.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.320]   That was Dan Heuert and I in the old tech TV days.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   Those were the good old days. Also joining us. Patrick's partner in crime on AV XL.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   It's my friend Robert Heron, HeronFidelity.com. Hi Robert.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   Hey Leo, always good to see you.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.320]   And your house is still empty except for AV equipment and that's as it should be.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   Pretty much. And yeah, and a brand new box right behind me on this other side.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   That thing. I got unboxed and I take a look at it. I can't even talk about it yet.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.320]   This is like the Steve Jobs photo where he's just squatting on the floor with the stereo equipment around.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   Surrounded by cool stuff. No doubt. Lots of cool test equipment.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.320]   I had the misfortune of going back in preparation for this and listening to that first revenge of the screen savers.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   Which by the way, the acronym TROTS was the worst possible acronym. Although it's gotten worse.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   And it was frankly a painful show for me to listen to.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   Because I think I was really over anxious. I think I wanted it to succeed so badly that I was pushing too hard.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   And so it was not a for me. It wasn't a great show. For some reason, I think mostly you guys.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.320]   People wanted to hear it because tech TV had disbanded the year before. Kevin was down in LA doing what was to become.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.320]   Was it the attack of the show at that point, Kevin?
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.320]   Yeah, I believe so. They changed it pretty quickly to the attack of the show.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   They got rid of Alex Albrecht which sucked. Because we had a lot of fun doing that show together.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   And then they brought Kevin Pereira on. And then that's when the name changed.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   Or maybe it changed before that. I think it had changed because that's why I thought I could use the revenge of the screen savers.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   And the letter said we're not done with that name yet.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   So I think that's what happened.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   Yes they were. Patrick and I were left behind in San Francisco. They didn't take us to LA.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   You know, it's hard to make a move when someone doesn't want you, doesn't talk to you.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   And then there was no reason to pay my own way to go to LA when I was pretty sure they were going to kill the show as we knew it anyway.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   You know, yeah, yeah, not just not worth it.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   Robert, what did you do at the end of the tech TV?
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   I went to G4 as well. I kind of went to the flow.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   We ended up setting up a lab briefly down there.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.320]   But otherwise I ended up working with the folks on Attack of the Show until they had another round of layoffs.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   And then at that point I took a good break and then came back up to the Bay Area and worked for more zip Davis properties like extreme tech.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   And PC Magazine.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.320]   And that's who you were writing for when we did the first show.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.320]   You mentioned extreme tech. Patrick was also writing for extreme tech.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.320]   And that was awesome.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   And a publication which I don't think lasted long called Extreme iPod.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.320]   It lasted for a while until lawyers came out.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   You know, we also replaced that with DLTV when we got our hands on the first, gosh, was that 2004, 2005, 2005, I think, end of 2005.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   We got our hands on the first TriCaster and built the studio around the TriCaster which was like, you know, after watching, after building the tech TV set, it was like $7 million studio.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   And it's like, well, we just did it for like 20 grand.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   Right.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   Right.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   That was like, okay, this is what disruptive means.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.320]   When you replace a million dollars worth of equipment with like $40,000 worth of equipment, that was pretty crazy.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   So people are doing it at home now with an ATEM Mini for 300 bucks and a couple of DSLRs sitting around, right?
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.320]   People think that Dvorak was on the original show.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   He wasn't and didn't show up, I think, till episode four.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   So he wasn't, this is who was on the original show.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   So it's fun to get you guys back again.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.320]   David Prager there for whatever reason.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   No, no, he might have been hiding.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.320]   He's always at somewhere.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   My wife was there.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.320]   Sarah was there in the background.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.320]   Well, the first time, yes, all of them were there.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   We did it at the 21st Amendment Brewery right after Macworld.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   But that wasn't, I don't consider that the first, because that was many months earlier.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   And that was like in January or February after Macworld Expo.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   And that was more just a test.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   But yes, Sarah was there.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   Prager was there for that one.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.320]   And I think all of you as well.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   So, yeah, it's kind of fun that you guys, what's interesting is shortly after that Kevin, you
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   left G4 and started revision three, right?
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   Well, I was there for one year.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.320]   Yeah, so I was at G4 for one year.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   We started Rev3 and I started Dig right around the same time.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   Yep.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.320]   2004.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.320]   Yep.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   So I'm the only one who's still standing.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   I mean, you're all standing.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.320]   But I'm the only, this is the only thing that started in 2005 that's still going.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.320]   That's single in the podcast business.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.320]   That's seeing a lot since most podcasts die after a week.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.320]   So the fact that we're still here 15 years later, no companies.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   There were no sponsors back then, right?
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   I mean, I remember when we were doing Ignatian, we had a ton of viewers, but then finally,
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   slowly sponsors started to come online.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   We had GoDaddy.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   Right.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   So there wasn't a lot of money to be made.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.320]   And then you look at Joe Rogan who's doing double digits and millions a year in Rev3.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   It's an episode.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   I mean, depending on how you count it, but yeah, it's insane.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   When we first started, I didn't want to do advertisers.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   I wanted to do, as Patrick has done his shows, we didn't have Patreon in those days, but
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.320]   it was a tip jar with that kind of thing.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   But that was good for one show, but it wasn't enough to pay anybody or have any help or anything
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   else.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   It was enough for one show.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   So it took us a couple of three years, but we finally said, "I finally said, "Okay,
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.320]   we'll do advertisers."
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   And yeah, at this point, we're entirely ad supported.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:09.720]   Although thanks to COVID-19, there's a little thinning out of the herd, if you know what
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   I mean.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.320]   I think that Rogan guy might make it though.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.760]   I think he's probably going to survive.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.240]   You know who's visiting real quickly?
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.360]   A pop in.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.720]   This was an old feature of the old shows I used to watch like The Tonight Show.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.120]   People would, Bob Hope would pop in and he'd be across the way.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.280]   He'd show up.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.080]   Look at this, a friend from the past.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.720]   Scott Harriet Squatch is here.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.880]   Scott was never, ever on the Twitter.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.720]   I don't know why I never asked you, but that's probably because you were busy making movies.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.320]   Yeah, still doing that.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.240]   Still, again, as I told you before, we went on the air here.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.080]   I make just enough to still live with my 87-year-old parents down in Southern California.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.600]   But it's been great.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   It's been fun.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.680]   I've been able to do primarily hiking films and have gone around the world.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.280]   Australia, Iceland, just hiked in Ireland on a new route last year and take about three
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.200]   months to hibernate, edit them together and put them up on Squatchfilms.com.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   That's awesome.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.040]   Some people may remember Scott from Internet Tonight, which was the high-end fancy show
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.880]   on ZDTV and Tech TV.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.320]   The one with writers, producers.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.360]   I think always look back.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.200]   I think Screen Scaters, though, you guys were like, "You were the highest rated show.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.920]   I think we were second."
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.040]   I mean, I think your audience brought a lot of people to our show.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.680]   A lot of geekier people.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.880]   Because yours was the show for real people, normal people about, "Oh, look what's on
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.880]   the Internet."
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.880]   Yes.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.640]   Which was so fun, man.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.640]   Those days.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:57.120]   Well, also, because you were a comic and Michaela Pereira, who's gone on to fame and fortune,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.640]   you guys were funny.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.320]   So it was a funny show and you were a comic.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.920]   That was easily the most entertaining show on the network.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.240]   But it turned out what people really wanted was, "We're going to install Linux on this
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.360]   box and it'll take us an hour, maybe it'll be time before the show's over."
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.240]   That for some reason, people liked that.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.280]   Well, you were able to do both to be informative and entertaining.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:30.880]   I mean, if I attempted anything of that technological level, you would be hearing the TV sets turning
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.880]   off.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.400]   But you told me you're a geek now.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.960]   Well, I'm more of a geek.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.600]   I remember it because I actually took pride at the time that I was really the pure end
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.720]   user host on the show.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.280]   Everyone else knew so much more about tech than I did.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.480]   And my interest wasn't in it, really.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.840]   But as the gig was winding down with the Internet tonight got canceled and then they
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.440]   were cool enough to keep me on for a year where I was on the show with you guys.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.360]   And I remember Kevin Rose sitting right next to me.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   And I remember thinking to myself, "This kid's never going to be a millionaire."
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.880]   And I was right on the money with it.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.880]   No, I ain't Kevin.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   There he is.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.360]   Yeah, you know, it's just great.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:20.720]   And then, yeah, I mean, I always look back on those times as just being, I mean, it's
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.800]   a cornball word, but really magical, really fun and what a great place to live there in
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.160]   the Bay Area.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.640]   And then absorbing all that technological info.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.800]   And then when the gig ended, I wanted to edit my own documentaries.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.200]   And I remember, what was his now?
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   Mark DeVito.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   Remember Mark DeVito?
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   Yeah, sure.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   He was the number one guy.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.840]   He's going, and again, and this is at that time he would go, "Dude, for like $8,000,
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.280]   you can get Final Cut Pro, a power book, and a Sony mini-DV camera.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.920]   You can make your own documentaries and they'd look good in a theater."
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.200]   You know, great, and that's what I did and started making films.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   What do you shoot on now?
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.640]   I actually shoot on a Canon HF-G10, which is-
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.360]   What are their cinema cameras?
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.160]   Yeah, those are good.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160]   Oh, those are good.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.320]   I just kind of correctly or incorrectly.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.160]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   This is a camcorder.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.440]   Oh, that's the same thing we use.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.440]   Look at it.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.880]   We can't get the T10 anymore.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.240]   We bought- Are ready for this, Scott, when I first set up to it.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.800]   When we first set video, which was in the brick house, we bought 35 of them.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   Wow.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   The great cameras.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.320]   How many are left, John?
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.120]   Not all 35.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.840]   33.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.840]   We're using it right now.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.080]   That's what I'm on right now.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.400]   It's the old Vixius.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   That's pretty funny.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.480]   And you know, we see- And it's so funny because we've been totally eclipsed.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.280]   We had Marcus Brownlee on a couple of weeks ago, and he's shooting everything on Reds,
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.280]   editing on- I think he's four or five Mac Pros, the new ones, the ones that start at $6,000
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.360]   with XDR displays.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.040]   He even has wheels and monitor stands.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.880]   That's how well he's doing.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.360]   And the times have changed quite a bit.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.360]   Oh my God.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.720]   I'm still- It's so funny that you're shooting your movies on the same camera that we're doing
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.720]   Twitter on.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   That's a story.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.480]   And though I just bought a Mark IV-
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.200]   K5D Mark IV Canon.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   You know, to shoot video and get stuff.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.000]   My next project I'm hoping to show what I think is the most underrated state for beauty
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   in America, Nevada.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.600]   Nevada, you think of Vegas and Area 51, but Nevada's got a lot of beauty.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   It does.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600]   It really does.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   It really does.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.440]   Like in the northern two-thirds.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.240]   So I got- That's about $3,500.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.320]   That's a fun- That baby.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:55.120]   And I already just test the video looks is sharper than the VIXIA.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   But yeah.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   So another old timer is actually in the chatroom.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.040]   Karsten Bondi, who produces this show, he's producing at home these days.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.160]   He can't come into the studio.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.000]   That's- That's no one can except me.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.440]   But Karsten was also one of the people who went to LA with Kevin and Robert and stayed
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.560]   with them until 2005, stayed with G4TechTV.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.480]   He says, "Mark DeVito, he misses Mark DeVito most of all the tech TV folks.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   He had the dirtiest mouth of anyone I've ever met."
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.320]   I'm saying something.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320]   Hey, Scott.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.240]   Especially given some of the people we worked with.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.240]   I know.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   There were some pretty foul mouths.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.000]   Scott, it's really nice to see you.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.440]   I ran into Scott when I came back to Facebook.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.360]   And it's the only good thing that's happened to me in two weeks on Facebook.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.840]   And it was great.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.000]   Scott goes, "Is this you really?"
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.560]   And then he says, "All right, if prove it's you, what did I use to yell during the tapings
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.560]   of internet tonight?"
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.880]   And I had no idea.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.360]   So I said, "Well, I do remember you yelling foul obscenities every time you busted a
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.880]   take, which is pretty much every time."
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.280]   And Scott didn't remember that.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.520]   That's the funny thing.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.920]   Karsten remembers the big list.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.000]   He's shouting in the chatroom.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.240]   And then I actually had to ask you, like, "Who, okay, name three executives in there?"
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.240]   Yeah, you did.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.520]   And as soon as you met Dreyben, I knew it was you.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.680]   I mentioned Peter Hammersley, Greg Dreyben, and whoever could forget the weirdest CEO I've
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.800]   ever worked for, Larry Wangberg.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.600]   Yeah, wow.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.400]   Those were my members.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   Those were my members.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   It was enormous.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   From that, that was cool.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   Good game.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.400]   It was a nice guy.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   And once told me that Larry Wangberg came up to Dreyben and said, "You know that Leo's
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   not bad looking."
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.920]   I don't know why Dreyben felt compelled to tell me that, but I wish he hadn't.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.160]   Hey, Scott, it's really great to talk to you.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.320]   Squatchfilms.com.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.800]   We're going to, you know what?
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   Come back.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   We'll do a little more time.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.800]   Spend a little more time with you.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.360]   I'd love to talk to you and catch up.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.360]   Be great, man.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.360]   Thanks for coming back on Facebook.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.040]   A little, yeah, that's it.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   It's after this.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.880]   A little pop in from Scott Harriet.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.400]   I am so thrilled you're all here.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.160]   Now, normally we talk about tech news.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.760]   Kevin, are you keeping up on tech news these days or?
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.760]   Big time.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   You have two kids.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   Tell me about your two kids.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.760]   I remember one.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.120]   Where'd the other one come from?
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   I have no idea.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.000]   It's one of those things where we were not planning it.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   That's for sure.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Really?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.320]   Yeah, because I remember Dariya said, "I don't think she wanted one even, but I think
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.320]   she said one's enough."
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.240]   Yeah, we were just kind of like, "Okay, we're in our 40s.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.240]   Let's stop."
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.240]   Time to get serious.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.080]   If we're going to have a kid, we should do it now.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   Okay, good.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.680]   Of course, these things take longer than expected.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:59.120]   When you go trying for a year and then you finally have one, you think, "Well, there's
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.400]   no way we're going to get pregnant again."
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   And just like, "Oh, man."
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.840]   It was like just a few months later.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   Patrick's laughing.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.360]   Sounds like he's been there.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.880]   Surprise, surprise.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   So tell me their names.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.880]   Or you can get a little...
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   Zelda.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.440]   Okay, Nova is the youngest two girls.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.440]   Oh, Zelda and Nova.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.440]   They're both girls.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.440]   And Nova's how old?
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   Just turn one.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.760]   Oh, wow, it's been a year.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.760]   It's a one and two.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.920]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   That's great.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   Chaos.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   Congratulations.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   It's fun though.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   Yeah, that's a good time.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.160]   And you move to Portland to get away from the crazy Bay Area.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.720]   Yeah, we just have more space out here.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.240]   You know, we're in the woods and I can fly to the Bay Area.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.960]   It's an hour and 20 minute flight.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   It's super simple.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   No.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.960]   So, you know...
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.320]   Maybe that's me, but it looks like there's a skate park behind you.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.160]   Is that for you skating?
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.120]   No, that's behind me right there is just a garden actually.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.200]   That rail is not for a sketching or a...
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.600]   That's a kid's sandbox.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.600]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   Wait till the girls get older.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   Times have changed.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.600]   Times have changed.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.720]   I did have a half pipe in my backyard for a while, but it wasn't for me.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   And Patrick has two, of course.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   Yes.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.440]   And that came after we started to it.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   Yes.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   Yes.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.680]   I'd have to sit down and put the math out.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   But yeah, Seamus is 12 and Tristan is eight.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.560]   Yep, there you go.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.720]   So your life has changed a lot and you also have escaped the Bay Area.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:32.040]   Yeah, we hit the rip cord, sold the house and we've been exploring where in the United
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:39.240]   States we might want to live looking at a bunch of cities and smaller western towns.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:46.160]   And right now just kind of chilling in the San Luis Valley because the virus kind of...
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:52.720]   It's really hard to get the feel of a city when everybody's hiding inside and running
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.920]   around with mass looking panicked when anyone comes near them.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:03.080]   So obviously you started this journey before the shelter in place.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.680]   This is kind of a monkey wrench in your plans.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.160]   Monkey wrench would be a gracious term in not using any of the expletives I might use to
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.400]   describe it in the privacy of a conversation with my spouse.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:22.480]   But yeah, I mean, it's been interesting, you know, because we were looking at St. Louis
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.360]   when things started to get serious.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   I'm like, okay, we need to kind of get out of here and figure out what...
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.600]   Because we're watching, we're staying in an RV campground.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.360]   And there was this...
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:44.480]   It's hard to sort of look at an elderly couple retired with an RV and think of blur and
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.480]   whoosh.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.280]   But essentially every Canadian who was...
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.200]   Every Canadian snowbird who was somewhere in the southern United States was bombing for
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.240]   the Canadian border as fast as they could.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.600]   There was this point where as the virus started to pick up one of the RV mags in Canada was
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.400]   like, okay, your insurance is going to be canceled in two weeks.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.760]   They may be closing the border and literally you just see Canadian license plates with
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:12.080]   like, hit it six, plug your power in, maybe water, and then it would be gone at like seven
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   o'clock the next morning.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.560]   And I was like, I am?
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.680]   And we were heading out towards Utah.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:25.480]   And then we found out that Zion was at summer capacity, which is insane for March, April,
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.560]   it was like the beginning of March.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.880]   And I was like, okay, we're just...
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.800]   We've been in the San Luis Valley before.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   We like it.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   It's chill.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   Colorado.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   You can find toilet paper.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   The San Luis Valley of Colorado.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800]   So...
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   Yeah, because we were in St. Louis the same time as you were March 2nd.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   So odd.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.640]   If it was the strangest thing, we couldn't get together because we were just in and out
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.760]   doing something for worldwide tech.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.480]   But it was really funny because the last time I'd been to St. Louis was with Patrick Norton.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.200]   You took me to a stake in shake.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.160]   You introduced me to the ways of the world.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.680]   The food has really the food game, St. Louis.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.680]   It's become this destination for...
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.880]   I was talking to a chef there and he was like, it's become...
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.600]   Because there's a lot of opportunity there.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.320]   It's incredibly affordable.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.960]   The Union loafer actually...
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.000]   See, I wish I'd known this.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.520]   I should have talked to you.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.520]   Because where we went, the Hote cuisine was the toasted ravioli.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.720]   Were you in the hill?
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   Somewhere...
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.800]   No, the hill's supposed to be good.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.760]   You know St. Louis too, Robert, huh?
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.760]   Well, that was me actually.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   No, that was you.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   Oh.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.560]   My whole family grew up in St. Louis.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.560]   Yeah, no.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.120]   So we were told, oh, no, you want Italian food?
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.920]   You want to go to the hill, but we didn't get to go to the hill.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.920]   So I was...
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920]   The hill's like...
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.920]   The hill's old school Italian.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.920]   So you'll either love it.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.640]   You'll be like, you know, it's not nouveau cuisine.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   I mean, I'm sure it's something...
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.800]   No, I like what's good.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.520]   It's red check table pots.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.960]   Keanu bottles with candles and that kind of thing.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.880]   I didn't see any Keanu bottles with candles in it, but it was...
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.360]   There was a lot of red sauce joint vibe going on.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.360]   I like that.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.440]   No disrespect to anybody in the hill, because there was also a...
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.120]   There was a deli there.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.360]   And it was one of those places where you're like, this place has been here for 80 years
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.920]   and they have all of their outrageous cheese inside.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   Oh, not that.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   Well, anyway, we passed like...
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.720]   Perhaps children's in the night.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.320]   Go to the City Museum in St. Louis when it reopened.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   I hear that's very good.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   Extraordinary thing ever.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.760]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.760]   We just escaped.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.320]   I mean, it was foolish to fly anywhere early March.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.760]   We knew it was a little risky.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.760]   We survived.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.760]   Thank goodness.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.240]   Are there a lot of RVers doing the shelter in places?
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.320]   It sounds like it if Bryce is...
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.840]   I mean, where we are, there's not much of anybody, period.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.120]   This is a pretty empty part of Colorado.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.920]   Actually, most of Colorado is empty.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:52.840]   85% of the population of Colorado is between Pueblo, Denver, and then some mythical point
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.400]   north of Boulder and south of the Wyoming border.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.480]   So most of Colorado is empty compared to that strip of the state.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.880]   But there's something like a million full-time RVers in the United States.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.480]   So I'm sure a lot of people are sheltering in place somewhere.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.120]   They just don't have to be really close to us right now.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.760]   This doesn't sound so bad because when you shelter in place in a fixed home, a fixed
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.760]   abode, you can't go anywhere.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.720]   But you can just drive somewhere and have a new view at your backyard.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.880]   Well, yeah, on one hand, yes.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:29.560]   On the other hand, most RV parks are located someplace convenient to the stuff you actually
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.720]   want to see.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.480]   And the stuff you actually want to see at this point, they close Great Sand Dunes National
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:40.040]   Park, Zions, Clothes, Brices, Clothes, all of the state parks on the east side of Utah
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.160]   are closed except the county residents.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.240]   So the ones on the west side of the state are open, but most places are just shut down.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:54.200]   And nobody's seen our license plate and pulled out a pitchfork yet.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.800]   But that's also just most- You have California license plates?
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.400]   I do not have California license plates.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.880]   I'm no longer a resident of California.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.160]   And California does not like you can't get car insurance in California without an actual
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.400]   physical mailing address in California.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   Oh, so.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.400]   Okay.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:19.040]   And it turns out when you leave California, the cost of automotive insurance drops precipitous.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.080]   So does everything else apparently?
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.080]   Robert, did you stay?
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   Did you come back to the Bay Area?
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.080]   Did you stay here?
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:30.520]   Ever since I came back up after G4, I have been living and working in the Bay Area ever
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.520]   since.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.920]   I love it around here.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.920]   I really do.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.480]   Whether or not I stay here till the end of days, who knows, maybe I'd like to get a larger
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.920]   piece of land at some point and build a home.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.040]   But that's a few years from now.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.560]   This morning, I told Lisa, we should buy a farm so we could raise our own food.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   Exactly.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.520]   And she said, no.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.920]   She said, I would end up doing all the work.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.800]   She said, I'm not doing that.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.160]   I'm imagining you gathering the eggs at the morning and then weeding the garden.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.800]   And I'm just not putting those two together, Leo.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   It's okay.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:12.080]   Leo at canning season, I would pay you to do to can something with me.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.680]   I would laugh my ass off the entire time.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.520]   I think it would be hysterical to watch you trying to can vegetables.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.840]   Hey, dude, I got a sewing machine.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.680]   I'm making my own masks.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.120]   Did you actually sew that yourself?
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.120]   Yes.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.600]   But that's awesome.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.440]   I got a sewing machine and I'm making sourdough bread.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.920]   I'm getting a little more domestic.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.920]   This is amazing.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   I've said I'm not going to form.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.320]   That's the only thing I've ever heard of you actually.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.480]   I'm a makeup man.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   I'm a makeup man.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   And you know what's great?
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.960]   I think masks.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.760]   First of all, we're going to be wearing these for a long time.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.080]   So might as well make them styling, right?
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.000]   This is going to live in Antsie, man.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   This is going to be for a year or two and by that time we'll be so used to it.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.360]   I think it's the new fashion.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   So I'm ready.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.520]   I'm going to have a little side business.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.280]   Leo's, my mom said you should put your name on them.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.000]   I said, no, I don't think so.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.280]   Get your Antsie account fired up.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.280]   Get my Antsie.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:06.480]   Got a V.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.280]   Antsie.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.440]   And all right, I just wanted to catch up with all three of you.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.000]   It's so nice to see you.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.160]   We'll do a little tech news.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.160]   There is a little tech news.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.000]   We could talk a little bit about the tech news just as we had in the old days effect.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.880]   Before we go after we do the ad, I want to talk a little bit about the tech news 15
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.840]   years ago, what we were talking about.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.840]   All goodness.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.760]   It was a little different.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.320]   I showed you they brought to you by ExpressVPN 15 years ago.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   We didn't have VPNs.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.560]   If you had a VPN, I remember you had to have like a Cisco client and it was real complicated
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.560]   setup.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:42.280]   And the only reason people used VPNs was because they wanted to get on the work intranet from
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   the outside.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:48.440]   There was lots of security to do it, but it introduced some people to the idea that you
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:54.920]   could have an encrypted channel between where you are and where you want to be.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.440]   At first it was just work, but then people thought, well, we could put VPN servers other
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.200]   places, couldn't we?
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.800]   And VPN started exploding, virtual private networks.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.680]   Today, you'd be nuts to go to an open Wi-Fi access point, a coffee shop or anywhere and
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.240]   not have a VPN protecting you.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.720]   More and more people are using VPNs at home.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.360]   There are a number of reasons why you'd want to use it from home.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.520]   Of course, number one privacy, right?
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:29.000]   Your internet service providers watching everything you do with a VPN, they can't see.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.920]   You also have an anonymity because you emerge under the internet on an ExpressVPN server,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.040]   the same server IP address used by other ExpressVPN customers, thousands of them.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.520]   So no one knows that it's you.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.960]   So if you're a Netflix subscriber, for instance, you can watch Netflix UK by just pressing
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.520]   the button and saying, I want to go to London, Netflix, Japan, there's a lot of anime.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.040]   You can watch Doctor Who on Netflix UK, Netflix, Canada.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.400]   So if you're running out of stuff to watch, ExpressVPN is a great way to do that.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:06.480]   ExpressVPN is also fast.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.840]   And that's one of the advantages of it.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.280]   ExpressVPN is so fast you can watch HD video.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:19.880]   So if you're running out of things to watch, ExpressVPN at home, if you're not using ExpressVPN,
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.720]   it's like leaving your front door unlocked every time you go out.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.440]   Nothing may happen for a long time, but eventually you're going to be paying for it.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:34.520]   And the easiest thing to do is ExpressVPN, Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, everywhere, even
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:40.280]   on your smart TV or your streaming device, ExpressVPN is the easiest way to secure your
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   internet.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.320]   So the only question is why haven't you started using it yet?
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.320]   We've got a deal.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.280]   Maybe this will be the thing that'll put you over the top.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   ExpressVPN.com/twit, you'll get three extra months free when you buy a one year package.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:59.000]   The number one trusted VPN in the world, ExpressVPN.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.040]   By the way, their privacy policy has been independently audited and the auditors said,
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.880]   "Yep, it's exactly what they said it is."
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.960]   They use trusted server, which is a really cool technology.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:13.720]   The VPN server only spins up when you log in and it's sandbox, so it can't write to
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.240]   the hard drive the entire time you're using it, then disappears when you log out.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.440]   No trace of your presence is ever recorded.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.760]   Absolute privacy, the third party auditing team also said, "Yep, that's exactly what
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.280]   trusted server does and it works."
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:34.440]   ExpressVPN.com/twit, we thank them for their support for this week in tech.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:41.240]   I thank you for supporting Twit by using that address, ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.760]   So I don't see you guys as iPhone SE users somehow.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.760]   I am actually.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.760]   Are you?
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.760]   Yeah, I ordered one.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   Are you excited?
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.760]   Yeah, kind of.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.760]   Did you get the red?
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.120]   Yeah, I got the red.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.600]   The red's beautiful.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:03.720]   I got the red because I've got another cracked phone and it's smaller and so I'm going to
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   use it.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   Looks great.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   It's got a great chip in it.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   It's great.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   I wish they had a headphone jack.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.840]   It feels a little hypocritical to offer an inexpensive.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:20.760]   It's only $400, relatively expensive iPhone, but say, "Oh, but you have to buy $150 Bluetooth.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.280]   Your phone's to use it."
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.280]   That's kind of-
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   You don't have to.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.880]   Oh, I guess you could use an adapter, huh?
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:34.320]   If you use an adapter, you can use the Apple adapter isn't bad.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.320]   It doesn't come with that, but I guess it's only 20 bucks.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   Of course not.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   Well, the Apple tax has to come somewhere.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:45.080]   I'm just laughing because I basically have this phone except I have it with a slower processor.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.080]   It's the iPhone 8.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.080]   The camera's by the same.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   You have the iPhone 8.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.200]   Yeah, I bought this like eight months ago or something.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   Of course.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.200]   They came out with it.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.200]   They came out with it.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.520]   Well, the reason I bring it up is on the original screen savers, Kevin was talking about his
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.520]   sidekick two phone.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.520]   No.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.520]   That was nice.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.520]   Are you serious?
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.520]   Yes.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.320]   I have recorded evidence.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.480]   You loved it.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.480]   That was a great phone.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   Remember that?
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.480]   It's the keyboard?
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.480]   Yeah, it was a flip out.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.960]   I remember Paris Hilton had one with like diamonds all over it or something.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.400]   Those were such ridiculous days.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.720]   Those were ridiculous days.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.960]   Danger, hip-top.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.960]   It does.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.840]   Scooter X is telling me that the SE does come with the lightning connector earbuds.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.840]   So I guess, all right.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.840]   All right.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.760]   I'll give them a pass on that.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.720]   But Kevin, you could afford any phone you want.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.720]   Why would you get an SE?
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:46.160]   Well, I mean, if I have a phone that's not really functioning right now, so it's time
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.160]   to upgrade.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.160]   Anything is better than nothing.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.760]   And so getting the SE, it's just like the latest and it's small.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.280]   I actually prefer to have something a little bit slimmer.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.240]   And I don't typically use cases because I like to just slide them in and out of my
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.240]   pocket.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.160]   I think this will just be a little bit more durable.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   It seems that way anyway.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.800]   I tempered glass screen protectors will change your life.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.560]   I was going to say that.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.920]   I hate putting everything on the screen.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.240]   Well, I do too.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:22.040]   I know, but I went from breaking a screen every three to six months to having not broken one
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.880]   in, I don't know, a long time.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.320]   It's tempered glass break instead or nothing breaks.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   Tempered glass breaks.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.320]   This could be called M-film.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.800]   They sell them on Amazon.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   They're cheap.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.840]   They're like seven bucks for two or something like that.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.880]   The tempered glass essentially distributes the force.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.680]   You'll fracture the glass, but you'll fracture the tempered glass, but it'll protect the
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.680]   screen below it.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.840]   I'm sure if you start wailing it against a concrete wall, you can shatter the screen.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.520]   So it feels, it doesn't feel like plastic then it feels more like glass glass.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.320]   It's actually tempered glass.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.440]   Yeah, that's the problem I've always had.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.440]   I hate the glass glass.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.840]   So yeah, I don't want the soft plastic.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.400]   It doesn't feel right.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.760]   So this, once you apply it, first of all, it's easier to apply it than plastic because
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.120]   you don't get bubbles and stuff.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.440]   And once you apply it, does it feel the same as the phone did without it?
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.400]   As far as I'm concerned, at this point I got so tired at one point I went through like
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.480]   three screens in a year, eight months or a year.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.400]   And then I started using the tempered glass ones and I just simply refused to operate
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:28.080]   a phone without a tempered glass screen protector because, you know, there was the one point
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.360]   where I had a screen shatter and I didn't have time to get it fixed and I couldn't find
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   the parts for it.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.360]   You know, I'm ending up with like little pieces of glass embedded in my thumb.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:41.000]   At this point, I can't really, you know, gorilla glass, whatever versus tempered glass.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   My thumb can't feel the difference.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.840]   So I'm happy and my screens aren't breaking.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.840]   I'm super Kevin.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:55.640]   I thought you'd be, for some reason, I just, I mean, I have a certain probably incorrect
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.320]   vision of you, a one plus eight guy.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.960]   I just thought you'd get that new one plus.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   The one plus?
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   No.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   Not an Android guy at all.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   You know, I dabble in Android and it's like I every year I get super excited.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.360]   I get the latest pixel or whatever.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.560]   Maybe I just want to try it out.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:19.800]   I just, you know, the polish, I always expect it to be the year for Android.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.040]   You know, I get the device.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.200]   I install my apps and then it's not it's the deer, the desktop Linux.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.600]   Well, there'll be something really cool that comes out on iOS, like some type of new app
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.360]   or, you know, a new product and then you'll get it on Android and you'll be like, damn,
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.560]   they just, they didn't hire enough Android engineers.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.520]   This is a crappy version of the iOS version.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.120]   So it's a bummer.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:47.760]   It's a yeah, that's funny because I feel like the dark tipper would want to have like his
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.760]   own ROMs.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.760]   I don't know.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.080]   I guess those days are, you know, you don't have time for that kind of stuff.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:01.240]   Well, I do still love to dabble, you know, it's like, I think I do have a pixel.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.840]   It's actually next to my bed and I use it at night when my other phone is charging.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   Yes.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.480]   You know, as part of my job, I'm looking at different, you know, new startups and new
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.560]   apps and things like that.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.320]   So I'm always installing.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.960]   So I have to have an Android device.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.040]   And so that's, that's what I use my pixel for.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.280]   You're absolutely iOS only though, as I remember.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:27.000]   Well, I'm not talking about one, I'm talking about ones that I'm funding as a venture capitalist,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.360]   like ones that I'm trying to find to invest in.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.040]   So that was the oak, the meditation app that you did.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   Was that what it was?
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.800]   So it was only iOS and the same was zero, the Internet of fasting app.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.600]   Zero actually has Android now.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.080]   So, okay.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.800]   Have you kind of spun those off or do you still, are you still actively involved?
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:52.000]   So those two are now under one umbrella, a company called Big Sky Health that a former
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.680]   colleague of mine at Dig Mike Maser is running them full time.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.600]   So we've since funded them at True Ventures, which is where I work.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.400]   And yeah, they're, they're doing great.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.200]   Zero is, for an imminent fasting has been insane.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.200]   It's a great app.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   I used it for a while.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   It's really good.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.040]   We've been doing over 20,000 downloads a day now.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.840]   And I think we had 55 million fast done so far.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.520]   So it's, it's been crazy.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.880]   It's been crazy to watch that grow.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.800]   So Robert, I'm figuring you're definitely a pixel guy.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   Yup.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   Ah, I got one.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   I got one.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   I got one.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.120]   I love Google Fi.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.200]   I think that's probably the number one that's amazing.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.600]   I use a Google phone.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:40.480]   And for that alone, it's the simplicity of the billing, the international support for
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.640]   travel.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.200]   I never have to think about it.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.520]   So on the first edition of the Revenge of the Screen Savers, the 15 year old edition,
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.800]   you were singing the praises of Verizon.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.720]   And Kevin Chimes is, "Yeah, Verizon's great."
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.720]   I'm still on Verizon.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   Okay.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:02.240]   But I have, but I will say I have a Google Fi that just sits there as like my data only
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   option.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.960]   And then if I'm going international, like Robert said, is just like you turn that on,
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.960]   you tether them to each other.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.680]   And then you just don't even have to worry about it.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.120]   Because yeah, the billing and everything is horrible internationally.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.760]   I have Fi on my iPad because it works.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.400]   It's, it becomes T-Mobile, but it works.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.080]   And I do have a Pixel 4 with Fi.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.080]   So I agree with you.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   It's probably the best.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   It's the best, it's better than the big 4.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.220]   And I used to do custom roles on a phone just to have that pure Google experience.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.000]   So the pure Android experience.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.040]   And ever since Google started doing their own photos, you're offering that.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.280]   And does it bug you?
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.040]   I won't ever pay full price again.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.520]   Well, that's, that's what I was going to say.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.160]   Does it bug you how much the everybody now charges?
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.720]   It's like a thousand bucks.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.120]   This table stakes for a phone.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.120]   I was shocked.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.000]   No problem if it's truly worth it.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.640]   If it's something on like the, the build level of a Samsung device, a high-end Samsung
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:02.740]   device with the most epic screen and build quality that's generally right.
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:07.020]   But on the other hand, I prefer the integrated features that the Pixel phone actually has
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.020]   in terms of the assistant use.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.940]   And again, I'll go back to having just basic stuff built in like a good VPN service, even
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.660]   though I use a third party.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.940]   Google actually has one built into their Pixel phones.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.740]   That's pretty damn nice actually.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.420]   And, and I'll just go back.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.260]   Their customer service has been nothing but absolutely superb.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.260]   And I never have to think about billing.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.100]   It's just like, I can't really screw it up.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.100]   And it's about perfectly.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.700]   But you can use that on any phone though, right?
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.320]   Like you could take a Google Fi SIM and use it on say a Samsung phone.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.840]   That would be, that would be just fine.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.840]   So the only thing I think you miss out on would be things like doing, if you even use
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.200]   the feature having your email or your voice messages read to you or something or the text
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.800]   translation of them.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:54.400]   That it also requires Google hardware to or the Moto, I think G6 does it, but to switch
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.840]   between T-Mobile Sprint and US Cellular.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.040]   That was remember that was the big thing that fine.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.480]   Was that what it was?
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.520]   Google's new dialer as well with the integrated support for blocking spam calls or the assistant
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.640]   just answering calls for me and then give me a summary of what the hell it was.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.120]   I absolutely love that.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.560]   So that's not fly specific.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.760]   That's Google specific.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   That's on the.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   Either way.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.680]   Here's the thing guys like I got to tell you all this stuff is so awesome.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.600]   I agree that Google does so many amazing things, especially on the AI side.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.120]   It's just it's way better than anything Siri can do.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.280]   The issue is messaging.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.680]   Messaging is so broken on the Google side.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.160]   Oh, it drives me crazy.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.200]   Now they've taken the words.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.760]   Now it's Google Meet and Google Chat on the G Suite.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.520]   They took the word Hangouts out, which makes me really worry because Hangouts is the only
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.400]   cross platform messaging solution.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.040]   So that's what I use on Fi.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.400]   Are you signal for everything?
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.400]   Signal.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   Signal.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.560]   You can't make signal to your default SMS app on Android anymore.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.560]   Can you?
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   You can.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.560]   And iOS.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.560]   Oh, you can't do it.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   You can't.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   I've been using WhatsApp.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.560]   You can't.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.200]   I was calling on iOS when you started getting your messages from my success.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.160]   I should fire it up and just don't know.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   No, no, no.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.160]   iOS you have to use Apple's messages.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.160]   You can't signal.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   That's right.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.160]   For SMS, right?
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.000]   You can use it on Apple.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.400]   Here's why I don't use signal.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   I remember now.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.480]   It's tied to a phone number.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.160]   So for a normal person, that's fine.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.720]   But if you have if you're like Kevin and maybe me and you have more than one phone, it's
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.720]   no good.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.480]   You got your burner phone, Leo.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.480]   You just didn't.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.840]   This is like you, the one on my bedside table.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.840]   Most of the time.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.920]   I keep my old school Google voice account around just for having that burner number and
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:51.200]   an account and a texting system that, you know what, I'll give that out to the public.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.200]   So you can.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.200]   Okay.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.560]   So if I use the Google voice number, then I could put signal on every phone and just
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.960]   say, oh, it's this number.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   This is its number.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.080]   I don't think did that work?
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.040]   I have a separate number for both.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   I have my old.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.040]   That's it.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.040]   So you have two signal accounts.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.040]   That's the problem.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   You have one for each phone number.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.560]   I only use signal.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.440]   You can only do it to your main numbers.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   That's what I mean.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.040]   That's the problem.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:19.320]   If signal, look, what we just need, Apple messages with Android support.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.960]   We need something that works on iOS and Android.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:22.960]   Totally.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.920]   That has a desktop client that's not tied to a phone number.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.400]   Frankly, that to me is a privacy issue with signal.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:34.520]   I don't know why they do that because I know they've published a couple of documents recently
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.520]   outlining how they're aware of that very condition and how it is an issue for a lot
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.520]   of people to join up.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.800]   And it is something I know they want to attach it to a number and they have a way they've
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   come up with it.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.280]   It might actually work, but they needed to get it implemented.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.920]   And right now, I think they're more concerned about that new trust act or whatever the
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.240]   hell it was that was looking to circumvent and to end the encryption.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.480]   Oh, the Earned Act?
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.840]   That's a convoluted name.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   That's why.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:05.400]   Earned is more clever than I thought I could give Congress credit for because Congress
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.720]   and the Department of Justice and every government in the world is but trying to eliminate end
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.720]   to end encryption.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.480]   Their position is, oh, no, law enforcement needs to be able to know everything you're
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:18.840]   doing or we can't stop child pornography or terrorists or whatever the offensive flavor
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.280]   of the month is.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:25.960]   But the problem is, at least in the US, they've done it in Russia, they've done it in Australia,
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.040]   they've done it in Sweden, they've done it in many countries where they just say, no,
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.960]   you can't have end to end encryption.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:37.200]   It's up to the signal or whoever, you're going to make a plain text version available law
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.520]   enforcement if they ask for it.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.040]   They can't do it in the US because people like us will get up in arms so they thought they
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.040]   were clever.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.600]   Oh, we got it.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.080]   I know.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:53.840]   We'll threaten to withhold Section 230 protections, the ones that say you're not responsible for
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.920]   the content on your website or your blog, the comments on your blog or the videos on
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.840]   YouTube.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:05.120]   You can't go to jail or be sued for those because you're just a carrier, but they say
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:13.160]   if that protection, you have to earn it by, yeah, you've got to earn it by following
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:20.120]   quote best practices in terms of encryption or just in terms of offering best practices,
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.920]   but what they're really talking about is encryption.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.800]   And who is the final arbiter of best practices?
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   Sure, they've created a committee, but it's all deferential to the attorney general in
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.960]   the United States of America, one William Barr who thinks encryption is the worst thing
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.320]   that ever happened.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:40.120]   So it's a say in Feinstein and Diane Feinstein, who is one of the sponsors of the Internet.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:44.440]   So Dick Blumenthal, another sponsor said, it's not about encryption.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.360]   We just don't want child pornography.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.440]   What companies to be responsible?
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:53.480]   They have to earn their section 230 protection, but it is about encryption.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:58.200]   The funny thing is Dick Blumenthal is going on and on about how you got to use encryption
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.800]   and then he's got sponsoring this stupid act.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   It's very offensive.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:09.640]   Yeah, it's just it's it's so they don't realize that this is a whack-a-mole game.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.560]   Encryption is never going away, right?
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.640]   So you shut it down on messaging and guess what?
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.360]   You just take a file, a text file, encrypt it, put it on a drop box and share it with
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   someone else.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.800]   You go back and forth and you just keep doing that.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.000]   It's like, it's so ridiculous.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.040]   It's just people are going to find ways around this.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.120]   Have you ever used, I love magic wormhole.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.960]   Do you know about that?
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:32.720]   The problem with using drop boxes, drop box has a copy.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.640]   Of course, it's encrypted, but it's there and there, you know, maybe that sets up a
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.200]   red flag or something.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.720]   Magic wormholes point to point.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:47.840]   So if I want to send Patrick a secret plan to dominate the world, I would use magic wormhole
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:53.600]   to encrypt it and it would give me, you know, an English passphrase, you know, nasal walnut,
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.000]   glow nasal walnut.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.760]   And then I would call Patrick, say, glow nasal walnut and hang up and then Patrick will fire
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:05.560]   up his magic wormhole type and glow nasal walnut and it would do a peer to peer connection.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.560]   And so no third part.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.560]   Well, I guess the phone company know about it.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.440]   Yeah, BitTorrent had something like that too recently, right?
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.880]   Is it something they did that was encrypted like that?
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.120]   The problem with BitTorrent, say, it's put that off to Brazilian.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   Resilio is they never, they never talked about the, they never, it's not open source.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.400]   They never revealed the protocol.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.400]   So it seems like a good idea.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.080]   Yeah, you'd have a unique identifier.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:35.280]   Anyway, what are we talking about Google Fi?
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.120]   And the iPhone.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:43.440]   So I hope this doesn't depress you, Kevin, but John Prosser, who by the way, I don't,
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.120]   I don't know who this guy is, but he's been leaking on Twitter and he had every detail
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.480]   of the iPhone SE, including the name before anybody else did.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.400]   He even said the release date would be Wednesday.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:48:01.400]   Just tweeted a couple of days ago, should have some iPhone SE plus news for you soon.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.560]   That's really odd.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.560]   There's another one coming.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.720]   Is it the larger version?
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.720]   I guess.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.720]   Yeah, it's the larger version.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.800]   But people are unhappy about how large this one is.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   It's 4.7.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   Oh my God.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.960]   The naming conventions of the iPhones are so confusing.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.720]   Well, anyway.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   I think I'm going to get one.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:27.000]   I think is, is, you know, get the XR or the XR plus.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   I love the XR.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   I love the XR.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.200]   Wasn't that a nice phone?
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.760]   But what's the difference between a like a SE plus and XR?
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   I don't know.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   Yeah, you're confusing me.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.680]   I'm confused.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.920]   I think men mobile.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.200]   Are they going to still send me a, Lisa?
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.520]   Are they going to still send me an iPhone SE?
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.520]   Mitt mobile.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.840]   I just want like iPhone 14, small, medium, large.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:52.840]   That'd be so great.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.840]   That'd be so good.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.520]   And then we all understand everything that's going on.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.880]   Big screen, little screen, tiny screen.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.000]   How about the magic keyboard?
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.680]   That Apple also said that's going to be available a little early.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.480]   They said, "May, it's now going to be available this week," the 24th.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.080]   I've got that coming.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.600]   Of course you do.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:19.760]   Well, I've, listen, I'm telling you the iPad with the mouse combo is really fantastic.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   I agree.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.120]   I've been using it like that.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.880]   And it is so great to finally see some innovation on the mouse side.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.920]   Like how the mouse turns into the object it's touching.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   I love that.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:31.920]   It's really cool.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.080]   That's brilliant because then you know what you're doing.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.560]   It turns into the button.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.560]   You know that's a button.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.920]   I'm going to click it if I click that button.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.640]   I think I agree with you.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:47.960]   And I've felt for a long time the 12.9 inch iPad is amazing hardware that somehow, there's
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.080]   just software that just isn't living up to the promise.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.760]   This is a laptop.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.720]   So they're finally putting a laptop keyboard.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.440]   It's the same keyboard as on their MacBook Air and the 16 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.520]   They're putting it on a hinge so it's kind of a little bit more.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.960]   It's even got a charging plug on the side.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.760]   This is, turns it into a laptop.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.760]   Bring 150 dollars.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.280]   This is just so much money for what it is.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:14.360]   It costs as much as an iPhone as e.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:20.880]   Yeah, no, but I really think I was excited when they announced this because it felt to
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:26.440]   me like Apple finally said, yes, we are going to turn the iPad into your next laptop.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.680]   And this is how we're going to do it.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:33.600]   It gets more bridging the code they need to start pulling all of the basically eliminating
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.440]   the Intel processors from the laptop lineup over the next couple of years.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.920]   Do you think you're going to do that?
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:42.680]   After they announced this, I thought, oh, they don't need to because the laptops are
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:47.280]   the trucks, as Steve Jobs famously said, and the desktops are the trucks.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:52.360]   Therefore the people are doing coding, video editing, launching rocket ships.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.680]   The iPads, the computer, everybody else will want, normal people will want.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:01.320]   And then we don't have to, we can keep Intel because they really need the horsepower, frankly.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:07.000]   So they can keep Intel in the trucks and then they and then arm for everything else.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.240]   You think they're going to put arm on the trucks?
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:13.360]   I think they're going to try to, they'll probably start with the errors and work their way up
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.360]   from there.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.680]   And it's going to be interesting to see.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:24.200]   It's been kind of crazy watching the new processors from AMD, have a desktop or should
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:28.680]   be on the laptop and the performance on those for what you're paying is spectacular.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.960]   Because, you know, where you just like, oh, this is like the desktop story.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.200]   Put it on a laptop and all I, you know, it's because we were looking at a special peak
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.640]   from PC Perin and I were talking about this earlier this year and we were like, really
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.960]   excited, but we were waiting to see what the battery life looked like.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   And then the battery life, wow, battery life's not looking bad.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:54.520]   So, you know, the, the, they're just, they're just kicking asses at AMD right now.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:00.240]   And Intel has to be, you know, Intel is looking at like a year, two years of reorganizing
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:04.000]   and trying to get back on their pace.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.480]   I mean, they've, you know, they've, they've been off on their process technology for a
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   while.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:14.120]   They just didn't care about power users, particularly because, well, where else they're
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.120]   going to go?
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.480]   We'll give another 5% this year, 10% that year.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.160]   And now all of a sudden AMD is just pushing them hard.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:25.840]   And I think it's, you know, we've been looking at processors and everybody's coming up with
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.920]   custom processors for the phones.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.280]   And I think it's, you know, like Qualcomm's going to be competing not just with Apple,
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.800]   but with, you know, it seems like everybody else in the planet at this point in terms of
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.800]   ARM designs.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.520]   I feel like they're starting to get enough power out of ARM where they're going to sort
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.680]   of take over the low end Intel processors and be able to do things that kind of customize
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.120]   it to run their code better.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.120]   We'll see in a couple of years.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:52.120]   You know, speaking of AMD, did you see that they are now powering the next generation PS5s
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.920]   and the next generation Xbox as well?
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.920]   Yeah, both of them.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   Yeah, that's huge.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.880]   It's the GPU in the CPU in that, isn't it?
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.880]   That's right.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:00.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.880]   I think they're both sides.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:02.880]   That's crazy.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.040]   And they're finally going to catch up on ray tracing, which Nvidia zoned for the past year.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:11.800]   I think it was the, I think it was those console processors that gave them the money to sit
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.400]   down and kind of, you know, blow up the architecture and start over from scratch on the desktop
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   side.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:22.680]   Here's something we would have been shocked to be talking about 15 years ago.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.680]   They've nanometer processes.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.760]   AMD is doing it.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.320]   Arms doing it.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.320]   Who would have thought?
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:38.120]   In fact, I seem to remember that you have quantum tunneling problems of seven nanometers.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   I don't know how they're doing five nanometers.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.960]   You know, it's crazy as AMD isn't even doing it.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.960]   They're not.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   The one's actually many things.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.920]   Well, that's what would be crazy is the idea that Intel would lose the lead in process
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.520]   technology and TSMC would bypass them.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:58.240]   I mean, that's the thing that's kind of like, whoa, what happened in tell?
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.680]   What did happen in Intel?
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.000]   What the hell happened in Intel?
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.960]   They couldn't even get to 10 nanometers.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.960]   I should go check.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.960]   They're right around the corner.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   They're in Oregon.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.960]   That's right.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:10.960]   I'll go.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:11.960]   Good knock on the actually close.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.960]   Close.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:13.960]   It closed.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.360]   That really is an interesting thing to me.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:26.680]   I feel like do you think we are now at the literal limits for Moore's law?
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.840]   I mean, five nanometers.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.080]   It'll go to light next.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:37.200]   Photonic processing will be the next one avenue of making everything go even faster than
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:42.680]   it is today with no end in sight for that, especially for specific compute projects too.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.360]   I mean, Intel is already experimenting with that.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.760]   Hopefully, it'd be nice to see a natural project or a product.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:54.520]   But for right now, if I'm building a new box for myself as a workstation, AMD, I'm not
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.400]   even, I'm not looking at Intel.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.440]   So I have not said that in probably like 15 years.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.240]   I can't even recall the last time I thought this.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.240]   It was exactly.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:08.640]   Remember at the screen savers, we were rooting for AMD because they were sticking it to Intel
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.720]   and they were keeping the overall processor prices down and they were really improving
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.000]   efficiency and it made Intel step up.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.760]   And for a while AMD was on the rocks and now they're back again.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.760]   It's a fun battle.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.880]   It's been a battle for a long time.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:37.440]   I bought an AMD 486 DX 280, which was a 40 core base with a two multiplier because it
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.320]   was so much cheaper than the Intel's.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.680]   And I was like, I was really happy with the purchase.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.640]   I saved like $75 or $100 in the processor.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.960]   Were you playing Halo on that?
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.520]   Is that what your Halo machine was?
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.240]   This was a long time ago.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.160]   I don't even know if Halo was around.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.160]   Oh, wasn't Halo.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.920]   What was that game you guys were playing?
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   Counter strike.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.760]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.320]   I was building Windows 3.11 for work groups is what I was doing.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.440]   Yeah, I remember we were at the LAN party and the screen savers.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.400]   It was bungees, but it was a predecessor to Halo.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   Marathon.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.920]   You were playing marathon on it.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.720]   I think I was I think I was playing back then like Wolf 3D.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.240]   Oh, or unreal tournament.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.680]   Somebody said unreal tournament maybe.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.800]   I remember we were playing Quake 3.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.280]   We were playing that, right?
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.280]   Team Arena.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.280]   Team Arena.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:28.280]   And you guys would like blow me up all the time.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.680]   It's always a fun feeling.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.400]   What was that thing Prager did?
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:37.240]   He was like you had a circle of rocket guns and you were making you're making like a
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   people bouncing the air or something.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.280]   Oh, you could turn on the mods, right?
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.560]   So you'd like zero gravity mods and all those.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:50.760]   The LAN party was a lot of fun, but I felt like Carson later told me at the pre pre tech
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:55.720]   TV back when we were doing the site that because they were playing that's when they're
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:01.880]   playing marathon maybe because it was all on max that they were told to gang up on me.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   So management said that Leo's a dick.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.880]   Go get him.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   Carson, right?
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   Am I kidding?
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.680]   Am I making that up?
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.680]   Maybe Carson's making that up.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.800]   I find that I find that very hostile.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:21.680]   We are reliving the golden years with our good golden friends.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:26.080]   Kevin Rose, who is now at True Ventures.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.080]   Are you Angel?
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.760]   Or is it just one of the partners around?
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.760]   What do you do?
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.040]   We do seed in series A.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.680]   So very, very early.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   That's cool.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:42.040]   You get to see these guys when they're first starting up and help them along the way.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.760]   It's my favorite part of a business.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:50.160]   It's like one or two people just getting together the initial idea.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.400]   Sometimes they have mock up.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.640]   Sometimes they have prototypes and it's so much fun to see what you think is going to
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.360]   be something massive, but it's going to take a few years.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.600]   So it's bleeding edge stuff, which is I've always enjoyed.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.600]   So you went.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:07.720]   So as an entrepreneur, you created Dig and I remember you were on the cover of Business
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:14.160]   Week as the $60 million man, which you quickly told us was not anywhere near the truth.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:18.160]   That was just a made up cover by Business Week.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:24.120]   But you exited that after I convinced you to create Dig 4.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.120]   That's right.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.120]   That was all your fault.
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.120]   It was my fault.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.280]   In fact, I have a t-shirt that says Dig 4 was my idea.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.280]   Amazing.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.440]   If you want to take that blame, I'm happy to pass it on to you.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.280]   I will take the blame because I remember telling you, you know, the only thing missing
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:46.160]   on Dig is you should let the users.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:51.320]   I can't remember what it was, but it was something that really was a bad idea.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.880]   It was not your fault, but you had nothing to do with it.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:57.280]   You didn't listen to me then either.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   All right.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:06.280]   But it's kind of unfortunate because after Dig was very successful, this guy named Alexis
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:10.440]   O'Haney and Steve Huffman came along and said, "Oh, we should do something like that.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.800]   We'll call it Reddit."
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:19.000]   And Dig passed away because everybody gamed Dig and man, you had massive gaming issues,
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   which was really unfair.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   Massive.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   That was a tough one.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   That was just hit it hard.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.880]   But somehow Reddit avoided that and they got all the glory when you really deserved it because
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.480]   it was your idea and they just made a clone, frankly.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:38.200]   It's like, you know, these things are all, every idea practically that I see launched
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:42.440]   is some type of modification or iteration on somebody else's thinking.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:48.200]   So I don't really look, I actually don't look back on the Reddit team as being, I think it's
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.920]   a great, actually I have read it on my phone.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.920]   I use it.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   Me too.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   Some of the some of the some of the some of the some Reddit's are fantastic.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.800]   Oh, I love it.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.000]   It's my only social network, really.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.920]   And I know I've interviewed Steve and Alexis.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.880]   Alexis is now like a movie star because he married Serena Williams.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:09.720]   So, but it's, you know what, they were just one of us and they, you know, Steve wrote
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.200]   it in lisp for crying out loud.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.280]   The first first version of Reddit, which is amazing.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:21.160]   Alexis is going, "Oh, we thought this was a terrible idea."
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:26.320]   And so then after Dig, what did you do?
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.160]   Was that when you started Milker, you were doing revision three, you were doing Ignatian?
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.400]   Yeah, revision three, Ignatian.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.040]   I started dabbling in angel investing back then.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040]   It was a really good time.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.760]   You found a little company called, I remember you told me about it.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.560]   I don't know what had happened to Twitter.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.560]   I think it was.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:47.360]   Yeah, Twitter was, was well, I was very lucky in that when you're in the Bay Area in 2004
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.560]   and you're beginning a Web 2.0.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.520]   You know, you get to know all these other founders.
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:57.760]   So that was very fortunate that I got to invest in some of those companies.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.680]   Early stage Twitter money.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.560]   And do you still do wrist watches?
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.880]   Because the last time I saw you, I think we were at the French Laundry with a bunch of
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.080]   other people for a wristwatch company.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.080]   I can't remember with.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080]   Yeah, Houdinkey.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.960]   Houdinkey is still on the board there.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960]   Houdinkey, yeah.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.160]   They're based out of New York.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:19.520]   And so I haven't seen them in a while, but I will get out there at some point.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.080]   But do you still do watches or you moved on to another fetish?
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.360]   I'm an Apple.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.840]   I'm a quantified self.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.400]   You're an Apple Watch guy.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.280]   After all those fancy expensive Swiss watches.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.560]   Well, so here's the delay.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:38.160]   I can appreciate the dying art and craftsmanship that goes into some of that stuff.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160]   It's amazing.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.160]   Dying.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:46.960]   I mean, you go to Japan and you meet some of these really small independent watchmakers.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:53.680]   Yeah, they spend six months making a single watch and it's an amazing thing to witness.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.840]   But it is a very specialized limited thing.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:04.320]   And actually, the Apple Watch has pretty much put Swiss watchmakers out of business, I think.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.800]   It happened a little before.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800]   Did it?
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.800]   They were the I&R watch.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.520]   That would be the quartz movement, I think, was kind of the kick of the teeth on that
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.520]   one.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.520]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.240]   A $50 watch that was more accurate than that watch that took a year to build.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.200]   Yeah, I was going to say there's probably more.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.880]   I was going to say there's probably more interest now for mechanical watches today than there
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:31.200]   was even like 10 or 15 years ago, just in terms of whether or not I doubt they're any
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.560]   more affordable, but for especially for a good one.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.400]   Oh, they're, I mean, some of them are hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.680]   They're really works of art.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.920]   They're works of art.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.200]   Yeah, which I can admire from a distance.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.400]   Let's take a little break.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.840]   We'll talk more with Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, Robert Herron.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.240]   We'll catch up with all three of them in just a little bit our show today brought to you
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.360]   by IT Pro TV, our 50th anniversary.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.120]   IT Pro TV is not quite as old, but they were based in the same notion.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:07.760]   In fact, I remember that Tim and Don, the founders, they were IT trainers.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.760]   They came to a little panel.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.040]   We did it at NAB some years ago.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.720]   We talked about what we had done with Twit.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.920]   They said, boy, be interested to do something like that around IT training and IT Pro TV
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:18.920]   was born.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.400]   They have absolutely surpassed us.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.920]   Now in Gainesville, they have, I think, five or six live studios are beautiful.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:35.600]   They are doing hundreds of hours a week of IT training, 4,000 hours on demand.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.480]   And one of the reasons they keep those studios running all the time is because they want
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.560]   to keep them up to date.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.880]   It's part of their core values.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.480]   And it's important if you're thinking about an IT training, you got to train for the latest
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   exams.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.760]   You got to use the latest software.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.040]   There's new certs all the time.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.400]   There's interfaces are redesigned.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.200]   You can't use the old stuff.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.280]   So IT Pro TV makes a point of having the latest, greatest IT training.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.320]   And I got to tell you, it's engaging.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   It's entertaining.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.320]   It's fun.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.080]   Binge-worthy learning for IT professionals.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.560]   So you're wanting to get a job in IT or keep that job going.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.480]   Look at that set.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.480]   That looks like the old screensaver set.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.480]   It's gorgeous.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.240]   They really cool set, isn't it?
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.280]   They have one has an Ella frickin' invader.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   An elevator.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.120]   I'm so mad.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.560]   Then they also did something really smart.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.640]   They have a central control station in the middle and then the studios are all around
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.640]   it.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.640]   So it's very flexible.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:39.160]   In fact, they also do just side light right now with a lot of companies trying to take
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:47.560]   conferences and training offline or online, I should say, instead of in real space.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.040]   They also are helping people do that too so you can contact them if you're interested
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.040]   in that.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.440]   If you want to cancel or you had to cancel your upcoming conference, they can actually
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.640]   do virtual conferences.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.880]   Either in their studio or use their expertise to come to you and have you set it up.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.120]   So IT Pro TV is great to keep in mind for that too.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:11.120]   4,000 hours of IT training, they're the official video training partner for CompTIA.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.680]   Those CompTIA search are the base search for anybody who wants to get into IT, whether
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.080]   it's A+ or Network Plus or Security Plus search.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.680]   They have 12, in fact, CompTIA on demand courses.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.400]   I'm an A+ certified technician.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.040]   And you're proud of it, right?
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040]   Aren't you proud of that?
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.880]   Got that back in 1995.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.720]   That was for desktop support, right?
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.720]   I mean, that's it.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.320]   In fact, that's how you started a tech TV.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.080]   You were our support guy, right?
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.080]   That's right.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.080]   Wow.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.080]   You still call me up.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.080]   I'm still defragging your heart.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.080]   Yeah, it's a heck of a deal.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.120]   I can't figure it out.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.120]   Help me.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.120]   ITPro.tv/twit.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.200]   Be like Kevin Rose.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   Get your A+ certificate.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.680]   It's a little harder than it was in 1995, but ITProTV is there to help you.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:59.760]   Right now, if you go to ITPro.tv/twit and you use your offer code Twit30, you'll get
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:05.240]   30% off and not just for the first month or year, but for as long as you stay active.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.840]   That's an incredible savings.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.840]   I want you to take advantage of that.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.040]   You're going to love it.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:15.840]   Even if you don't do this professionally, if you're geek enough to watch what we're doing,
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.720]   you're geek enough for ITProTV.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.800]   ITPro.tv/twit.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.880]   Offer code Twit30, ITProTV.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:27.120]   Build or expand your IT career and enjoy the journey.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:31.360]   These are great guys doing some really high and wonderful content that's helping people
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.080]   get fantastic jobs.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.760]   This is a good time maybe to get a tough job at IT.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.880]   Yeah, that A+ helped me land a couple jobs actually, one of the Nevada test sites and
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.240]   at Tech TV.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:50.640]   If you know this stuff, but you can't prove you know it, the cert is the way you get in
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   the door.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.200]   Then you have experience and you can say, "I got the experience," and you can keep going
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.200]   from there.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.840]   Often that first entry level job, without a cert, they don't know.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.720]   I still remember some of my questions from the test.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:03.720]   Do you give us one?
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.280]   See if we can answer it.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.680]   Okay, any of you can get this.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.960]   This will be a good one.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:13.600]   What IRQ was COMPORT 2 on by default?
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.600]   Oh!
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.040]   I know the answer to this in my head.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.840]   Was it odd even or even odd?
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.880]   I want to say IRQ 13, but COMPORT…
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.120]   No, no, it's lower than that.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.760]   I'm going to say IRQ…
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.760]   Don't look at the chat room.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.760]   No, I'm not.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.760]   I'm going to say one.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.760]   Is it one?
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.760]   No.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   Two.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.760]   Two.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.760]   That's easy.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.760]   IRQ 2 is port…
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:42.120]   I was so happy when those modems started doing IRQ.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.440]   I used to know all that stuff.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.440]   Remember IRQ conflicts?
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.520]   Oh, that's what I'm saying.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.520]   When they started doing auto-IRQ…
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.520]   Because they shared.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.520]   I was like, "Where's the worst guy?"
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.800]   Two ports shared the same IRQ in a wrapper question.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.800]   And then you're going to take a little jumper out and then move over.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.800]   Oh my God!
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800]   Such a nightmare.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.800]   It was the worst.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.080]   That chat room knew…
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.080]   I think the chat room knew.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.880]   Oh no, they said IRQ 5.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:08.880]   That's the sound card.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.600]   Yeah, get it right, guys.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.440]   Come on.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.000]   Talk about worthless knowledge today, right?
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.200]   We don't have serial ports anymore.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.040]   Or is it a couple of really old computers that it's good to at least know where to find
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.320]   that info for when you… if you want to try to get them working again.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.360]   So there's a huge movement for playing vintage video.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:37.400]   And when I say vintage, I mean, except from the 80s, 90s, you know, the early aughts now
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.400]   where people are assembling…
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.960]   Lazy Gamer Review on YouTube.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.240]   LGR, look that up.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.920]   It's… the guy's been doing it a while.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.920]   Awesome channel.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.920]   There's a lot of channels out there like that.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.920]   But LGR on YouTube is just one of those kind of channels where it's just pretty much dedicated
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.240]   to the older stuff.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.320]   I downloaded the Leisure Suit Larry, the first one.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.320]   Yes.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.240]   And I was like, "Oh my God, what is this?"
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.280]   Like I had no other stuff like that opening.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.800]   So horny, man.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   We had…
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   What was his name?
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.800]   Al.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.880]   I can't remember his last name.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880]   We had him on the show.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   What was his name?
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880]   Al something.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   The creator of Leisure Suit Larry.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.480]   I want to say Al Laffer.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480]   He's…
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.480]   That's not the right name.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:18.320]   Like I don't want to say he's dead.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.320]   But I feel…
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.320]   Larry…
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320]   No.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.960]   Oh, Larry Laffer was Leisure Suit Larry's last name.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.760]   Yeah, he was called Larry Laffer.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.760]   It was…
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:29.760]   Oh.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.760]   Al Lowe.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.280]   Al Lowe, he's 73 years old.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.520]   And I think…
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.560]   I think he's still doing it.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:40.560]   I think he…
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:45.160]   I feel like I read that he just released an update to this.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.480]   Leisure Suit Larry Land of the Lounge Lizards was originally came out in 1987.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:50.480]   1987.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.480]   The remake in '91.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.680]   And kickstart out of 2013 remake.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.360]   Yeah, and in 2018 Leisure Suit Larry, wet dreams don't dry.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.320]   Give…
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.120]   Give you some idea of the kind of humor.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120]   Al was a great guy though.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.120]   I loved Al Lowe.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.920]   He was a hoot and a hat.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.440]   I cut you kind of missed that.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.760]   I missed the old days.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.960]   But I missed the people because it was a different…
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.960]   Now it's very corporate.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.480]   And you deal Kevin with all the startup guys.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.480]   But I liked the old days when a…
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.160]   Software came in a Ziploc bag with a Xeroxed construction.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.120]   And the people wrote it were people more like us.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.880]   Yeah, back…
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.680]   The BBS days is what I…
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.600]   Yeah, the BBS days.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.600]   Exactly.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:44.120]   So I'm like having bad flashbacks to getting Fido net to run.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.120]   Yeah, like…
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.120]   Fido net was impossible.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.000]   Were we all Fido net sisops?
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   Yes.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.440]   I shared a house with a Fido net sisops.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.640]   So I didn't have to become a Fido net sisops.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   But it was just…
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.560]   You know, part of me is like I have nostalgia.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.920]   But so much of what you can do now is so much easier.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:03.920]   Oh yeah.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.920]   You know, I don't know.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.920]   I'm torn, you know.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.920]   I…
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.920]   You find…
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.200]   I had 1984 or '85 set up one of the first Mac BBSs.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.880]   It was a Fido net.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880]   It was in San Francisco.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.360]   Tom Jennings was in San Francisco, the creator of Fido net.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.560]   So I used to talk to him from time to time.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.960]   And yeah, it was very different now.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.960]   It's much easier.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.200]   But it's some sort of easier Patrick.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.160]   It's sort of harder too though, don't you think?
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.440]   I don't know.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.440]   It's different.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.600]   There's a lot more.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.600]   There's a lot more.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.960]   In those days, if you knew the interrupts…
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.440]   You know, you only had one or two hard drive models, right?
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.960]   At this point, it's also…
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:50.200]   It's amazing how many things are just completely unfixable by an end user.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.200]   Oh, exactly.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.560]   Where if it doesn't work, it's probably impossible for you to get it fixed without
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.400]   accessing some level 2, level 3 tech.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.400]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.200]   But it's also…
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.200]   I don't know.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.200]   I like laughing because I think like, you know, operating system updates used to be
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.200]   a big deal.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.640]   And now we have Windows as a service, which on some days I adore.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.480]   And in other days when like, I remember, you know, my system rebooting right before
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:25.080]   recording a podcast and discovering that it had wiped out the drivers for my camera,
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.560]   my focus right, and the keyboard.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.360]   But here…
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.920]   Okay, here's a story that just came out that I think illustrates how difficult it is
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.920]   for end users.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.080]   This is right up your alley, Patrick.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:45.000]   It turns out that a lot of the big NAS drives being sold by Western Digital, Seagate, and
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.080]   others are using a technique called SMR, shingled media recording, or shingled…
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.120]   I'm sorry, shingled magnetic recording.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.120]   And there is a real flaw in SMR.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.280]   It's slow.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.120]   It's really slow.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.280]   It gives you higher densities because it's like a roof shingle.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:09.400]   It's layering the data on the same data on multiple…
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:16.200]   I'm sorry, different data on the same track and it really can slow you down.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:21.040]   It's not the kind of most hard drives or CMR conventional magnetic recording.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:28.040]   But the problem is there's no way of knowing if this NAS drive you bought is an SMR drive
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.600]   and as a result unsuitable for use on an S.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:37.280]   Well, I mean, the simplest way is just you buy the purples or the reds.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280]   No.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.280]   No, the Western Digital Reds are shingled.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.320]   At least some of them.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.640]   That's infuriating.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:50.720]   I've started using Seagate drives of late for all of my hard drive needs.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.840]   I had ran into a couple issues with some Western Digital drives and I used them in NAS boxes
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.840]   for surveillance systems that are constantly writing.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.440]   Not a lot of read performance really.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.360]   I don't really need that side of it, but it is writing 99.9% of the time to a bunch of
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.360]   drives.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.480]   Most people, especially once you start getting into systems that are at least eight drives
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:15.400]   or more, then vibrations become an issue and that's really the case and the drives themselves
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.360]   have to be rated properly.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:21.480]   We were just talking about the good old days with operating systems.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:28.200]   I think one of the big transitions was just this multitasking environment we're in now.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:33.840]   It really just kind of used to be back in the day we ran one app at a time at full speed.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.200]   If you want to close that app and do something else, so be it.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.280]   But that seems to have opened the means for a lot of people just to get themselves in
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.280]   trouble.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.080]   Like you accidentally clicked the wrong email link while doing something else and it'll
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.240]   wipe out a wipe out a system or make your life uncomfortable.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:50.040]   Well, there's certainly are very bad actors out there.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.480]   Do you think Kevin's the dark tipper?
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.480]   He always hated it.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   I like to rub it in though.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.480]   I do.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:01.040]   Do you think it's different now that hacking today is different?
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.720]   I mean, you did system.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.560]   You did a lot of hacking stuff.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.960]   All of it benign, all of it white hat.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.520]   Do you think the bad guys have gotten worse?
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:17.120]   I mean, the thing is I am certainly a little bit more paranoid than I used to be about
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.120]   everything.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.960]   I just assume if I'm putting anything online, it's going to get out there.
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:27.760]   And I treat my own home security quite differently than I have in the past.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.120]   But I'm not familiar with the latest and greatest tools that are going on that are
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.520]   going to be a dark tip.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.840]   You couldn't do a dark tip or show these days.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.920]   Not these days now.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.360]   You're all grown up.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.760]   That's right.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.080]   I couldn't either for that matter.
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.680]   Although for that we have people like Father Robert and we bring in other people go to
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.840]   Defcon and Black Hat.
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:48.840]   I don't know.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.000]   I don't think there'll be a Defcon or Black Hat.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   The priests, man.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   The priests are good at those.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   The priests are dark.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   Gary good.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.320]   They've been in the dark arts for centuries.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.920]   They know.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:04.040]   So quick update to the SMR.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.200]   Toshiba Seagate are also Toshiba Seagate.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.200]   Everybody's doing it.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.200]   Yeah, shipping SMR drives.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.880]   It's cheaper because they can do more data with fewer platters.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:18.200]   And at first, if you read the R's technical article, at first, Western Digital said, "Oh,
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.520]   no, no, we're not doing that."
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.520]   No, okay.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.440]   We did it on OneDrive, which never made it to the consumer chain.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.440]   Okay, we are doing it.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.440]   But it was very embarrassing for Western Digital.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.120]   It makes me really think.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:35.080]   I think they're going to get stomped on this one and pull back from it.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:39.440]   I don't think it's something that can really survive if they start wiping out NAS performance.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.440]   Good.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.440]   I could be wrong.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.440]   It's frustrating, right?
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:48.520]   Because so many of the really, there's not a whole lot of sites doing really serious,
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.520]   really serious drive reviews or SSD reviews.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.520]   Not anymore.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:55.520]   Not anymore.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.520]   Yeah, Alan Malletano is the late, great, now he's at Intel.
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.800]   I look at backblaze a bit.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.440]   Don't they do the storage pods for their own?
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.880]   They're good because they're a backup company.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.520]   And of course, they use a lot of drives.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.720]   In fact, I think they may have been the ones that revealed this SMR scan.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.640]   They publish their aggregated data every year for their failures.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.640]   That's very useful.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.280]   What they buy and how many hours.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.280]   It's pretty good.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:21.680]   It's as detailed as you want to get into.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.320]   Google's done that too in the past.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.880]   Yeah, you want to look at somebody who's got thousands and thousands of drives, tens of
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.880]   thousands of drives.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.840]   Well, you can see an idea of who's reliable, but it also confirmed some cases like, hey,
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.280]   if you spend more money on a helium-based drive, then you're going to actually get a
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.240]   better result.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:41.080]   But they're also part of the thing of doing it backblaze is being like, we can use consumer
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:45.640]   grade hardware and spread things out enough that it becomes significant.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:55.980]   I don't think 15 years ago, we would have thought, oh, yeah, I just bought a 16 terabyte helium
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:59.800]   filled drive for 400 bucks.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.160]   We'd have been like, what?
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.160]   16?
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.160]   No, you mean gigabytes?
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.160]   No, I mean terabytes.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.720]   It's mind-boggling.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.120]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.520]   Mind-boggling.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:16.680]   I don't think anybody anticipated the densities that would go up or that eventually solid
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.920]   state would get almost as inexpensive as spinning media.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:25.640]   Yeah, like one terabyte SSDs for 10 cents a gigabyte.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.640]   It's like, yes.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:31.080]   Yeah, they finally broke that 10 cents barrier.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.720]   And also pushing rewrite speeds to four gigabytes per second.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.720]   Isn't it six?
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720]   Isn't it?
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.720]   Six?
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:38.720]   Is that boggling?
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.720]   It's awesome.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.600]   And he can put it right on the motherboard.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.720]   So he doesn't even need drives.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.200]   Well, that's one thing I think Apple has done very well with that teat.
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.880]   They put the T chute chip in there, which gives you a whole bunch of features included
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:56.640]   security, of course, is their fingerprint reader on the Macbooks or the more modern
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.400]   iMacs and Mac Pros have them.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.840]   But it's also the disc controller.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.280]   So they can put bare, bare nand chips on the motherboard.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.280]   And that's their flat.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.480]   That's their, you can't upgrade it.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.160]   But that's their SSD.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.160]   Pretty remarkable.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.160]   They're very, very fast.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.160]   NVMe drives.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:21.320]   Geez, I bought a two terabyte NVMe drive to put in my XPS 13 for 200 bucks.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320]   Nice.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.960]   It's mind boggling, you know.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.280]   And do you guys all use SSDs now?
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:31.400]   Have you any reason to use a spinning drive for anything?
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:36.520]   If you just want cheap storage and you just don't know.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.520]   My NAS has a spinning drive.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.520]   I'm not going to use an SSD.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:44.120]   Oh, in my workstation, my main drive is an SSD and then I also have equivalent size, like
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:47.400]   a Western digital black drive or something that I've had for a long time.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.360]   That's, you know, the typical setup.
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.360]   Somebody asked me.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.360]   Yeah, the fusion.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.600]   I used the fusion drive, which is the hybrid setup.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.760]   Oh, Kevin, stop.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.760]   Why?
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   What's wrong with that?
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.760]   Oh, Kevin.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.760]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.760]   Oh, don't let it shame you.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.760]   Thank you.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.760]   I have it with these of hard work.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.760]   That's a horrible, terrible.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.760]   Oh, my iMac.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.520]   None of my like, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.440]   Because you'll think it's a brand name for Apple came up with for this hybrid solution
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.160]   Intel didn't, too.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.160]   They're terrible.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.160]   That's why not.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:18.160]   Well, it gives you the speed of the SSD to boot it.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160]   No, it doesn't.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   Even close.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.000]   But it has a little more seed.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.640]   It has a very small SSD and a big spinning drive and then it tries to figure out, oh,
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.640]   he's going to use this again.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.880]   I'll put it on the SSD.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.440]   Are you editing video on that system?
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.840]   Are you working with like multi-characters?
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.840]   I'm just doing photos.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840]   I'm just doing photos.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840]   He's fine, Leo.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.760]   I mean, you can be like, you know, it could be faster if you just spend more money and
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   then move everything over.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.480]   Does Apple still sell them?
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.600]   Does Apple still sell fusion drives?
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.600]   Do they?
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.600]   I mean, I didn't get this Mac that long ago.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.400]   Let me see what year it is.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.400]   This is a 2019 iMac.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.280]   Yeah, no, I'm not a big fan of the fusion.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.800]   I think it's needlessly complex, especially nowadays with it.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:05.840]   It made sense five years ago when SSDs were so expensive.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:08.160]   It's the default drive in the iMac.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.160]   She was funny.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:13.360]   When you're on the iMac, there are only any Apple configuration page.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.360]   It's like, oh, little processor.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.360]   $200.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.360]   Okay, I'll take that.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.360]   It's easy to do.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.120]   And then it's like, RAM, like another $200.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.200]   I was like, oh, gosh, me.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.720]   I probably should.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:26.440]   And then by the time you get to the bottom, I'm like, I'll just take the fusion drive.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.440]   Like it's fine.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.760]   Yeah, I'm going to save a little money.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.760]   I did buy the new Mac book here.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.760]   And it's all right.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.760]   Oops.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   I just closed it.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.680]   It's got a real keyboard, finally.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:44.880]   But why did you get that if you have the new iPad with the mouse coming?
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.920]   Kevin, this is my job.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.920]   That's what I tell Darya.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920]   It's my job.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.280]   I'll have a new piece of hard work coming.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.760]   And she's like, did you really need another laptop?
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.120]   I'm like, I have to read these things.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.200]   I have to have one of this.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.560]   It's just part of what I do.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:08.320]   I hope she's not watching it.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.360]   It's literally the only reason I got in this business.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:20.920]   Because no, I was a DJ and I bought a computer in 1978.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.440]   And I said, Jesus, software is really expensive.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.720]   Oh my God, a floppy drive cost $1,000.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.720]   Oh my God.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.200]   So I said, how can I afford this?
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.520]   I'll write for magazines and they'll send me free stuff.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.800]   That's literally why I got to do this.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.840]   I want to know what's in Robert's box.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:39.960]   Speaking of stuff to review, he's got that like secret box.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.360]   What is in that white box?
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.600]   What is in that white box?
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.240]   It's audio equipment.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.240]   And you definitely wouldn't want us to do it.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.240]   No, I can't.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.240]   Not yet.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.240]   It's embargoed or is it?
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.240]   Yeah, it's not out.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.440]   It's stealing terrible terrible things.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.440]   He tells what brands?
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.440]   No, I don't.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.440]   I'll tell you.
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.440]   But I don't know.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.440]   All right.
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:02.040]   I can probably say the brand.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:06.840]   I'm just going to keep my mouth shut because I sent back the prototype and that's the final
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.000]   shipping one.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   I want to take a break and then I want to talk about audio equipment because we got
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   Robert here.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   We got Patrick here.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.800]   We got Kevin here and I'm curious what you guys use and what you recommend.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.920]   I think it might be.
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:25.080]   This is something nobody talks about anymore.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.080]   Right?
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.080]   Audio.
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.080]   Steve for yourself.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.120]   Well, I know you guys do on AV Excel.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.000]   That's why I want to ask.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.200]   Because I feel like I don't know.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:39.120]   I feel like people don't care anymore.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.640]   Dolby Atmos on that flip.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.000]   That one I don't get.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.840]   Why do you have to have a sound coming from up there?
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.840]   Why do you have to?
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.680]   If you bouncing off the ceiling.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.200]   If you sit through an atmos.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.760]   First of all, you don't want to do bounce.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.760]   You know what?
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.760]   Do your commercial.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.760]   All right.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:57.280]   I'm going to run to the pond and everybody go to the bathroom.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.280]   Go to the bathroom.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.280]   This is your chance.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.280]   Smoke them if you got them and I'm going to do a commercial.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280]   I just sit here.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.720]   Too bad I don't have a catheter.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.720]   And we'll be back.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.640]   We'll talk audio.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.640]   It is so fun.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.920]   See, this is how Twig got started.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.480]   Because I love these guys.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:19.440]   And it's so much fun to talk about tech with other people who have equal passion for
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:20.920]   the subject.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:24.880]   And frankly, we get in the nitty gritty much more than I get to these days.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:28.320]   Robert Herron is here from AV Excel and Herron Fidelity.
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.320]   That's his business.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:34.280]   Patrick Norton was here, but we're getting a beautiful view of the wood paneling and his
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.280]   RV.
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.120]   He's also on AV Excel.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.080]   And former host of this week in Computer Hardware, we'll talk about that when we come
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:45.760]   back because we had to let that one go.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.320]   Kevin Rose is also here.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.360]   Kevin, are you doing a podcast still?
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.720]   I just, I do my Kevin Rose show.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.960]   Whenever you feel like it.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.200]   Yeah, like every few weeks.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.480]   I don't have any sponsors.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.480]   It's nothing crazy.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.480]   It's just something fun I do.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.720]   The chat room is asking that you go out and grind in that rail while we're taking a break.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.560]   Yeah, just take your skateboard out there.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.560]   Get the skateboard out.
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.840]   Yeah, do a little grinding.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.000]   I showed you my wasabi hot cloud storage hot.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000]   Yeah, you'd think it hot like with the wasabi you get with your sushi.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   No, no, no.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.600]   This is sort of like that.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.760]   It's hot cloud storage.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:23.040]   Do you know everybody is moving to the cloud now?
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.040]   I'll give you any.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:28.680]   Speaking to my friend David friend who's the founder of wasabi really great guy.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:29.880]   Love this guy.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:34.000]   And we're talking about how more and more people have realized that they can't do on
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.760]   prem what they want to do.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.240]   They have to go to the cloud.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:44.040]   He talked about a building downtown in Boston, put security cameras up as one does all over
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.040]   the place.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.000]   Those securities cameras are streaming about a megabyte every minute.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.040]   It's actually a mega bit.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.480]   So yeah, it's even more than that.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.880]   It's a lot of data and there's a lot of cameras and all of a sudden they realize if we keep
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:03.040]   buying hard drives, it's going to cost us a mint.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:09.800]   Put it in the cloud in most cases, wasabi is less expensive and more secure than your
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:12.240]   on premises storage.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:15.320]   If you need storage, we all do.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.000]   You need wasabi.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.840]   If you're a managed service provider, you're going to love wasabi because it costs you less.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.600]   That means you can charge less and still earn more money.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.480]   Wasabi uses a patented technology only they have it of writing the disk.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.800]   They write in data in blocks, not sectors and it saves them so much that they're 80%
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.920]   cheaper than Amazon's S3.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.280]   That means they're significantly less expensive even than on prem storage.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:48.640]   In fact, typically you could store data in the cloud with wasabi for less than the annual
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.480]   cost just to the maintenance fees on the on prem storage.
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.080]   Remember how much our sand used to cost.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.400]   I get much more storage for much, much less.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.840]   And wasabi's disruptive price performance model makes buying cloud storage just kind
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.400]   of the natural no-brainer.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.720]   There are two ways to pay.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.800]   You could pay as you go like you would normally.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.920]   And by the way wasabi is about 599 per terabyte per month.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.800]   It's really affordable.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:19.880]   Or you could pay one time with what they call reserved capacity storage.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.560]   This is another way wasabi's really innovating.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.400]   Wasabi's reserved capacity storage makes buying cloud storage a natural addition to
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.920]   your on prem storage.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.280]   If you're thinking about buying more hardware like that building in Boston, compare the price
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.480]   against five years of reserved capacity storage.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:42.040]   And what it'll do is you'll say, and I know sometimes for accounting to convince the boss,
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.760]   "Look, here's the price of this.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.120]   Here's the price of that.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.360]   It's easier to understand.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.360]   It's easier."
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:51.040]   If you purchase cloud storage in one, three, or five year increments, you'll get even greater
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.480]   discounts for term and capacity.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:59.840]   Security is better than on-premises storage, 11 nines of durability, and they do active
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.600]   integrity checking.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.720]   And since there are multiple premier tier four data centers that are highly secure and
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:11.000]   fully redundant, you lose one bit on a file that get another copy from another data center.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.880]   You're golden.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:15.960]   And all wasabi data storage is secure by default.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.480]   It's always encrypted at rest.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.120]   Even if you don't specify encryption, it's just the way it works.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.440]   Encrypted at rest.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:27.160]   And they have very powerful access control mechanisms, bucket policies, ACLs.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.520]   You can even say, "This data is immutable.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.720]   It cannot be erased.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.200]   It cannot be altered.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.200]   It cannot be encrypted by ransomware.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.520]   That data is protected from hackers, from malware.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.040]   It's protected from you."
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.640]   I just think with Sabi does it right.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:48.240]   Been recomply and HIPAA compliance, CJIS compliant.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.240]   Affordable.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:51.240]   They don't, they don't, they're 80% cheaper.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.480]   It's six times faster than S3.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.960]   They don't charge for API access.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.800]   And by the way, they use the S3 API.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.320]   So you already know how to use it.
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.640]   And you already have tools that use it.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:04.920]   They don't charge for egress.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:08.880]   You know, if you look at S3 and all the tiers and all the buckets and all the egress and
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.480]   everything, it's so complicated with Sabi.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.760]   It's very straightforward.
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:15.760]   I don't know why anybody would do anything else.
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.400]   Calculate the savings for yourself.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:18.400]   You can try it right now.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.800]   Free storage for a month.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:24.320]   If you go to wasabi.com, click the link and use the offer code to it.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.400]   This is a good way to really bang on it.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.120]   Take a look at this reserve capacity storage as something new they just introduced.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:33.040]   It is really disrupting the industry.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.080]   I know you probably say, "What?
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.080]   I never heard of them.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.080]   I know Google.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.080]   I know Microsoft.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.080]   I know Amazon.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.080]   You better know wasabi.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.080]   You better.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.080]   It's a better way.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.080]   Join the movement.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.600]   Migrate to the cloud with confidence wasabi.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.760]   W-A-S-A-B-I.com.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.840]   And don't forget the offer code to it.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.000]   These guys are great.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.640]   I know them well.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.520]   I'm really proud to work with them.
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:58.520]   And I'm very happy what they're offering is so superior wasabi.com.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:02.920]   It's kind of, you know, it's an enterprise play, but I also know a lot of individuals
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.480]   are using this for all sorts of interesting things.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.360]   It's just a brilliant way to go.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.360]   Wasabi.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.600]   All right.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.560]   Everybody's back refreshed.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:15.160]   Oh, yeah, baby.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.160]   Tell me.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.840]   That was a dramatization.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.600]   It was very nice.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   Well done.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.840]   Kevin, do you listen to music anymore?
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:28.840]   You're a dad.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.840]   You're young kids.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:30.840]   You do.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:35.320]   I'm a big audio file, more on the kind of vintage vinyl side.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320]   But really?
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.480]   Do you have a turntable and all that?
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.480]   I do.
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:40.480]   I guess you're important.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:41.480]   You have to buy records, right?
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.360]   It's a lot of ladies in the town limits, I think.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.920]   No, CDs are loud.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.280]   Tapes are loud, but yeah.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.040]   And it lays your disc as well.
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.240]   Laser disc, baby.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.640]   Oh, you don't still have a laser disc.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.560]   I'd be jealous if you did.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:59.640]   God, I-- oh, I missed my laser disc because I had, you know, such great stuff on my laser
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:00.640]   disc.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.640]   It looks so cool too.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.440]   When you pulled one out, yeah, the giant CDs or rainbow.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.080]   I think they're about a dollar each on eBay.
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.960]   If you really want the experience stuff.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.160]   Yeah, but who's got the player?
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.160]   Right?
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:16.360]   And then the only bad thing about laser disc is you have to get up and turn it over halfway
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.360]   through the movie.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.360]   Although the fancy--
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.360]   Don't miss that.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:24.120]   The fancy people had the ones that would turn themselves over, I guess.
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.200]   So what do you listen to?
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.960]   What's your stereo setup, Kevin?
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:37.280]   My stereo setup is a friend of mine's dad, manufacturers, these little handmade tube amp,
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.160]   turn table all on ones.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.760]   Yeah, it's called a symbol modern record console.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.760]   Check it out.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:49.160]   It has symbol spelled.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.360]   S-Y-M-B-O-L.
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.400]   Symbol modern record console.
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.280]   And it's a fantastic little setup.
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.760]   And you don't have to worry about anything.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.440]   It's just all in one.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.440]   And then it also has--
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.360]   That's fetish level audio gear.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.360]   No, but it's beautiful.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.360]   It is beautiful.
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.360]   Oh my god.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.360]   But that's $20,000 right there.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:11.640]   Oh my god.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.640]   That's art work.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.720]   So everything-- and look at the tubes.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.920]   Can you tell the difference?
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.760]   They say tubes are warmer.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:21.760]   Yeah, they introduce second order of harmonic that's pleasing to the ear.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:24.440]   And if you enjoy it, man, I don't even want to--
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:28.800]   So it's actually inaccurate because it's adding something.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.280]   A lot of people enjoy it.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.280]   Is it accurate?
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280]   No.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.760]   Inters that have to be accurate?
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:34.760]   No.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:35.760]   Listen to what you like.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.360]   But it's--
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.360]   He builds his mind.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.920]   I mean, these are beautiful.
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:45.960]   It even includes the speakers.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:47.200]   Yeah, it has everything all one.
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.360]   And you can even airplay to it as well.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.240]   It has a little built-in digital component to tie into that.
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.200]   It's awesome.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:53.720]   Oh, wow.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.760]   Do you get decent stereo separation with the speakers
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.800]   that close together?
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.360]   Yeah, I mean, it's actually pretty wide.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:04.080]   But it's in a pretty small space.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:09.520]   And it's just like I throw on records that are already scratchy.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.200]   And it adds a little warmth to it.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:14.280]   It's just a beautiful, fun thing to have.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:15.800]   So are you buying new record?
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.440]   You didn't keep your old record collection.
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:24.680]   No, you can buy just good quality old vintage stock, like new stock.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.640]   Do you get the heavy vinyl?
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.880]   What are the 30 ounces or whatever they call it?
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.480]   100.85 gram, audiophile grade vinyl.
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:33.160]   Thank you very much, Patrick.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:37.720]   Well, the really crazy stuff is like the 45 RPM LPs.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.160]   So it'll turn like a coal train album into like six or eight sides or something.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.160]   She's--
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.680]   It's so--
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.200]   Wow.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:50.080]   I think Kevin's got the right thing, like, you know, buy something cool,
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.320]   throw it on there, enjoy the scratches, and just roll with it.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.160]   You know what?
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:58.560]   This is so much better than buying a Mac Pro, I might just get it.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.440]   No.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.240]   You won't be sorry.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.560]   Oh, it's so beautiful.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:07.920]   It is a work of art.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:08.600]   Oh, my God.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.960]   And he builds these by hand one by one, probably, right?
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.480]   That's right.
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:15.040]   Yeah, it took me a couple of months to get mine.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.680]   Well, if I ever make it big, that would be a nice thing.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.160]   They have some other ones as well.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.640]   They have a smaller one.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.520]   They have them--
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.880]   see which one is it called?
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:25.480]   One can dream.
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:26.440]   Tabletop.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:27.760]   One can dream.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.720]   But you can also get amazing sounding gear that costs, you know,
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.760]   a fraction of what that console will cost.
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:40.040]   You can also buy vintage consoles and have somebody go through it for--
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.080]   you know, it's one of my neighbors back where you still
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.880]   live in Alameda bought vintage, like, you know, old '50s, '60s consoles,
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.480]   the big massive units.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.440]   And he would either use those for parts for other consoles,
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:57.400]   or restore them, you know, fix them up, and either resell them,
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.080]   or keep them.
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.240]   It's kind of fascinating to watch,
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.440]   because the entire audio industry is kind of moving
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:07.040]   in two directions simultaneously.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.840]   Well, one of the things that's kept us alive
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.680]   is home theater and surround sound.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.600]   Now that we're all home watching a lot more TV,
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.840]   people don't build stereo systems anymore.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.600]   But they might be building a home theater system that
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.960]   doubles as a stereo system, right?
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:22.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:23.240]   Yeah, it's moving.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:27.080]   It's funny, because, like, the audio file people get really--
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.640]   in many cases, get really pissy about surround sound,
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.280]   because it's like, well, you're optimizing for the reproduction
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.440]   of this, you know, surround experience,
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.880]   but not the two-channel audio experience.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:41.880]   The vinyl people hate anybody who's using anything digital,
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:43.760]   or for that matter, in many cases.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.280]   It's funny to watch, because when you--
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.080]   especially if you go into the forums,
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.880]   there's so much infighting.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.880]   It's kind of hysterical to watch.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.480]   You know, the headphone-- the speaker people trash-talking,
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.920]   the headphone people, the headphone people
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.760]   talking about why their experience is better.
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:00.640]   And there's moments where I'm just like,
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.040]   there's so much hate.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.240]   Just shut up and listen to what you like.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.240]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.040]   You got a great point, Patrick.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:07.760]   It's funny.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:12.120]   Like, I don't even have any type of surround sound,
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.600]   or any type of speaker system hooked up to my TV.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.320]   I just like the default built-in speakers of the TV
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.160]   is what I listen to.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.160]   Oh, that's the fusion drive of television.
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:22.160]   Well, I hate it is.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.760]   But, like, I don't care.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:26.280]   I would much rather listen to something amazing on vinyl
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.680]   than how that be my thing.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.160]   Are you really learning the music?
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.000]   Wow.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.960]   Do you watch movies at all, or do you watch
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.200]   any, like, high-quality television series at all?
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.680]   I do watch high-quality-- I'm on Minto Ozark right now,
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.000]   and then I watch basketball.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.480]   It's amazing.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.000]   I mean--
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.320]   But we only watch, like, two hours of TV a week,
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.080]   my wife and I, we don't really watch a lot of TV.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.360]   We used to when basketball was on.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.520]   We'd just watch it on an iPad, though.
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:51.240]   It's amazing.
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:54.000]   It's amazing how good the soundtracks are
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.080]   in television series now.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.280]   And just even putting a simple set of stereo speakers
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:03.480]   or a sound bar will just vastly increase the immersion.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.120]   It's amazing how much a really good audio experience.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.560]   And it doesn't have to be an expensive surround sound system
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:10.840]   or a cheap surround system.
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.920]   Just having a decent pair of stereo speakers
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.640]   that cover most of the audio range
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.400]   makes a huge difference in what's going on.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.800]   And you start realizing how clever some of the audio work is
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:23.280]   in some of the television series or movies these days.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:23.640]   All right.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.280]   That's a good point.
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.280]   Robert, I don't want to spend too much money.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:27.680]   I want to get some nice speakers.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.280]   What do you like?
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.320]   I think Patrick's suggestion for a sound bar is the way to go.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.400]   And the one I'm using right now is the Sonos Beam.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:39.400]   It's their smaller sound bar compared to the Playbar.
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.400]   And my favorite thing about Sonos,
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.240]   other than pretty decent audio quality,
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:45.880]   is their freaking app.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:49.080]   And with that, I have every audio CD
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.280]   I've ever owned ripped to a NAS box.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.600]   And that can deal with tens of thousands of tracks
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.520]   in a lossless format.
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:00.040]   And let me stream that however I've owned around the house.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.680]   And I absolutely adore that.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:06.800]   And what I'm hoping for coming up is an upgrade for--
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:09.880]   my TV has built in Dolby Atmos support.
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:13.400]   And for TV speakers, it sounds OK.
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.400]   But I really, really want to get a set of audio speakers
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.800]   that can at least simulate it maybe with a sound bar system
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:23.360]   or eventually I'll get the full blown pump theater
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.080]   with four speakers in the ceiling in addition to the seven
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.000]   speakers around.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.960]   Eli, I mean, Eli's a great speaker company right now.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.040]   They're a German speaker company.
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.880]   And a couple of years ago, Andrew Johnson,
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.560]   and who had been doing stuff for Pioneer
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:38.640]   started doing some designs.
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:41.440]   And he's just flat out trying to give you
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:44.280]   as much acoustic performance for the least amount of money
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.000]   possible.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.120]   I mean, Eli 2B 2.0 is a fantastic speaker.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:51.080]   And you don't have to get super audio-filedly about it.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:54.360]   He basically redesigned when he did the second debut
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.920]   is because they did this very high performing speaker
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.000]   for not much money.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.040]   Made a decent amp to push it.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:03.480]   But then the entire industry started to kind of like, oh,
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.680]   people will buy decent speakers.
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.600]   And then they did the debut 2.0.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.600]   And I think it's the reference series.
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:11.440]   That's the new one.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.400]   I haven't heard that one yet.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.960]   I hear amazing things about that.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.400]   But the original debut 2.0, they're on sale right now
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:19.240]   for like 30% off on Amazon.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.680]   It's like $230 for care of really solid speakers.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:27.480]   And they sound astonishingly good for the money.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.600]   You know, it's funny that Scott Wilkinson's
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.320]   been telling me to get these for more than a year.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.440]   And I keep thinking about it.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.160]   But yeah, E-L-A-C.com.
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.800]   Oh, they're a German company.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.800]   I mean, Andrew Johnson, he's a--
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:42.920]   He's a key legend.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.000]   And with good reason.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.360]   But it's amazing because there are a lot of companies
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:49.760]   right now.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:52.080]   Mr. Speakers-- actually, it's Dan Clark Audio.
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.040]   And that was one of my favorite headphone companies.
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.520]   There's some amazing audio quality
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.520]   that doesn't cost a lot of money.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.560]   Because you see a lot of stuff, especially
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.920]   if you're going to like a can jam or some of the audio shows.
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:05.880]   You'll walk into a room.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.320]   And I remember walking into room,
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.080]   and somebody's like, this just sounds astonishing.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:12.560]   And I'm like, well, this is $600,000 worth of speakers
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.280]   and amps.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.520]   If it doesn't sound astonishing, something's horrendously wrong.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:20.760]   But it's kind of amazing when you look at somebody like RSL
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.520]   doing a speedwoofer, which is this 10-inch woofer that
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.440]   has phenomenal performance.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:29.120]   I think Brent Butterworth picked it as Wirecutter's pick.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.640]   Or what E-LACs do them with their speakers.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.640]   Emotiva is out trying to--
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:34.280]   I have a--
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:35.280]   Emotiva's at home.
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.200]   Yeah, those are nice.
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:37.120]   Yeah, I like those.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.440]   There's some astonishingly good gear for not that much money.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.600]   And it's kind of fun to watch that happen.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.120]   Rhett Kahn in our chat room has revels.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.600]   Rhett Kahn, George Lucas, leave those to you and his will.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.320]   That's nice.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.240]   Brothers are nice.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:55.440]   No, they're very nice.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:57.320]   Really, I thought they were hugely--
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:02.120]   so years ago, Scott Wilkinson had a friend who
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:05.400]   were scoring the Sony Uncharted--
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.640]   I think it was Uncharted 2 or 3.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:10.760]   And they used this symphony orchestra sound stage
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:14.960]   at Lucas down here in the Marine sky--
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.600]   Skywalker.
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.000]   Skywalker Ranch.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.560]   It's one of the last few symphonic sound stages
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.320]   where you can get 100 musicians.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.160]   He invited me down.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.720]   It was amazing.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.720]   So I'm on the floor listening in the room with these guys.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:28.320]   And there's nothing better than that.
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.920]   If you're lucky enough to stay in the middle of a symphony,
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.120]   that's pretty good.
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.360]   But then I went into the control room
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:36.280]   with these beautiful Rebel speakers.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.640]   And it was pretty indistinguishable.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.720]   It sounded really, really good for a quick AB test.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.560]   I was impressed.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.480]   But I'm sure those were the high end diamond cone, whatever it is.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:47.360]   Well, but it's also--
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.440]   I mean, it's kind of hysterical because--
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:52.640]   do you remember Robert when we were up in the tower at CES
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.240]   and we walked into this room?
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:57.000]   And one of the guys from the Super Potential Audiomatic
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:57.920]   who was in there--
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:00.040]   he sounded like the comic book guy.
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.600]   And he's talking about his personal Niagara recorder
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:05.360]   and how he had recorded his showtuse.
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.440]   And he's name dropping.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:08.960]   And I think Rob looks over.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:12.160]   It'd be really funny because I'm basically standing on my chair.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:13.720]   And then I'm dropping down low.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.640]   And then I'm back on the chair again.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:18.480]   And there were these beautiful speakers.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:22.400]   They were just visually stunning, like seven feet tall.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:25.400]   And they were talking about their diamond tweeter technology.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:28.320]   And they sounded like ass.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.720]   I'm like, I'm scared--
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.960]   because they were like 80, my head's
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.280]   not at the right level to hear the high--
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:36.880]   they were 800,000-dollar speakers.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.080]   Don't laugh.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.560]   Did they really sound that bad?
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.560]   Or is it just bad?
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.200]   I'm like, 1,000.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.400]   But we went two doors down.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:47.240]   But it's so funny you mentioned Ravelle.
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:50.400]   Because I was sitting there because I looked at Rob
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.600]   and I was like, oh, there's like $100,000 speakers.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:53.840]   And we found out, like, two days later,
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:56.240]   there are $400,000 speakers.
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:59.000]   And like, two doors down was Ravelle.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.280]   And they had-- which is still incredibly expensive,
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.000]   $20,000 speakers.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.280]   But they were astonishing.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.360]   The imaging, the sound, the low end.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.360]   Everything was just-- it was everything you
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.160]   want out of your $20,000 speakers,
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:17.120]   except I want to pay $500 or $1,000.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.560]   But we were laughing because it was like,
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:23.600]   you had these amazing looking, ridiculously house
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.200]   money for a pair of speakers.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.000]   And they sounded atrocious.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.840]   And that's one of the frustrating things
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.320]   about when you start getting to the audio file stuff,
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.400]   is you start seeing these companies that
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:39.480]   are selling like $1,000 cables or $300 USB cables
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:45.160]   or my personal favorite, the audio file grade $900 switch,
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.960]   which is essentially a modified $35.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.840]   It's essentially like a $35 switch
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:54.360]   that they modify and resell for like $700 or $900.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.160]   There's no measurable difference.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.200]   If you blind day be it, there's no difference.
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.760]   And it's a little frustrating to see some of the stuff that's
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:04.720]   out there.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.200]   And then you hear something that's amazing.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.480]   And it's like, oh.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.720]   So I don't know.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:12.120]   It's curious, the whole thing.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.840]   But we were talking before everyone
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:17.840]   went to commercial and the rest of us ran to the bathroom.
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.960]   It's good that they have that catheter for you.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.400]   That's just to go the entire time.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:30.200]   So I like headphones.
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:33.440]   And you taught me about headphones back with the greatos,
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.640]   way back when.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.560]   Because it's so amazing all the headphones that
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:38.800]   are out these days.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:41.480]   And then I bought-- and this was Scott Wilkinson's
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.200]   recommendation.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.280]   He reviewed it recently.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.320]   This little DAC.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:48.680]   It's called a hip DAC from IFI.
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:51.400]   And it's a battery backed up.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.200]   So it's got its own power.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:59.600]   And you take the USB out of your MacBook, which has an OK DAC.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.200]   Or I'm using it with the XPS 13.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.720]   And so you just get the digital audio from your device.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.400]   You can even use it with your iPhone if you want,
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.640]   with the right cable.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.080]   And this really makes a big difference.
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:13.000]   And then you can put some decent headphones in.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.200]   It sounds good.
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:17.520]   And this way, I'm a little more portable.
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:18.920]   Well, there's a lot of--
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:19.040]   And there's a lot of--
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:20.360]   --with my workstation.
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.000]   Actually, I'd love to have some good speakers with these.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.680]   It might be pretty good.
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:27.680]   It's funny.
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:31.960]   AudioQuest, who makes expensive speaker cables.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.160]   But they do a whole series.
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.600]   This is their high M1 that I got in for review, the Dragonfly.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.560]   That's a DAC?
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.040]   And that thing?
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:40.040]   This is the DAC.
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:40.040]   Wow.
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.400]   This is the actual physical DAC.
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:41.880]   That's awesome.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.560]   And these things are ridiculously good.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.200]   I would start with the black, unless you
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:48.280]   have some planar magnetic headphones that
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:49.320]   require a lot of power.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:52.560]   This thing's complete overkill for the vast majority.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.720]   But the other because Dragonfly back
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:56.880]   is amazing for the money.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.600]   I am listening on high-five-man electro planar, whatever.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.080]   You should look at Dan Clark audio and the AON2
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.200]   that they just came out with.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:10.200]   I'm actually just getting a set of those to take a look at.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.560]   But Dan Clark, if you want to--
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.880]   their closed headphones are astonishing.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:15.360]   If you could--
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:15.360]   If you could--
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:15.360]   --if you could--
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:16.360]   --if you could--
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:17.360]   --if you could--
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:20.760]   I should probably just wear hearing aids in that worry.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:21.440]   Or even at it.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.360]   Oh, these are pretty.
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:26.640]   And it's funny because when he came out with those,
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.880]   like the original Aons, I was talking to him,
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.360]   like you're delivering something.
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.440]   It's like as good as your primary product.
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:34.720]   But for half the price.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.880]   And part of his thing is he's just out there
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:39.040]   to kind of blow up the industry.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.120]   And deliver as much as possible.
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:41.560]   It must break his heart because there's
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:45.720]   so many kids listening on these little white iPod headphones
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:46.840]   or iPhone headphones.
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.640]   Well, I don't think you're hearing the music.
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:49.440]   I really don't.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:51.280]   But that also used to be something I remember
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:53.960]   with revision three offices is I kind of became like--
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:54.960]   You know, the--
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:55.480]   Headphone man.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.200]   --people be like, I hear you.
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.000]   I hear you can make my music sound better.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.160]   And I'd hand them a set of headphones.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:01.920]   And they disappear.
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:04.480]   And they come back and they'd be like, oh.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.080]   And even like a set of Sony MDR-7506s,
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:10.000]   which Robert's probably wearing right now or has near them,
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.160]   like for 80 bucks.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:11.640]   Those are good.
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.400]   Yeah, those are good.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:13.240]   They're on my head right now.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:19.120]   Pair with an external or a USB DAC that I love.
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:22.880]   From a company called Shit and their FOLA.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:23.480]   Oh.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.000]   S-C-H-I-T-T.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.840]   They're very good.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:28.960]   Yeah, I-I-T.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:29.480]   I-I-T.
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:30.640]   But I should.
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:33.600]   Something that gave me a physical knob,
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.280]   like old school analog knob for volume control.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.120]   That's really all I wanted.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:39.560]   But it happens to perform perfectly.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.840]   And if you're looking for a headphone amplifier,
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.560]   take a look at a company called JDS Labs.
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.440]   I know these guys.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:45.800]   I know they're friends.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.880]   But they're Adam Amplifier for $99.
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:51.760]   When you go to someplace like audio science review,
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:53.960]   it's outperforming.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:57.400]   This is a $99 inexpensive product they did.
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.880]   Because they do their elements.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:02.480]   It was just like, my old headphone amplifier DAC
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.480]   was kind of trash.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.560]   They had just come out with the element.
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.720]   I fell in love with it.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:09.160]   And then the primary engineer spent a couple of years
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.440]   kind of experimenting and figuring out how to lay out
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:12.080]   the boards.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:14.200]   And he's created this--
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:18.160]   I was laughing because I had this like $1,300 set
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:22.040]   of like this very serious audio company's speakers.
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:24.440]   And it was picking up all the noise
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.840]   from my 34 inch curved monitor.
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:28.000]   And it was really frustrating.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.680]   Because if there was a pause something,
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:31.680]   or if there was a quiet passage, I would hear noise
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:32.600]   from the monitor.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:35.040]   And then this $99 headphone amplifier,
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.480]   you could basically shove it up against the alternator of a car.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.560]   And it picked up nothing.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.720]   I mean, it was next to this monitor.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.160]   And it was picked up nothing.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:44.160]   And it's amazing.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:46.080]   Like companies like these guys like JDS Labs.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:49.600]   And again, like Mr. Speakers, they're
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:54.720]   delivering astonishing audio quality for not that much money.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:56.440]   And it's pretty amazing to look at.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:59.560]   Is this the stuff you guys talk about on AVXL?
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.160]   It is.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.600]   We talk a lot about screens and projectors and content
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:05.200]   and what's going on in the industry.
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:11.160]   And yeah, Robert's kind of a mate.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:14.000]   If you ever want to know about televisions, Robert--
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.200]   I know stuff.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:18.920]   He is calibrated several of my TVs.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.960]   Thank you, Robert, very much.
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:21.800]   You are very welcome.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:23.920]   Yeah, without his calibration, I wouldn't
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:27.840]   know if the field is red or blue.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:30.320]   I showed today brought to you by a longtime sponsor.
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.240]   We really appreciate.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:34.360]   It's a message from Zip Recruiter.
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:38.280]   Right now, they say, we cannot be overwhelmed.
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.960]   We have to work to keep our loved ones safe,
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.120]   protect our communities.
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:45.160]   We have to work to stay strong, to stay connected
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.120]   to stay focused.
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:48.720]   We have to work to inspire, to innovate,
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:50.200]   to build new solutions.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:54.440]   But for all of this to work, we have to work together.
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:57.920]   At Zip Recruiter, we connect employers and people every day.
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:59.440]   But today is different.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:01.600]   We're partnering with first responders,
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.040]   government officials, the medical community,
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.720]   the innovators and the manufacturing transportation
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.000]   and food distribution industries.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.960]   We want to make sure we're finding the right people
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:13.360]   for the right jobs right now.
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.600]   Let's work together.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:18.120]   ziprecruiter.com/worktogether.
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:21.280]   ziprecruiter.com/worktogether.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.560]   I thank you, Zip Recruiter, for your support
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.960]   through all of the good times.
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:28.040]   And now, through the harder times,
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:30.200]   we really have a lot of respect for Zip Recruiter.
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:31.080]   We use it.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:31.760]   We love it.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:35.360]   And we're kind of glad that they're around.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:37.480]   ziprecruiter.com/worktogether.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:38.840]   Thank you, Zip Recruiter.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:41.800]   What do people love sports do these days?
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:43.520]   It's all old sports events.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.960]   I racing, baby.
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:45.480]   Virgin.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:46.960]   Are you in the I racing?
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.320]   It is the coolest freaking thing.
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:52.600]   Their F1 was trying to do it with the F1 2019 software.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:57.640]   And the drivers themselves said that this is way too arcadey.
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.200]   It's kind of ass.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:03.240]   So this other company that does a league of dedicated
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:06.800]   racing software, accurately modeled tracks and the gear
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:09.760]   to actually, if you wanted, set up the full surround screen
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:12.040]   with pedals and steering wheels.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:15.040]   So how close is it to the--
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.840]   I mean, and I know, drivers are--
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:19.200]   So when you're watching now racing on TV,
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:20.480]   you're often watching--
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:22.840]   you are always watching a simulation.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:26.280]   And these drivers who are driving are the actual drivers.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.520]   How close is it to their--
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:31.640]   I mean, does the skill set translate?
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.840]   Everything except for what one driver described
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:38.200]   as the butt dino, like that seat of the feeling
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:39.560]   in your pants when you're in the corner.
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:44.000]   But in terms of the track modeling and the aerodynamic forces
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.680]   and the setups on the cars, it is as accurate as anything else
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:50.680]   in the world-- nothing else I've seen comes as close.
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:53.040]   If somebody's a good driver on the track,
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.480]   he'll be good at I racing?
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:56.080]   Yes.
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.600]   It would take-- you need some practice,
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.160]   because it is a virtual environment.
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:00.560]   But I am shocked.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:02.420]   They always seem to have at least one
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:05.080]   ringer who's good at the virtual racing.
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:07.900]   But these tracks are so accurately modeled using
[01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.560]   the latest information year to year.
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:11.960]   They actually re-scan them with laser systems.
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:12.460]   Wow.
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:14.200]   And there's a cool video right now on YouTube
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:17.360]   where they do a split screen with the circuit of the Americas
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:18.960]   track in Texas.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:21.880]   And the top half is the I racing running--
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:23.440]   I think it was a Ford GT.
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:25.800]   And on the bottom is a real Ford GT.
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:26.720]   Wow.
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:30.080]   If you squint a little bit, you can't see the difference.
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:34.000]   And it is exposed some of these drivers
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.120]   to a more social aspect.
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:38.560]   And they're for the good and the bad.
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:39.940]   So in a way, that's right, because they're
[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:42.400]   sitting next to the other driver, right?
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.000]   They're not in a car.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.120]   They're actually the guys right there.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:49.240]   It's like the land parties on the screen savers.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:51.040]   A couple drivers have had to be reminded
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.080]   that people can hear what they're actually saying.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:56.640]   One driver loves his job.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:58.360]   Then the other driver who rage quit--
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:01.760]   and he's like, oh, I can't do this.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:04.000]   Within five minutes, the sponsor has tweeted out.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.160]   It's like, well, we don't support losers.
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:07.120]   We support racers.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.720]   Oh, wow.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:09.760]   Oh, it's like holy crap.
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:11.080]   Wow.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:12.360]   Oh, the best.
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:15.440]   Kevin, do you ever get to play any video games at all anymore?
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:17.600]   You used to be pretty good at that stuff.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:18.960]   Sadly, no.
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:21.040]   I downloaded that crossy game.
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:23.480]   I haven't played it yet, though.
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:25.560]   Oh, Animal Crossing.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:26.160]   Yes.
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:26.640]   Yes.
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:28.440]   I've been dying to play that.
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:29.320]   I downloaded it.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.280]   So I officially have it.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:31.480]   I just have to find the time now.
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:32.640]   So that is next to my list.
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:35.400]   Apparently, it's quite a time sink.
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:39.240]   My son has the switch.
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:42.440]   And he won't-- he said, can I just borrow it
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:46.160]   for a little bit to play Animal Crossing, which he bought?
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:47.840]   And he said, no, it takes all day.
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:49.040]   You will never see it again.
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.680]   You don't get to play Animal Crossing.
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:54.400]   But I bought the Nintendo Switch.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.040]   He said, that doesn't matter.
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:58.120]   It's mine now, baby.
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:00.880]   Apparently, you can't find the Switch anywhere because of this game.
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:03.000]   No, I would buy another one just to play the game.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:03.760]   And you can't.
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:06.720]   You can't get it.
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:08.320]   Si.
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:09.920]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:12.480]   We do have a-- in case you were wondering,
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.640]   here we are sitting here, 15 years after our very first show,
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:20.000]   the very first show that could be reasonably called "Twit."
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:27.760]   We've done since then, no, 767 episodes, a lot of them.
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.160]   And the show's changed a little bit.
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:32.680]   I went back and listened to episode one.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:33.680]   I don't know.
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:35.480]   I mean, at the sound quality, everything,
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.000]   I think we've improved a little bit.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.520]   And just to give you an idea, because I know you guys,
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.000]   you know, you're not watching our shows,
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.400]   this is-- we made a little video of what happened this week
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.040]   alone on "Twit."
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.160]   Previously on "Twit."
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:49.400]   Rate my Skype room.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.640]   Have you seen this one?
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:52.980]   Bit of a mess, but adding two points for color coordinating
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:56.160]   bowtie and globe.
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:57.520]   Hands-on photography.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:01.160]   Lightroom, Lightroom Classic, Lightroom Mobile.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:05.240]   We're going to talk about that this week on Hands-O photography.
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:06.480]   Hands-on iOS.
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:11.440]   I want to show you how to take control of your notifications.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:13.120]   Yeah, I should turn that on.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:14.960]   OK, bye.
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.840]   Yeah, sorry about that.
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.880]   I'm going to show you how to use Do Not
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:20.080]   Disturb on your device.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.200]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:24.160]   I did finally get the MacBook Air 2020, by the way.
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:26.280]   If you don't like iPads, you want an actual Mac,
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:28.320]   but you want it to be super portable,
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:31.040]   it fixes everything that was wrong about the 2018
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.520]   version and makes it like that really fabulous 2011 version
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:36.160]   that most of us love.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:37.560]   All about Android.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:41.360]   Some of you might remember that the Android distribution
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.080]   chart has been removed from the web.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.800]   And those news articles always got a lot of views.
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.680]   But it's not really something that the public really needs
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:50.320]   to know.
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:54.440]   It's like how I wore an NSYNC shirt every day of the week
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:55.680]   in eighth grade.
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:57.680]   And at one point, people just said, we get it.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.000]   You like NSYNC.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.600]   So I just stopped wearing an NSYNC shirt every day of the week.
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.520]   Yeah, I mean, the Android distribution chart
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.360]   is exactly like that, actually.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:05.880]   Twit.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:08.040]   Oh my god, Jelly Bean.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.480]   Working at home with you.
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:13.560]   All Android roads, pulling it back to NSYNC
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:14.600]   in the world of flow.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.360]   Not just Android roads.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:17.320]   All roads.
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:18.240]   All roads.
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:18.960]   We love you, Flow.
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:20.160]   We're so happy you're back.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:21.360]   Actually, we had a great time.
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.240]   And it's not in the promo, but Friday night,
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:26.400]   we start inaugurated, which I think
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.120]   is going to be a regular weekly event, our game night.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:32.040]   We were playing Jackbox, which is kind of the successor
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:33.320]   to Know Jack.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:36.080]   It was Aunt Micah, Jason, and I.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.520]   We had a lot of fun.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:40.040]   Is that-- John, do you know, is that available on the Twit
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:42.600]   YouTube feed or the Twit specials somewhere?
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:43.600]   I hope it is.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.920]   But we're going to do more of those.
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:49.200]   We do them 4 PM Pacific, 7 PM Eastern on Fridays.
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:49.640]   Is it there?
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.400]   Yeah, it is.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:55.960]   So you can watch the fun we had playing really terrible games.
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:58.320]   That's me in the plastic bag on the lower left.
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.240]   I actually decided to wear a plastic bag bag.
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:02.400]   Oh, crunch.
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:10.160]   It was terrible, but a lot of fun.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:11.000]   So we're still playing.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:11.960]   It's kind of like a LAN party.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:12.720]   We're still doing it.
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:14.720]   We're still playing the games.
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:16.760]   All right, we're going to have some final conversations
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:19.680]   with my very precious guests this week.
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:23.360]   It's so nice to have Kevin and Patrick and Robert back
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:25.040]   on 15 years later.
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:26.480]   Normally, we'd have cupcakes.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:27.800]   We'd have balloons.
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:33.080]   We decided to forgo all of that during the current crisis.
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:34.560]   And we've donated.
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.320]   As a result, we've taken the money
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:37.080]   we'd spent on that.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:40.080]   And a little bit more, we've donated it to local COVID
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:40.560]   charities.
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:43.000]   So no balloons, no cupcakes.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:46.800]   Yeah, you can have them on your own in your own time.
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:48.640]   This has been a COVID-free show.
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:50.960]   I'm going to keep it that way.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:53.880]   I don't want-- but everybody's sheltering in place,
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:58.360]   wherever you are in Colorado and the Bay Area in Oregon.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.840]   Kevin, has it been difficult for you?
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:04.560]   Or is it-- it sounds like you guys have a kind of cozy lifestyle
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:07.200]   anyway these days?
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:08.880]   I mean, the only thing that's challenging
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:14.120]   is two kids, two and one, that we just
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:16.120]   have to handle all the time around the clock.
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:17.480]   Right, right.
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:18.880]   There's interruptions with work.
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.360]   And you're doing Zoom calls.
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.280]   And the two-year-old wants to hang out with Dada.
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:25.520]   And I could see-- it's just a little different than the norm.
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:28.200]   But at the end of the day, it's like--
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:30.800]   I think the thing that is hardest for me
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:34.640]   is my 80-year-old mom, who lives not too far away from me.
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:37.720]   And I do go shopping.
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:38.760]   I do things like that.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:42.640]   So when I go to her house, I'm extra paranoid.
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:45.080]   Because she already has long issues.
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:49.480]   And it's just like I'm freaked out about that.
[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:53.360]   So as I'm sure, we all have something similar, right?
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:56.400]   Somebody in our lives that is immune compromised
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.400]   or something's going on.
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:59.280]   And you're extra careful.
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.320]   And it's the best you can do.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:04.480]   My mom's 87, and she's alone.
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:06.600]   My sister lives nearby a couple blocks away.
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:09.080]   But nobody comes in the house.
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:10.320]   It's not safe, right?
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:13.280]   And so I really think about people--
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:15.640]   of course, elders are often isolated anyway.
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:18.360]   But I really think about people who are alone right now
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.520]   and how difficult that must be.
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:22.720]   You and I were lucky enough to be with our families.
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:24.240]   And that's good.
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.920]   And I do Zoom calls with my kids,
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.960]   because Abby's in Marin and Henry's--
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:29.960]   I don't know where Henry is.
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:31.680]   He wasn't in San Francisco.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:34.480]   I think now he's got somewhere else.
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.640]   He's sheltering in place with his good buddy.
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:39.280]   I think he's in Monterey as a Pacific Grove.
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.360]   But we do Zoom calls together.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:44.400]   But yeah, it can be really hard for older people,
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:45.200]   I think, especially.
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:50.280]   Because they're so high risk, that they just can't see anybody.
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:53.680]   Patrick, it sounds like you're maybe in a very small quarters.
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:56.120]   With your family, is that been all right?
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:00.880]   It's being in--
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:06.480]   I mean, gosh, being in three or 400, 500 square feet--
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:07.200]   Yikes.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:10.440]   --with two adults, two children, and a husky
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.040]   is always an exciting process.
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:14.440]   You got a husky in there, too?
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.040]   Well, half husky, half shepherds.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:16.600]   Geez, Louise.
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:18.360]   --looping around here somewhere.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.760]   Wow.
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:23.760]   But yeah, when you throw in an extra husky
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.840]   or a couple of cats to really make things exciting,
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:29.040]   but it's kind of been fun.
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:30.960]   I think it funds out the right word.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:32.960]   It's been fun talking to friends of ours who
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:36.360]   are homeschooling or home with their kids.
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:41.280]   And it's a laugh, because one of my friends was just like,
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:43.120]   how did you homeschool your kids?
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.000]   I want to do it.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.560]   And I was just like, breathe.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.600]   But you've been doing this all along, right?
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:49.160]   For years.
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:49.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:50.800]   Before this, you've been homeschooling.
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:53.120]   And it's-- yeah, I was like, one, it's always hard.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:56.080]   Two, you're starting homeschooling from scratch
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.000]   after disrupting everything your child
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.560]   is familiar with an education.
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:00.560]   That's right.
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:05.520]   And also dealing with, hey, how do you explain to your small child
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:08.400]   or your young child, like what this means?
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:09.440]   What is a pandemic?
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:10.760]   Why are we wearing masks?
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:12.480]   Why can't I go over to my friend's house?
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.880]   Why can't we play on the playground?
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:15.480]   Why is the movie theater closed?
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:18.240]   So this is incredibly challenging for everybody.
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:21.520]   And most people are doing pretty good at it.
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:23.520]   Yeah.
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.880]   Well, you guys, tell you what, if you're with people you love,
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:29.760]   it's a lot easier.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:30.760]   So that's why it's nice.
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:33.840]   If it's a family that really gets along, it can be OK.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:34.640]   How about you, Robert?
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:35.880]   You doing all right?
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.320]   Yeah, overall.
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:40.120]   I had some incredibly horrible illness
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.920]   in the late December of last year
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:44.320]   that lasted literally like a month and a half.
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:46.280]   I wonder if you had it.
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:48.480]   I would love to be tested.
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:50.560]   They're my own hospital has like,
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.760]   unless you're exhibiting symptoms,
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:53.000]   don't come anywhere near us.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.720]   And so I'm like, if I've had it and I'm over it,
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:01.120]   I would love to get out, donate blood plasma or whatever.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:04.680]   Yeah, my son got back from Asia.
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:09.960]   And on the 28th of March, he was in Bali, Vietnam.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:12.600]   He was traveling all over, was living with a bunch of kids
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:16.480]   in Bali, finally convinced him to come home about a week
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:17.280]   after he got home.
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:18.920]   He got sick.
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:19.880]   He had a headache.
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.400]   He was weak.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.520]   He had muscle pains.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.080]   He coughed.
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:26.520]   And we couldn't get him tested.
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:27.720]   He's much better now.
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:28.360]   He's fine now.
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.040]   He's 100% now.
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:31.760]   And I told him, you might be in luck.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:32.880]   You're one of the first--
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:34.720]   he just graduated from college last year.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:37.480]   He might be one of the first people in your age cohort
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:38.840]   to be able to go out and work.
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:41.880]   Because you might have immunity.
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:45.400]   Steve Gibson also got weirdly very ill.
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:46.720]   Wasn't able to get tested.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:48.000]   He's recovered.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.200]   So people like you and Steve and my son,
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.640]   you could be the golden.
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:56.600]   You might have that yellow card you can carry around saying,
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:58.200]   I'm COVID free.
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:00.120]   I got the immunity.
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:03.000]   Now, just doing whatever I can to keep friends and family
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.680]   calm and safe and anything anybody needs, I can get it done.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.680]   Nice.
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:10.400]   And all our local businesses are closed down,
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:12.760]   except for essential services like many places.
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:13.200]   But--
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:15.480]   Well, in a way, we're lucky because we're all--
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.160]   all of us are already a little bit introverted.
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:18.840]   We're used to staying at home.
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:21.320]   We're used to having Skype chats.
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:22.480]   And this isn't so good.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:24.320]   It's not a dramatic change in my cell.
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.960]   It really is.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:29.600]   Yeah, one of my hardcore extrovert friends
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:33.360]   was saying how horrible this was.
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:36.440]   And I said, dude, this is exactly how I feel when you invite me
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.240]   to a party where I don't know what you're doing.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:39.360]   Yes, it's true.
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:42.200]   Yes, exactly.
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:43.160]   I love you guys.
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:44.560]   It's so nice to see you.
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:47.920]   I am so glad you're all doing so well.
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:51.440]   And I thank you for being friends for more than 20 years
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.080]   now since the Tech TV days.
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:55.960]   When we started, when I started Twit,
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:00.040]   I did-- and I bring this to every time-- offer both Patrick
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:02.400]   and Kevin partnership in the company,
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:04.480]   but they declined, which is a good thing
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:09.240]   because you'd still be working for a living right about now.
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:11.920]   But Kevin obviously didn't need me.
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:13.440]   He did much better without me.
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:14.800]   And I'm glad you're doing so well.
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.320]   And I'm glad the family's doing well.
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:17.720]   Patrick, I love you.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:20.360]   I hope you find a home at some place.
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:21.800]   Oh, we will.
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:22.920]   Somehow, at some time.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:23.640]   We will.
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:24.200]   But--
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:25.560]   There's a lot of America to look at.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:26.060]   Yeah.
[02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:26.800]   Come to Portland.
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:27.800]   Come to Portland.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:28.320]   Maybe--
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:29.320]   You know, India.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:31.440]   --sealums about as close as we can get,
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.480]   unless the real estate prices come down
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.600]   in a huge way in Portland.
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:35.920]   I love Portland.
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:36.720]   We both look.
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:39.200]   The mere fact that Powell's book is in Portland
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.520]   is enough to make me want--
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:41.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.200]   --in Powell's books in the shelving system,
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:45.640]   running around there at the Flashlight.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:46.320]   It's pretty cool.
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:47.760]   Pretty cool.
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.760]   Robert Herron, great to have you two.
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:54.560]   It's always a pleasure to see a former lab rat.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:57.320]   I have much to thank you for.
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:00.040]   And you've always treated me really well.
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:03.040]   Even in the earliest days of me being at Tech TV
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:06.240]   and being the underling on Call for Help,
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:07.600]   I just ever since then.
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.400]   And throughout the last 15 years,
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.600]   we've had-- it's been fun to watch your career--
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.040]   It's been great, as well.
[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:14.080]   --all of our careers.
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:14.520]   And--
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:15.200]   Oop, pardon me.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.240]   And it's--
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:18.800]   I'm glad I know you people.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:19.600]   And it's really--
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:20.800]   I find it quite special.
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:22.040]   Oh, great hug.
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:23.040]   I love you guys.
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:24.640]   I love you guys.
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:26.920]   And it's been a really fun 15 years.
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:28.840]   I look forward to 15 more.
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:29.840]   No, I don't think so.
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:32.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:33.640]   And VR.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:34.640]   It's a point.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:36.440]   And a fantasy a couple of weeks ago
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:38.960]   that maybe on this episode, I'd say, hey, it's been great.
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:40.040]   Thanks so much.
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:41.600]   I hope you all have a good life.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:43.840]   I'll see you later and just walk off.
[02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:44.840]   Turn off the line.
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:45.340]   Done.
[02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:47.360]   I'm done.
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:48.840]   Couldn't do it.
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:49.600]   Couldn't do it.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:50.920]   I love this too much.
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:51.480]   Thank you guys.
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.840]   Come back real soon, OK?
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:54.840]   We really appreciate you.
[02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:55.440]   Stay safe.
[02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:56.040]   Stay safe.
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:56.240]   Stay safe.
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:57.280]   You guys too.
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:58.240]   We do do it.
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:00.600]   Every Sunday afternoon, 230 Pacific,
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:03.640]   that's 530 Eastern time, 2130 UTC.
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:05.200]   You can watch us do it live.
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:07.480]   Twit.tv/live is the live stream.
[02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:09.320]   Audio and video there.
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:11.800]   You can also get it on demand after the fact,
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:15.120]   because we put it in every show we do here on the website
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:16.720]   at twit.tv/swit.tv/swit.
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:20.360]   And you know, your Amazon Echo or your Google Home,
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:23.640]   any voice activated device, you could probably just say,
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:26.560]   if you want to listen to the live stream, something like, hey,
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:28.800]   Echo, play Twit Live.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:32.040]   And if you want to hear the latest episode of any of our shows,
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:35.000]   just say, hey, Echo, play this week in tech,
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.200]   and it'll play it.
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:38.480]   Download a copy.
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:38.760]   You know what?
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:39.880]   The best thing to do?
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:41.880]   Subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:42.760]   That way you'll get it.
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:45.080]   The minute it's available, you don't have to think about it.
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.200]   You don't have to even listen to it,
[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:48.480]   but you'll have it if you get a little bored.
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:53.800]   You're out there walking the dog, or sewing masks.
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:56.800]   A podcast is an excellent thing to listen to while you're
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:58.280]   sewing the mask.
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:06:59.120]   Thank you, guys.
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:06:59.840]   Thanks, everybody.
[02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:02.840]   I'm going to say it again for the 15th year in a row.
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:04.880]   Another Twit is in the can.
