[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.240]   [Music]
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:06.120]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech to show we cover the week's tech news, which is going to be more and more of a challenge as these weeks go by.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.720]   So we thought, you know, maybe there's not a lot of news, but I'm going to bring some of my favorite people and we'll just have a nice conversation.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.120]   And actually the last 45 minutes, that's all we've been doing. Then I started the recording.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.160]   Here's Devinder Harder, our senior editor at Engadget.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.680]   He's quarantining in place in Brooklyn with an 18 month old and his wife.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.280]   Oh boy.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.440]   Now, do you still get like phones like the new like the iPhone SE and stuff?
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.720]   Oh, yeah. So yeah, if I pan my chair a little, it's just boxes behind me, like a pile of boxes I'm hiding.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.160]   Not really phones. I do a lot of computers.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.440]   So over pretty much over the last couple of weeks, I've reviewed like a computer or something every week.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.080]   Or maybe those like there's still things.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.760]   So they're keeping you busy.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.840]   Obviously that's good.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.080]   I'm busy.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.960]   I've been going to the officer thing has been vacuumed up just writing more and doing more stuff, which is not great, but whatever.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.160]   Like there's a lot of stuff to do.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.960]   I'm trying not to stay bored and stay sane with the baby and my wife.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.000]   Oh, man, you have my sympathy.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.240]   I'm myself. I'm trying to grow a ponytail.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.120]   You do what I believe in you.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.640]   Yeah, I hear a voice that I sound from my distant past.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.000]   It sounds familiar. Is that it is a shearer?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.440]   Oh, hi, shearer.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.840]   Gosh, I miss you.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.040]   I was up. I am so happy to be here.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.400]   This feels like a reunion. It's a new long and it's an honor.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.520]   I like I love being here.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.160]   It feels like home again.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.400]   Yeah. Thank you.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.880]   So that's why I thought it'd be nice to get together with old friends and kind of hobnob.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.680]   And I'm here. Of course, it was trending, but now has a new thing.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.000]   Peace inside. Live.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.920]   This is a is this perfect for quarantine.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.280]   It's a zoom nightly zoom where you meditate.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   You talk about philosophy.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.800]   It's really great.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.720]   It's a live platform.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.440]   Mindfulness movement and meditation.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.560]   And we launched it because all of us were on zoom.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.800]   So we decided to launch these live zoom classes.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.760]   Actually, they're twice a day.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.680]   They're morning and night.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.840]   So you begin your day and end of your day.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.920]   And then we have workshops on the weekend with facilitators from around the world.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.000]   And it's very needed right now, but we're making it fully accessible.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.680]   So right now it's free.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.760]   It's donation to space.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.800]   So we want.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.400]   Yeah, this to be accessible to everyone, no matter what your socioeconomic background is.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.000]   And yeah, I'm really proud of it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.840]   It was a fun project we started in quarantine.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.440]   That's kind of taking on a life of its own right now.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.240]   So all you have to do is go to the site as you can see peace inside that live.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.320]   You put in your email or you could just sign up for classes and you put in your email to RCP.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.840]   And we actually send daily emails in the morning with the live class links to the zooms
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.960]   as well as like some inspiration and positivity for the day.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.720]   I'm not going to have to turn on the camera with me and my yoga pants though.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.240]   Am I you know, you have a choice of whether to turn on the camera or not.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.560]   But what school is there is interactivity?
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.880]   People are sharing at the beginning after the sessions.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.440]   Yeah, so it is much needed right now.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.240]   You could of course do like calm and all these on demand things, but it creates a different
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.400]   type of space when you're interacting with the facilitator and with the community live
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.480]   and in real time. Yeah, no, I completely.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.160]   It's like going to class except that we can do it with zoom now, which I think is great.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.520]   Yeah. Also joining us, my dear friend, Alex Wilhelm, who has gone through many career
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.080]   changes all involving tech crunch.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.760]   Yes.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.080]   I think I think that's fair.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.160]   He is currently back at TechCrunch as a reporter and I was so thrilled when I saw
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.600]   your buy line because the last time you were on, you said, I've got something.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.640]   But I can't tell you.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.000]   So I'm really pleased to see because you you've always done a great job and you're
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.080]   still kind of covering the same beat startups and finance and all that, right?
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.760]   Yeah, that's the same the same goal.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.560]   I'm paying a little bit more attention to actual tech itself because I've been covering
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.840]   these in the fintech space and that's forced me to get a niche down on some
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.760]   product stuff. So I'm becoming slightly more techy.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.720]   You're also starting to talk a little more like a Bitcoin, bro.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.440]   I just want to warn.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.440]   I just love free.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.200]   So it really goes fast.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.120]   I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.640]   Sorry.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.800]   What if I want to dig in on this for a second?
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.320]   Well, Ron, what have I done lately that's reminded you of being a Bitcoin, bro,
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.960]   I need to cut that out, whatever it is.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.680]   So tell me what was the what was the signal that I sent up?
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.280]   Digging deep into fintech.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.640]   There were a few phrases there.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.560]   No, no, no, fintech like, you know, chime, Robin Hood, like, I know it's short for
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.760]   financial technology.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.720]   I understand and fintech is the accepted term.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   But if you start talking about drop shipping from Bali, I'm going to know
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.440]   that you're one of them. OK, I just want to warn you.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.360]   If that happens, you have the right and responsibility to slap me very hard in
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.280]   the face and remind me that I made fun of Bitcoin since 2013.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.920]   That's right.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.560]   I need to keep it up.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.960]   That's right.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.040]   You are no Bitcoin, bro.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.200]   Stay true, sir.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.680]   We got to hold out so far.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.760]   Are you have you been there?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.160]   Have you reviewed the new Dell XPS 13?
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.440]   Because I'm really liking that.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.960]   I did.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.440]   I did.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.440]   It's very nice.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.440]   I love it.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.960]   It's weird how Dell has basically been making the best ultra portable for the last
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.800]   couple of years.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.880]   And this one is just like they still made it better because they got rid of that
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.600]   little bit of bottom bezel that was there before.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.760]   So there's no more Dell logo.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's just all screen.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.080]   No more up your nose cam.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.640]   No more up your nose cam.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.520]   It's fast.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.800]   Intel's new integrated graphic stuff is like not bad.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.520]   It's it's not like it's totally worthy, but you could play like
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.000]   Overwatch in 720p.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.920]   It's it's doable.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.160]   I have in fact, I'm going to do a hands-on tech
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.280]   comparing it to the new MacBook Air because the air really began
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.680]   to be a great feature of the MacBook.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.240]   And this is in my opinion, when you compare it to the current MacBook
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.640]   Air, this is really much more evolved, much more seamless
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.120]   ultra book experience than Apple even at this point.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   Definitely great.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.880]   Great track.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.680]   Like everything.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   Everything's all good.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.080]   I got the developer edition.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.520]   So I'm not running Windows on it, which is another blessing.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.480]   Hey, it's all good.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.920]   Hey, hey, this is.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.520]   Some of us like Windows.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.080]   I mean, like.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.400]   Do you really like Windows?
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:17.920]   Really?
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.760]   You really like Windows.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.760]   How can you like Windows?
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.440]   Sure.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.880]   We don't like Windows to we.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.720]   I am a Mac girl.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.600]   Yeah, no.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.520]   I can't.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.040]   You know what?
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.600]   You know, it's not.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.880]   It's come a long way.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.360]   It's come a long way, but you know, it's not good.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.280]   It's Chrome OS.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.520]   I have a I have a Chromebook that I use for just kind of like on the couch
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.080]   Internet, if you will.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.920]   And things don't work quite as well as I'd hope.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.240]   I was hoping it's going to be really fast and snappy and kind of all the things
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.880]   you hope for.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.840]   And it's just a bit slower than I
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.920]   anticipated.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.520]   So that's been kind of a modern one, Alex, like a newish one or an older one, like the
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.880]   Samsung.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.840]   Yeah, I think I bought the one that wire cutters said to buy.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.640]   So I have a two months.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.240]   I think it's an Acer, right?
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.480]   Asus Acer.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:05.840]   One of the two.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.240]   I think it's an Acer.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.440]   That was the best, but I think these new Samsungs are actually really good.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.080]   They're pricing.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.720]   That's the only problem.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.360]   They're 500 bucks, which is insane.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.040]   Like I like the idea of Chromebooks is
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.960]   except $500 computers.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.680]   So like just bare minimum, just getting a browser and like something that I can use
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.800]   to browse the web or something at 500 bucks and above.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.320]   You just get a Windows PC.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.520]   Like it's fine.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.680]   You can run Chrome and you could do so much other stuff, too.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.720]   Right.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.040]   Yeah, or get a Linux PC.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.800]   I'm not doing this to annoy people because my hair is long and I look like pretty
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.480]   soon I'm having neck beard.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.880]   It's just I'm going to look like one of those guys.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.680]   So why don't you cut your own hair?
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.760]   At least to cut your hair.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.280]   Is that what you would do now? Sure.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.840]   Are you cutting your hair?
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.240]   No, I'm actually growing mine because mine was a very short, but I did dye my hair
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.440]   myself for the first time.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.760]   I was like, why am I paying $150 for hairstylist?
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.560]   I'm a hair.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   So you would be all gray if you didn't die it?
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.600]   No, but I was not all gray, but I was seeing a lot of.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.560]   Were you getting some gray?
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   You're too young to have any gray.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.840]   No, I take it from my dad's side of the family.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.720]   They have the grades.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.560]   My mom doesn't.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.760]   So I got it from his side.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.800]   Yep, you get your dad's hair.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.160]   I would dare his band.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.960]   Dare he.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.800]   That's what they're saying is that all of a sudden we're going to know what all these
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.440]   people's natural hair color is because it's starting to grow out.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.760]   But you can dye it.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.960]   You can dye it yourself.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.880]   You get some beet juice and a comb.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.920]   If you want to go natural comb and you just comb it through and.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.840]   And yeah, I know I don't I think I won't be dying my hair, but I do need a haircut.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.200]   So Lisa wants my wife wants to cut my hair.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.280]   So let her do it.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.680]   Well, this is what this is what gives me a little less confidence.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.280]   She says, look, I cut my own bangs.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.040]   That I don't think cutting your bangs.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.920]   It's not you just go like that.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.000]   So hard bangs are if you see any kids or anyone who tries to cut their bangs,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.640]   you end up cutting it like sometimes here.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.480]   Yeah, get that to the heart.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.680]   So she so that resume, that's good.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.880]   That would be OK, you cut my hair.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.600]   Just go for it.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.240]   What do you have to lose?
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.280]   It's going to be a fun experience.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.480]   I'll tell you what I have to lose.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.640]   I have to lose three months of looking like a bozo because I have a bad haircut.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.920]   At least this it's long.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.240]   Yeah, is this little home on the prairie or is this this weekend?
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.240]   I'm so confused.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.280]   Well, I'm like home.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.160]   Excuse me.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.800]   Who's been cutting your hair, Alex?
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.200]   My wife's college.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.400]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.000]   We all need to choose our man next.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.960]   Now why don't you do a buzz cut?
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.080]   I had a buzz cut.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.280]   In fact, my wedding pictures, I had shaved my head for the for charity for UNICEF
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.720]   back in 2000, whatever.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.920]   And it's terrible.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.640]   It's a bad look.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.720]   I have a bad.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.640]   We're all going to need our Mad Max haircut.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.080]   So it's all going to be buzz cuts for all.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.120]   I feel like if I cut my hair, I would lose people would I would lose respect.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.840]   People would say, Oh, look, he's getting a haircut.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.200]   I should look as ragged as every raggedy.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.560]   As everybody else does.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.040]   Exactly.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.480]   You need to be accessible.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.920]   I'm accessible.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.040]   Speaking of raggedy ass, Elon Musk, this isn't exactly perfect.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.920]   Perfect transition.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.160]   This isn't exactly a tech story, but.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.080]   He tweets free America now.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.080]   That's not as bad as then he tweets.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:33.400]   Yeah, you know, Elon, the Tesla stock prices are too high, in my opinion, wiping,
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.800]   wiping 14 billion dollars off his value.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.880]   I talked to some people said, Hey, at least he's an honest CEO.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.560]   No, no, Alex, no, no defense.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.920]   That's not a defense being very dumb when thousands of people work for you.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.600]   See, it's not it's not a reasonable defense.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:53.960]   It's stupid.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.160]   This was a reckless tweet and like, look, I'm all for dumb posts on Twitter.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.880]   That's like half my job, but this is just silly.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.040]   Like Tesla is not a small company anymore.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.160]   It's not an experiment.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.080]   It's a international company with billions of dollars in revenue, tens of thousands
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.240]   of employees, hundreds of thousands of customers.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.200]   Come on, get your stuff together and, you know, stop behaving like a petulant
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.720]   12 year old and I should have rushed 33.4 million followers.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.440]   When he tweeted that, not only the Tesla stock price tumble, his own value
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.640]   went, he lost three billion dollars in personal wealth.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.440]   It's kind of amazing that somebody would have three billion dollars to lose.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.960]   Yeah, it's a bit irresponsible.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.000]   I think what Alex said, like he can be an egomaniac.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.200]   I think he does he approaches things in extremes or with an extreme perspective.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.280]   And sometimes he looks at himself as
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.560]   that he has so many unique opinions and perspectives, which he does.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.560]   And that's why he's built what he has without thinking about where he's at right
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.120]   now and all the other people that rely on him, right?
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.960]   And so he needs to find that balance between being his eccentric self
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.880]   and like an eccentric leader and then actually being someone who's going to
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.000]   like be practical and in a place of reality.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.160]   Yeah, he is a real CEO at a real company.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.560]   Now, as you say, Alex, who has a lot of employees, by the way, did he not do
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.480]   something similar in 2018 and was he not
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.080]   fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and ordered that if he were to
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.240]   tweet any market moving tweets, he would have to clear it.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.640]   Yes.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.960]   So is he in violation of that?
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.320]   There's nuance to that.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.400]   But I think you refer into the infamous like funding secured $420 per share thing.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.520]   Anytime you see 420 in any of Elon's tweets, don't take them seriously.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.400]   Just if Elon tweets, don't take it seriously.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.520]   In fact, don't follow Elon.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.080]   It's like you don't have to follow Trump on Twitter.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.520]   People will just show you his tweets.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:50.760]   Right.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.280]   That's a lot like Elon's Twitter account.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.440]   If he says anything interesting, you'll see it in the Wall Street.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.960]   People will bring it to your attention or CNBC will put it in a red banner on top
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.000]   of the sites.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.920]   Elon's not doing very good.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   It's very good fun to make fun of him because it's always good fun to make
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.400]   our people or something.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.640]   I think he might have it.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.800]   He's a bit off and I think we it's easy to make fun of it, but there's also that
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.920]   fine balance from like the audience perspective or experts or just like all
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.400]   of us who are we don't know.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.240]   We don't know.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.200]   We don't know.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.080]   Welcome, I'll welcome, I'll in my shoes.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:27.040]   He tweets on Friday, my girlfriend Grimes is mad at me
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.760]   and then follows that up with I'm selling almost all physical possessions.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:39.240]   We'll own No House, which by the way got 253,000 likes on Twitter.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.480]   Here's the thing that we've all noticed because every single one of us has at
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.000]   least tens of thousands of Twitter followers.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.720]   When you have that many Twitter followers, if you tweet out like spaghetti,
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.360]   people will interact with them.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.720]   If you have tens of millions of Twitter followers, you can tweet out anything and
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.320]   it has just has a huge impact.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.120]   He longs just crap posting on Twitter to use a family friendly.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.160]   Is it crap posting?
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.320]   Is that what it is?
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.480]   Honestly, I worry about him to be honest.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.720]   I worry that he's having a breakdown of some kind.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.800]   He yeah, usually if there's no filter, you're either like in a place where you
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.280]   need to express yourself so badly and you need that attention and validation.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.760]   Slash you can't you don't know the boundaries between like your life and the
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.600]   outside.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.040]   Right.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.960]   I know I look at him and I also see like the Godzilla made up of like all of the
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.240]   this is tech culture.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.440]   You know, he is he is the superhero.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.680]   PayPal mafia guy.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.200]   He almost went bankrupt trying to make Tesla and SpaceX happen.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:36.960]   He did this.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.520]   He pushed electric cars forward, but it's like yeah, he clearly doesn't have a
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.280]   sense of a decent sense of self of who he is to understand his role right now and
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.360]   kind of everything he says has consequences.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   Yeah, who said it?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.800]   He keeps in the tweets, but like he is the dumbest smart person around right now.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.600]   And it's sad.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.520]   It's truly sad because I honestly hear I hear a worshiped you on for a long time.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.880]   I had everyone did.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.680]   Yeah, I thought he we can he single handedly made electric vehicles, not only cool,
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.760]   but made them possible.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.720]   And I think that's been very good for the planet.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:18.160]   It's so I wore I actually am a little worried about him or I don't know what to
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:18.640]   think.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.520]   I don't want to. I'm not mad at him.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.000]   Yeah, it's worse than this, though, because we're all looking at his tweets
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.760]   right now and saying this guy's wilding out on Twitter.com, which is bad.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.680]   But during their last earnings call,
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.520]   and if you haven't read Tesla's last earnings report and you want to get
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.840]   confused, go ahead and give it a read during the Q and A session with
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.920]   analyst, if I recall this correctly, he also kind of lost it a little bit and was
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.200]   talking about the closures of the country and how people should be free.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.120]   And just some stuff that was again, not the silver line of concert.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.480]   And his covid tweets have actually been counterproductive.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.040]   They've not. Yes.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.800]   But when you're that brilliant, I feel like in one's part of your life,
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.480]   I feel like your emotional social intelligence might be off.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.680]   Maybe that's it. Yeah.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.600]   And also, if you're a billionaire,
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.880]   F. Scott Fitzgerald said it, he said, the rich are not like you and me.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.840]   You live in a different world if you're a billionaire.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.760]   Nobody says boo to you.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.120]   Yeah, well, pretty much.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.800]   And also, like, it does feel like he is a guy who he
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.640]   the quarantine right now is not about social good for him.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.400]   It's about work at Tesla stopping.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.200]   And costing him a lot, by the way, at the end of the month.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.520]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.240]   Yeah. And that's a company that is basically has been struggling to build
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.840]   cars for a long, long time.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.080]   So like any any bump like this, given how, you know, how much on the razor edge
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.360]   they've been for so long, this is bad for him and bad for Tesla.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.600]   But he does not care about, yeah, saving his people.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.000]   He cares about saving his company.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.840]   Right. I can understand that.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.240]   And space travel guys, we need to go to another
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.080]   Mars thing.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.760]   Send it. Send him to Mars.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.840]   Please just go.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.600]   He also after saying I'm going to sell my positions, I will not have a home.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.080]   He says one stipulation on sale, I own Gene Wilder's old house.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.920]   It cannot.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.800]   This is true, by the way, he does.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.040]   It cannot be torn down or lose any of its soul.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.440]   It's very specific.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.680]   Just like, yeah, Willie Wonka's factory in the basement.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.240]   Yeah, apparently, like that makes sense for Elon Musk.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.920]   I don't, you know, honestly, I hope he's OK.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.520]   Somebody said, Elon, just say you were hacked and move on.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.800]   The problem is I bet he doesn't think he's wrong.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.720]   I bet he thinks he's being right and I bet he's funny or funny, right?
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.880]   He thinks he's funny too.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.600]   Is this an attempt at humor?
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.680]   This book will be funny.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   No, I think he's trying to push what it is to be a CEO founder.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.480]   Like most people don't do this because of corporate America.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.960]   That's true. Yeah, we make what this is, what's possible as like a leader.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.160]   I can be completely authentic.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:51.880]   Fuck every.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.240]   He is being authentic.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:53.720]   Everything.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.000]   Yeah, it's OK.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.360]   You can you can say bad words.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.600]   Also, he has a pregnant
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.200]   Grimes is pregnant.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.600]   He's driving crazy.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.320]   In his 40,000 square foot Willie Wonka mansion.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.840]   There's a great issue.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.880]   I think it's a woman.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.200]   As a woman, I'm not blaming it on the pregnant lady.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.800]   Don't blame it on the pregnant lady.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Nope.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.560]   No, you could be a different kind of CEO, right?
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.120]   And also not be the CEO of Lowe's.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.680]   14 million dollars.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.240]   Right.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.320]   You don't have to you can be not the CEO of Goldman Sachs, who's always very boring.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:27.640]   Right.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.240]   And still not be totally crazy.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.880]   You could be John Ledger crazy.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.600]   Sure.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.720]   That would be OK.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.320]   By the way, that's where my hair is going.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.640]   I think I'm getting John Ledger here.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.800]   That's what it is.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.200]   Oh, man, just don't go all pink on us, please.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.240]   No, no, no, no.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.040]   Seeing seeing John Ledger, like I was covering phone so much like as he came on to T
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.280]   mobile and everything, like seeing him, it's it's a show.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.480]   He's just putting on a circus show.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:58.280]   Like he is the buttoned up 18 T guy, but his persona as the CEO of the CEO.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.880]   I mean, we saw what he was doing.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.560]   We saw what he was doing before T mobile and you.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.000]   You know, he lived that life.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.040]   And I think it was just a great performance for him at T mobile.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.200]   So yeah, that's that's a good example of like working within the boundaries.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   And they did do some really cool stuff at T mobile.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.840]   It's a yeah, it's some really boundary breaking stuff there.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.800]   Here's his.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.440]   Here's his.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.960]   He was out there.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.360]   I was going to say what CEO is out there that is like that balance between like
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.120]   is respectful of the corporate structure, but also pushing the boundaries.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.840]   John's a good example.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.280]   Who else?
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.200]   Is there anybody else?
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.760]   Most I tell you, I never interview CEOs because they never say anything interesting.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.720]   Oh, yes.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.200]   But there have been some.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.800]   Jonathan Schwartz when he was at.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.440]   Son was pretty outspoken.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.920]   Actually, sons always had outspoken CEOs.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.280]   Scott McNeil, he was pretty out there as well.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.000]   I don't, you know, but usually a CEO is a last person.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.400]   It's like interviewing an athlete.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.600]   I came to play.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.720]   We played good.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.960]   You know, it's just never anything interesting.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.440]   And there's a difference between public and private companies too, like I think
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.640]   I'm like Gabriel at Valve, right?
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.440]   And like, he's able to say what he thinks.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.800]   He is interesting and he doesn't have to answer to anybody.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.320]   So yeah, because he's not.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.240]   You often do this thing.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.600]   Here's John Ledger's latest tweet.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:28.240]   By the way, John, not only resigned to CEO and that was effective April 1st, I think.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.280]   He just now left the board.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.840]   So he has no association anymore with T model.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.400]   But he says, so I was this is his latest tweet.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.800]   He is apparently riding a scooter in a T mobile shirt.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.240]   So maybe he gave it up.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.400]   Maybe he does live this.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.760]   So I was out today and somebody saw my close helmet and elliptical.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.720]   And that's the scooter.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.880]   And they said, hey, do you work for T mobile?
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.320]   And I said, I run T mobile.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.000]   No, I don't.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.040]   I will.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.600]   I just love T mobile.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.520]   Oh my God.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.520]   And he looked at me strangely and said, oh, bye.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.360]   He's.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.200]   I know it's kind of sad when you're no longer.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.960]   He's no longer associated.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.680]   You know, he has said he has a T on his back now.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.520]   He has the Roger Stone back tattoo.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.080]   He has it's back.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   No, I'm saying he should.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.400]   That's what I imagine Roger Stone has Richard Nixon on his back.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.280]   Not his back.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.680]   Yeah, that picture reminds me a lot of Jason Neustad post Metallica.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.480]   And if you get that joke, five points to you.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.040]   And I say that as a respectful fan of Jason Neustad, but like if you're part
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.520]   of this thing that I used to be.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.280]   That was a space player and now it's tough.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.680]   I got nothing.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.440]   That's how I'm going to feel.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.080]   I retire.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.640]   I actually often have this vivid imagination of me.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.600]   A bum on the street lying there saying something like I used to be a tech pundit.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.880]   I never retire.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.480]   Leo, you're never going to retire.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.240]   Yeah, I'm going to die in that chair.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.360]   You may want to make a point on the screen savers.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.960]   When we can upload digital consciousness to the cloud,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.400]   like Amazon's upload, like you will be there.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.160]   I have.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.160]   You know, I'm that's amazing.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.960]   I want to go on record and say that I know there are out there a great many
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.800]   people who got in the tech because when they were at formative age, they saw
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.480]   tech TV and they kind of got it in their brain.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.960]   Maybe some of you have figured out how to put brains in a jar.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.800]   I just want you to know that one great way to honor me would be to let me do that.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.160]   Yeah, brain upload.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.360]   Brain in a jar.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.480]   Actually, that's too easy.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   Well, no, I want to upload my brain to machine.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.440]   I don't want to be in a jar.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.200]   Physical matter. Yes.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:30.960]   No, you're right.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.120]   I'm not a child.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   My engineer John says you don't want to be a brain in a jar.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.680]   It's too easy.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.880]   I could do that now.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.840]   No, I want to upload myself to the thing.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.880]   Would you be frozen and then have your consciousness uploaded?
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.120]   So at least we could see like the body.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.680]   Nobody.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.920]   I don't want the body just put me in a machine, preferably a machine sitting
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.760]   in this chair on this set doing the show.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760]   Oh my gosh.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.360]   And for all we know that's already happened and I just haven't received the memo yet.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.680]   Everything's already virtual.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.760]   You don't even need a machine.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.240]   You just need like a screen so we can always see you.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.880]   You know, I'll be Max Hedram.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.760]   Yep. Yep.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.400]   Who's the Bitcoin bro now?
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.920]   OK, OK, fair.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.480]   Fair point.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.760]   You got me. You got me.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.160]   Can I?
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.840]   I'm sure I threw a little bit of consciousness before Bitcoin, by the way, just saying.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.400]   Yeah, maybe it takes less process or power.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:22.760]   That's for sure.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.520]   Exactly. Go ahead.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.360]   So one last thing on this Elon thing before we move on to something else.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.120]   But like I'm curious how people don't have friends.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.160]   You know, like how does Elon not have some people around him who just take his
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.880]   phone and say you're being a jackass.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.840]   You're not going to tweet for a while.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.480]   Give me that thing.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.240]   You know, like I've got friends around me who would sit me down and straighten me out.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.520]   Leo, I'm sure you do too.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.880]   You know, and everyone else you're debender sure.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.880]   Like, how do you not have friends?
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.840]   It's a Trump.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.400]   Thing.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.880]   It's the Trump problem of like you're you're in such a spot and you're so rich and so
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.960]   successful on the surface where nobody will tell you no and everybody around you is
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.120]   just like trying to, you know, siphon off a bit of that success.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.560]   So yeah, you don't have anybody who can actually tell you the truth.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.400]   That's kind of what I meant when I said billionaires.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.040]   I think that's probably it's probably an occupational hazard of being that wealthy.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.760]   That's why I don't think a billionaire should be president because no one has ever said
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.200]   booed of them.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:16.920]   True.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   We're seeing that.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.760]   We're seeing a fake million.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.200]   He's not really a billionaire, but he plays one on TV.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.080]   A million here.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.920]   It's Halloween.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.200]   We're here in America.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.840]   Don't you think Grimes?
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.000]   Have you met Grimes?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.320]   I bet you have, Shira.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.280]   I actually haven't, although she is Canadian.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.440]   I'm from Montreal.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.320]   But yeah, no, I mean, but she's pretty out there too creatively.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.560]   Yes, she is.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.240]   Yes, she is.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.240]   I could see how they were into each other.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.640]   I just feel like she would be the one who would say something, but probably she's
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.400]   egging him on.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.160]   Or I think he's just doing it on his own.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.920]   I don't know.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.360]   I think he's making his own decision.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.440]   And even someone took one phone away, he'd probably have other things to tweet.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.600]   I mean, I think he's just like he does his own thing because that's he's seen what
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.080]   doing his own thing does the result of that because it's created amazing things.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.400]   So he can't differentiate between the amazing things and the.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.240]   Well, and that's why I'm voting for him because I do appreciate what he's done.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:18.320]   And honestly, Starlink, which is his, I think, the most important project yet,
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.000]   which will give us global high speed internet to every corner of the world.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.760]   That's going to be transformative.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.880]   We can see that now because what would this be like without the internet?
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.920]   There are still half the world is not online.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.840]   What if all the world are online?
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.240]   Alex, do you know anything about the current status?
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.160]   I think they've launched 90 or 120 satellites so far.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.880]   Yeah, they're launching a lot of satellites.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.800]   I'm really excited about this project, something that I'm tracking out of the corner
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.040]   of my eye because space tech for lack of a better phrase in English is super cool.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.240]   You have to be pretty forced.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.000]   422 or up there.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.440]   No.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.400]   Yeah, as a very online person, regrettably, I'm a huge fan of this idea of having
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.160]   internet for everybody fast internet.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.040]   I love it.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.080]   But here's my question.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.720]   Elon is not doing satellites, rockets, cars and solar panels at the same time
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.960]   because he's one person and that's impossible.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.280]   So why can't the people who are running those things run them?
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.920]   Why can't Elon just sit down for a couple of months and get himself together?
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.960]   Because all the products would grind forward well, right?
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.880]   I just I hope you're going to be able to hit a low to unfortunately let go.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:29.280]   If this wasn't a low, the terrible earnings call, the deleted shareholder value,
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.920]   the failure of fiduciary duty, I mean, just go back in time to when you smoke
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.320]   and have blown on Joe Rogan and got into a fight with the SEC.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.880]   Get it together.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.840]   People depend on you that work for you and drive your stuff.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.320]   Like, come on, this is not acceptable.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.840]   It's not middle school when it's cute.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.040]   You get lunched attention.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.280]   You're an adult, damn it.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.040]   It's acting like an eighth grader.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.280]   You're exactly right.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.600]   It's not a crappy eighth grader.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.120]   I said 420.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.560]   I mean, I mean, did he ever did he actually live through being like a full on eighth
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:02.040]   grader? Like if he missed that part of his life, maybe he's just hanging it out now.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.720]   Don't you think sure you get frozen at whatever part of your life you didn't
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.320]   complete so you could move on?
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.960]   I know plenty of yeah or trauma can do it to you.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.280]   Or if you didn't live through it, you're kind of playing it out all the time.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.520]   Play it out until you learn the lesson.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.040]   Right.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.480]   That's why I still have poopy diapers.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.960]   I never got no just kidding.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.760]   Just too much.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.320]   Too much.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.840]   Just kidding.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.400]   Is that why you have the big chair on set?
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:23.800]   Nice.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.440]   You never have to take bathroom.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.720]   It's a terrible image.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.160]   I'm so sorry I brought that up.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.520]   No, I know.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.760]   I'm just came out.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.040]   I'm potty potty trained.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   I forget who did the biography of him, by the way, but I like halfway read that.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.200]   In his family.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.120]   I have a Vats, which is an interview that she's about the thing.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.720]   And you're right, his family life was odd.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.920]   It's families wild and his father's insane, his grandfather's insane.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.280]   So he comes from a line of people of like boundary pushing.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.840]   Folks doing crazy, crazy things.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.600]   So it's like that is his upbringing.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.480]   You know, Steve Jobs, one of the things that made Steve Jobs, I think, so odd.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.200]   And so kind of anti human
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.080]   was that he was he was raised by his adoptive parents.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.800]   Pretty much from the beginning, you can do anything you want.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.080]   You just can do anything you want because you're smarter than everybody else.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.560]   The one time I spent any time with Steve, that just radiated off him.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.480]   I'm the smartest guy in the room.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:31.400]   And in fact, if you if he didn't deem you a one of his, you know, well, you're OK,
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.520]   then he just ignore you didn't exist.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.720]   I was somebody who didn't exist.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.280]   And I think that that's that's an up that's something in your upbringing.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.000]   So maybe Elon just had a poor upbringing.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.360]   And yeah, I'm glad that both Steve and Elon had the freedom because what I see them
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.320]   in them is freedom.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.000]   They were not constrained by what's possible, what you could do, what makes sense.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.400]   They just did it.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.320]   And that has given us a great gift in both cases, admittedly,
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.840]   the huge interpersonal relationships not ideal, but that's a huge gift.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.240]   It's a poor model, though, for a lot of people, because I think a lot of people
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.240]   seized the sea lawn and they go, that's how successful people act.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.600]   Window, it's out to people who are much smarter than you with a much larger resource
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.080]   based did some things.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.480]   It's not to be imitated.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.280]   I think of this new wave of entrepreneurs, my hope is that they can see that they
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:31.200]   could accomplish and do, but also well focus on being and compassion.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.640]   And empathy for others.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.080]   And I think that's that wasn't that's my question.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.360]   That's a good question, sure.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:43.520]   Maybe the people who really changed the world, the PT Barnum's, the Elon Musk's,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.920]   Steve Jobs are not great interpersonally.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.240]   I mean, you know, often they say that people
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:59.520]   by people with bipolar disease, some of the greatest creators and artists in the world.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.880]   Because they were mentally ill, they had all this manic energy at some point.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.400]   And then they and then they crashed and you don't you don't want to breathe that out
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:15.000]   of the genome because that's where the geniuses come from.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   I think you could be mentally stable.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.760]   Go ahead and say Jennifer Alex.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.040]   No, no, sure. Go ahead.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.280]   Oh, I don't think it's about pushing out who you are and your gifts to the world,
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.960]   which means like if you have some sort of disability or if you have something that
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.800]   you just look at as limitation, it's not about taking that away or forgetting that they
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.680]   are erasing it.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.080]   I think it's about figuring out the best way to use that for yourself and as it relates
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.840]   to being of service to others.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.480]   There's a great book, which I read and it looks like Amazon says I've purchased it twice,
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.120]   which shows how man it is called Touch With Fire.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:55.080]   It's by a woman, K Redfield Jamison, who was in fact by polar, diagnosed with bipolar.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.880]   She became a psychologist studying bipolar.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.240]   And the book is about manic depressive illness and the artistic temperament.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:06.960]   And she quote, and she talks about people like Van Gogh and others whose genius.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:12.120]   I don't want to say it was a product of mental illness, but if you cured them.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.840]   Yeah, it's not about being cured.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.640]   I think it's about freedom for yourself and others so that you can
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.040]   you know, bring your expression and your gifts and your truth to whether it be to
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.880]   yourself, your family, your friends or the world, depending on how you want to express that.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.280]   Well, and there's a lot of suffering.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.200]   I mean, Van Gogh suffered by Lord Byron suffered.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.280]   Of course, Virginia will suffer.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.680]   Yeah, challenges lead to to freedom.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.680]   That's true.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.640]   You don't like your challenges are your biggest strengths.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.160]   The worst thing you could be is unchallenged.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.200]   I think so.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.080]   I think by the way, that is that thing for all
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:54.040]   like we're talking about, like the idea that they have been in.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.880]   And by the way, the vendors challenge right now is crappy.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.800]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.840]   Oh, I can't be only hearing every third word.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.400]   And I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.480]   I know I want to hear you.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.920]   Let me do a commercial divinity.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.200]   Do you want to reboot your system?
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.720]   Did you reboot right before you got on?
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.920]   It's it's internet like it is.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.920]   It's the internet in New York because everyone's home and trapped.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.520]   So I will I will just wait it out.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.480]   But let me let me do like a reshuffle and see if anybody's screaming.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.240]   It's working now.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.200]   Go yell at your wife.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.040]   Stop watching Tiger King.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.760]   I want to hear what you're going to say.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.920]   I want to hear what he has to say.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   So let me do a break.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.680]   We'll come back.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.840]   We'll continue this conversation.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.160]   Somebody in the chat room saying do not and I agree with this.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.600]   You're rolling says you're pathologizing people.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.000]   You're treating people like objects by reducing them to their illness.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.600]   And I I don't mean to say that.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.480]   But I do mean to say that.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.920]   I guess what I'm trying to say is neurological diversity instead of
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.200]   say necessarily mental illness or there you go.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.680]   That that neurological diversity is what
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:02.120]   propels us and maybe Elon's particular quirks are what makes it possible for him
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.520]   to change the world.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.400]   You know, I wouldn't want to take that away from him.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.920]   You don't have to be CEO.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.240]   You can be chief technology or something like that.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:10.720]   Exactly.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.560]   Change a job.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.840]   I did not buy a Tesla.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.280]   And by the way, they've been harassing me.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.160]   They say you still have a thousand dollar deposit on a model three.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.640]   Don't you want to buy one now?
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.200]   No.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.320]   No, they're desperate, right?
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.560]   They want to sell those units.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.440]   I think they stopped after April 30th because that was the that was the end of the
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.360]   the quarter.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.440]   All right.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.720]   Well, I'll give you a chance to track down the bandwidth thief,
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.160]   Devinda Harnerwara is here senior editor and gadget.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:41.400]   It's great to have you, Alex Wilhelm, writer for Tech Crunch.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.640]   Great to have you, Alex.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.880]   So nice to see this is fun.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.720]   I love seeing my dear friends and it's been way too long since I've seen sure
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.760]   a Lazar and it's so great to see you and so great to see how well you're doing.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.320]   You're a piece inside.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.880]   I've been watching her crazy vegan cooking on Instagram.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.760]   She sure Lazar on Instagram.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.480]   It's your you're wonderful and it's such a thing.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.880]   I don't know why it's been so long, but we won't we won't let it get this long.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.800]   Yes.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.440]   I apologize.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.640]   Our show today brought to you by a big Barracuda.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.360]   I always want to play the heart song, but I won't because this Barracuda is the
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.760]   provider of cloud enabled enterprise great security solutions.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.360]   And you know what?
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:27.200]   If you are in the biz, you know the name Barracuda, one of the best known names
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.280]   and security protecting email, protecting networks, protecting data,
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.960]   protecting applications.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:39.240]   And right now, Barracuda is your best friend because suddenly businesses have
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:44.040]   hundreds, dozens, maybe thousands of employees working at home,
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:50.400]   getting tons of email every day, but without the protection that they had at work.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.560]   91% of all cyber attacks start with an email.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.440]   And it was last year that ransomware became the number one cyber crime beating
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.720]   out credit card theft.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.160]   It is getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.080]   And your employees are sitting ducks.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:10.920]   They're at home with no protection, spearfishing, ransomware account takeover,
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:16.040]   conversation hijacking, multiply those by how many employees out there, how many
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.280]   emails a day, one click one click is all it takes on the one wrong email.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.600]   It costs you money, customers and your reputation.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.200]   Barracuda is a great place to go.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.160]   Go to their website, barracuda.com/twit.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.320]   Look at the blog.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.040]   They've got great posts about the issues you're facing.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.880]   We're all facing.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:40.320]   They've been observing a big spike in spearfishing attacks related to coronavirus,
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.560]   667%, 667% increase since the end of February.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.320]   Of course, the bad guys jump on disaster.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.280]   They say, ah, it's opportunity and they're going after your employees.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.720]   I want to tell you about one of the things Barracuda does.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.560]   It's really great.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.040]   They call it total email protection.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.160]   If you use Microsoft Exchange,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.080]   this is a way to protect your inbox in the inbox of your employees, even if they're
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.960]   working at home, all in one email security.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.160]   It also includes backup and archiving.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.640]   Of course, you still have even though your employees are at home.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.400]   You still have that legal responsibility to keep those emails for some period of
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.880]   time, sometimes as long as seven years, depending on what you do.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:30.080]   AI based protection from spearfishing, from account takeover, from business email
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:34.320]   compromise, you want that too because you can write rules, but it's changing all
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:41.720]   the time. So AI protection is getting smarter, always adjusting as the attacks mutate.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.720]   They have an automated incident response that gives you options to quickly and
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.120]   efficiently address attacks.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.560]   If you've got employees at home, they're getting email.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.280]   You got to protect yourself.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   Barracuda also offers security awareness training that they can take at home to
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.320]   educate your workforce.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.040]   So employees know their responsibility.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.160]   They are the first line of defense against attacks.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.440]   They want to protect your company just as much as you do, give them the tools they
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.640]   need, give them Barracuda total email protection.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.160]   There are, I mean, I've seen emails out there impersonating the World Health
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.080]   Organization, your company is probably getting spearfishing attacks and
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.440]   personating you and personating the boss, the managers, the owners.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.880]   They use domain spoofing.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.520]   Some of these attacks promise, you know, things that your employees want, like
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.080]   coronavirus information.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.400]   The whole idea is to trick users into a fishing scam.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.040]   And that's bad for your business.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.240]   Ensure the safety and security of your business.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:42.280]   Barracuda total email protection to uncover the threats hiding in your inbox.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:49.680]   Get a free right now secure email threat scan of your Office 365 account risk free.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.960]   So this is just something they're giving away right now.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.760]   Barracuda.com/twit.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.240]   B-A-R-R-A-C-U-D-A.com/twit.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.920]   Barracuda, your journey secured one of the best names in the business.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.720]   Thrilled to have them as a sponsor.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.800]   Thank you, Barracuda.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   Thank you for taking advantage of this.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.640]   Barracuda.com/twit.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.760]   I'm in the comments, Leo.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.440]   There's some interesting things happening.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.600]   Oh, really?
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.120]   Well, yeah, I just wanted to get someone.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.760]   I think that, you know, when we talk about mental health and people that.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.080]   You're looking at the chat room, you mean?
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.480]   Yeah, I just think it's interesting because someone who autism doesn't create a lack
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.360]   of empathy, and that's true.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.240]   We don't want to create any sort of...
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.800]   I don't want to.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.840]   You're right.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.480]   I don't want to.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.440]   I don't want to.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.840]   It's not about judgment.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.440]   In fact, it's quite the opposite. It's saying that we shouldn't reject neuro
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.880]   diversity, neuro diversity, just because it's not like us.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.400]   There's a lot to be said.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.400]   We're just staying at the level of a CEO and someone that is responsible like that.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.320]   Like, there's a lot of things to take into account.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.320]   So our hope is that someone would have the self-awareness to realize that it's
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.960]   more than just about them.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.560]   That's it.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.040]   I think.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.320]   Should the board do that, Alex?
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.320]   Why isn't his board do something about it?
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.800]   It's hard in Elon's case because he's not just another
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.360]   CEO that was brought into a company like GE that is therefore more
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.320]   replaceable. He is so integrated into the brand.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.280]   Mythos, exactly.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.640]   But if he had better friends back to my earlier point or better advisors or
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.000]   just people in his life who could tell him the truth, having him step down as CEO
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.960]   and take on a role that's better fit to his, you know, honestly,
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.640]   large skill set would I think be very intelligent and better for the business.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.280]   It would make everything better.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.360]   But going back to agreed what we were just talking about, you know,
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.320]   there is a mistaken thought in parts of our society that you have to be
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.680]   somehow tortured or broken or something has been going pretty hard on you to make
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.800]   great art. I don't think that's true or do things of great genius.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.120]   And I always get very sensitive when I hear people begin to kind of say that
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.400]   certain things could lead to moral creativity, you know, and bringing this back
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.720]   to me, sorry, before I did quit drinking, if you're here in the appreciate,
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.560]   you heard a little bit about that.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.480]   Sorry.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.960]   I was worried that my personality was going to change that I wouldn't be able
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.280]   to write, that I wouldn't be funny, that nothing that I liked about myself would
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.960]   persist in a post drinking world.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.360]   It turns out all that was wrong.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:17.880]   And so at least from my samples that have won, you know, a lot of artists think
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.280]   they have to drink to create.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.200]   That's not true.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.400]   Yeah, create.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.520]   Or what if you do the work and work on yourself or find some other options?
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.040]   You're scared. You'll lose the things that you did win in the past.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.600]   But I think it's about like all those things change.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.600]   I think what we've created in the past is awesome.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.760]   And sometimes we get to create it more differently in the future.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:40.080]   So it's like about not being too attached to any of those things that we put out
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.120]   there or that our expressions of ourselves, like we get to attach to those things
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.280]   and we need them for our own identity.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.520]   So I think that's also what's important.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.560]   What am I looking at?
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.000]   One of my divinity.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.840]   Now that you're back, did you you were starting to say something we lost the internet?
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.760]   I don't know if you've if the thought is still there.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.800]   You want to talk about it?
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.760]   I feel like you guys have covered it, but I don't want to do too much like armchair.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.600]   Like I hear so like that's the tough thing.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.920]   But in general, one thing I've heard, by the way, just researching people writing
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:15.160]   about Tesla is that the board seems like they're their friends and kind of handpicked
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.080]   by him too.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:22.280]   So they they're not like maybe doing the duty of protecting the company when
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.880]   I feel like in another company, they would be quick to criticize the CEO for doing
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.760]   anything like that.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.360]   And also for him in particular, like, yeah, he's lived a very unique life.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.320]   And I think that's it.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:38.600]   Like we're seeing how out of touch somebody like Elon is when it comes to dealing
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.800]   with with people and his his workers.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.440]   And I think we're starting to see that change a little with some of the tech CEOs.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.600]   Like I bring up Satya Nadella quite a bit whenever I'm here just because I've
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.720]   been following Microsoft so closely and everything he's done has been really
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.760]   interesting and empathetic and very different compared to like certainly
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.120]   compared to Bill Gates, certainly compared to C bomber.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.200]   So there is a different way.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.160]   I hope more people take it.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.600]   Take a look at that and not the like billionaire who, you know, the hotshot billionaire
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.680]   who's changed the world, but maybe, you know, doesn't quite understand people as well.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.840]   Yeah, Nadella deserves more credit.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.440]   I'll actually get to a great word.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:20.760]   He is an amazing CEO who has taken a company that really could easily have not
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.880]   survived into the 2020s and turn it around and made it one of the big powerhouses
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.800]   of the CRS. So he gets a lot.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.880]   I mean, it's the most valuable company in the world.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.200]   And Satya is more likely to tell you about going for walks and talk about
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.760]   poetry than other stuff.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.360]   And, you know, yeah.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.800]   And people want to work that they want to work for him.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.920]   I think people at Tesla are probably a bit more afraid to be long than people
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.120]   of Microsoft are of Satya.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.160]   Yeah, you know, says a lot about leadership.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:49.320]   Yeah, but we should probably, you know, we should probably talk about TikTok instead.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.680]   I want to.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.600]   TikTok, 2 billion downloads to I didn't even know there were that many people on
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.760]   the internet, 2 billion downloads sets a record for Apple stalls in a single quarter.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:09.840]   Is this TikTok's time is COVID-19 the best thing that ever happened to TikTok?
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.360]   I'm sure Lazar. You're a Tiktoker.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.160]   I am. I was actually on when it was
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.400]   musically before they got acquired by ByteDance and became TikTok.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.400]   I mean, listen, I'm amazed at how I had a resurgence.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.280]   Like, I've never seen a company flatten out in plateau.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.120]   And then with the acquisition, they're able to
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.520]   like build again.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.840]   But I think partially, it's because ByteDance has so much money.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.920]   Like, it doesn't even matter.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.560]   They almost can't fail and they they figured out their groundswell.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.920]   They figured out the audience and then it was like they did pay a ton of people.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:45.040]   I think to get things going, but then once the audience came, I feel like some
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.680]   people were paid. But then at the same time, they would say to people like all
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.880]   the people they would onboard, like celebrities or big companies, they would
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.120]   make sure their videos and they knew they had the audience.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.600]   So it was like, you're going to get a ton of followers and engagement.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.920]   We promise because we're going to put it in front of people.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.560]   But isn't it the case that the best TikToks and the biggest TikToks are not
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.400]   conventional celebrities?
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.600]   Yeah. So I think it's a mixture.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.880]   Like, if you go on your for you, you'll see definitely celebrities and like
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.640]   traditional publishers, like Washington Post.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.000]   I don't know if that would have been just like naturally discovered by a teenager.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.840]   No.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.760]   Do you think they're doing well?
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.040]   But the difference is they did it well.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.360]   They followed the best practices and then TikTok was like, we're going to push you
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.720]   because like if Washington Post does well, well, yeah, we can get like New York
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.880]   times and we can get all these other publishers on.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.200]   So it helped.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.400]   It's a win-win for everyone when you give someone a little boost.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.360]   As long as they're doing it well, they need to be doing good content and they did.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.840]   And then there's also the if you go on your for you page, which is their
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.240]   curated page of stuff that you would like, it is a mixture of everything.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.800]   And really, I would say their algorithm has been really good at that.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.880]   But then there have also been called out from different minority groups and different
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:00.520]   types of people that they've called out TikTok for either a black and brown
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.880]   people, they're not their content not being shown or like if you're a plus size
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.520]   person or like if you have a different type of body that they don't deem as hot
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.400]   or sexy, like it doesn't show in the algorithm.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.640]   So they've been called out by many different groups and LGBTQ plus community as
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.360]   well. So like they need to figure that out.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   It feels like the money and the support by the parent companies are the big key here.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.400]   Like you look at Vine and I really liked Vine as a platform, the sort of like
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.640]   ingenuity that would appear there, but Twitter just didn't have the capability to
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.720]   really push that forward or like the funding or anything either.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.320]   So it is mine.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.880]   It's Vine Redux with music, you know, remixing and a really more powerful algorithm
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.440]   and a whole company like dedicated to making this a success.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.320]   So, you know, it's good for TikTok.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:52.640]   I think Vine proof that this platform, it proved that short, really tiny video
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:56.560]   is really compelling, especially if it's easy to produce and you open it up to
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.520]   people to make all sorts of fun, creative stuff.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.720]   Like that's it.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.600]   We want this.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.280]   We don't want like Quibi or something.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.240]   Right.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.840]   Let's talk about Quibi.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.000]   Oh, Quibi.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.280]   I have something to say.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.480]   So like Vine, Vine made stars.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.720]   Vine made some stars.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.160]   So we get out of nowhere, just their huge stars.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.280]   They've they've I think kind of migrated to TikTok.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.600]   There is also some features of TikTok.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.920]   You give a lot of credit to ByteDance, but people from the outside like me look
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:31.200]   at things like the really easy way to take it to see a video, see what they're
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.640]   doing, copy the soundtrack and do it.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.960]   Little things like that make people more creative.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.720]   I feel like those that there's a UI advantage too.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.880]   It's like the perfect storm.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.920]   It was like the start line for them.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.920]   I think it was like the the platform made sense.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.920]   Like it felt like there was an ease to it.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:56.000]   Like it's the use of music, the use of sound effects, comedy, challenges,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.480]   the mixture between like the discovery slash like being able to follow the people
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.400]   you're following slash then being able to go to the hashtags.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.080]   I think it was just like the.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.040]   All of the above.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.320]   It's the perfect meme generator.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:07.840]   Like that's it.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.040]   You can't be able to copy and repeat and share.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.760]   The thing we know about the youths, they love their memes.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.720]   Love the memes.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.560]   Love them.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.280]   What?
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.200]   What's not just the youths.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.120]   I have a lot of friends in their in their forties.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:20.880]   They love the memes.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.680]   The spicy dank memes.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:25.800]   And I am always surprised by I'm like, where did you find this on the internet?
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.440]   And why did you text it to me?
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.040]   I don't know.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.200]   It's like a 50 year old guy who loves rap.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.520]   I feel like they're trying too hard.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.240]   No, no, yeah, yeah, sorry.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:35.680]   Alex.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.320]   No, go ahead.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.360]   Sure.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.040]   Defend them.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.080]   Defend them.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.720]   No, because if you look at there's a woman that's gone viral for being a vegan
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.160]   tab at the brown and she's in her forties.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.520]   She was in actress in LA.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.560]   We didn't know her until March and she just completely went viral.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.400]   But I think it's a mixture.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.720]   Is that because by dance push to her or because.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.600]   I get a mixture.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.080]   This is the thing.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.600]   I do think you could have talent emerge and bubble to the top.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.520]   That just happens on every platform.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.400]   I think it's a mixture between that and then the algorithm seeing that people
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.360]   are liking it at a certain rate and commenting on it at a certain rate and
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.080]   watching it.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:17.280]   And then if that does get in front of someone at TikTok and they say, wow,
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.200]   this person's amazing.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.440]   They're also in an age demo that we want to cater to.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.360]   Let's like give them some love.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.640]   Let's see if we do put this in the for you page, how many people would interact
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:25.960]   with it.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.120]   But I think once they see no one interacting with it, they're not going to
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.360]   like continue pushing it.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.560]   I mean, I'm looking at the World Health Organization.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.320]   This seems like the least likely.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.760]   They did a whole campaign with them for clean washing your hands.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.960]   But they got one point, eight million followers, five point, two million likes.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.840]   Some of their videos, if this one's been viewed by 12.2 million people,
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.160]   if you're the World Health Organization, you're going, this is the place for us
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.920]   to get the word out, right?
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.520]   Yes.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.320]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.960]   Alex, what were you going to say?
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.840]   Well, I was just thinking about
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.280]   what we said about your old talk.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.840]   Hip friends.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.680]   Well, I think it's I want to explain it to kind of all humans because I'm
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.880]   fascinated by how well Vine did before Twitter killed it, unfortunately,
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.480]   and how well TikTok is done and how they released it, Twitter itself,
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.000]   because they all took something that we already have, videos written,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.480]   whatever, and demanded the absolute shortest version of it.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.240]   And it sparked out really beautifully well.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.720]   YouTube, on the other end of the spectrum, you can do our long videos,
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.600]   documentaries, whatever.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.720]   It's really great for that.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.400]   And then in the middle is Quibi in this weird dead zone of content.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.000]   And I was hoping we could talk about it.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.080]   I want to know why.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.120]   Why Quibi.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.320]   Why?
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.480]   They were going to they were going to launch it right when the economy was
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.880]   wearing and everyone was on the go.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.080]   And instead they launched it when everyone was home.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.760]   Well, they have a choice.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.560]   They have a choice.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.760]   But like it's rough, rough for them.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.480]   So sure, I'm going to put sure on this spot because you're in Hollywood.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.560]   So I'm on the I'm in Venice.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.200]   So I'm a bit of more of a hippie in Hollywood.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.280]   OK, I love Venice, by the way.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:02.600]   Yes, I want we rented a house on the canals there and I just I want to move here.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.800]   I love it. This most beautiful place in LA.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.600]   Anyway, but I feel like because of what's trending and because of your
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.640]   connections, because of you, you kind of do get the Hollywood.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.440]   There is a Hollywood mindset.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.120]   And for years,
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:21.400]   the word convergence, I mean years, like decades, like 20 years,
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.520]   the word convergence kept coming up.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.920]   When is when is Silicon Valley going to meet Hollywood?
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.280]   And when is that convergence going to happen?
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:36.480]   What happened in my opinion is they were very disparate cultures and Silicon
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:42.200]   Valley is YouTube, Silicon Valley is TikTok, Silicon Valley is Netflix is
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.960]   Netflix is very different.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:48.480]   And what Quibi to me was Jeffrey Katzberg, former Disney executive,
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.480]   SKG executive, Meg Whitman.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.960]   There's the convergence.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.120]   She ran HP.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.240]   I guess into the ground into the ground.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.920]   I tried to run for governor.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.880]   I don't know, but I think that's why she's why she's one of the two because
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.040]   it's convergence.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.320]   They still have this company.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.520]   It's like the top person in tech, the top person in Ninja T and media coming
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.160]   together to create the top platform.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.240]   It's high concept, which was what Hollywood does, right?
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.400]   Hollywood is all about high concept.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:23.200]   It's about deals and you get the book deal and you get the merch deal and you
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.360]   get the day, day, day, day.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.040]   And that's how they think.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.080]   And so I think Hollywood's looking at TikTok and they're looking at
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:33.640]   YouTube and saying, crap, you know, these guys, well, we don't really
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.960]   understand what they're doing.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:40.920]   Let's let's deconstruct it, figure it out and compete and compete with them and
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.480]   you get Quibi.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:48.600]   Thing is we saw this with Go90 Verizon trying to do it, right?
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.240]   They were throwing money at people and it just couldn't survive.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.960]   I mean, naturally with the downloads because you got it on your phone,
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.440]   there was a quote, unquote audience.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.000]   There's a difference between an audience and a community.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.400]   Yes.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.400]   Well said.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.760]   And that's what they don't realize.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:07.240]   You can get views anywhere, but like, are they really going to care to be part
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.200]   of something bigger?
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.480]   And that's why I think that's the social community.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:17.640]   Like Netflix shows each, each different shows have fan accounts and now viral
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:24.040]   feeds and they're building like social media accounts for the LGBTQ community.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.880]   And the Black community, that's part of Netflix, like people are coming together
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:32.640]   to connect with how they connect with the show.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:38.040]   So it's now gone from just a platform and delivering a product to a community.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.160]   And it took them how long, but this day and age, we think that everything's going
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:41.880]   to happen overnight.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.400]   And if we have enough money, it can just happen.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.040]   And just like it's not the way it works.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:48.640]   I mean, Netflix for a decade was just, you know, DVDs by mail and then they launched
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.040]   streaming.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.240]   And I remember when that happened, we were all like, how what are we going to do
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.280]   with streaming video?
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.720]   Do we get these two TVs and then like things started happening, right?
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.040]   We got the set top boxes.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.120]   The TV has got software that can actually stream the big thing.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.040]   It goes both ways because Silicon Valley.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.320]   Remember Apple wanted to be the set top box.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:11.440]   That's what's, you know, Apple also, Silicon Valley also wanted to get in that Hollywood
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.640]   game, but there just seems to be this barrier.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.880]   You wrote quit trying to make quibi happen.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.600]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.520]   I love this piece.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.800]   It's a it came out of rage.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:29.680]   It came out of like a lot of different things because I'm I'm also a guy.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.720]   I pay a lot of attention to entertainment, too.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.360]   I review movies, I podcast about movies.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.080]   Entertainment's a big part of like what I do and follow.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.800]   So for me, it's entertainment tech.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.640]   I sat down with Jeffrey Kastenberg and that Whitman at CES to talk about quibi.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:48.960]   And like none of their responses to anything seemed very compelling or interesting.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.640]   I asked him like, who wants this?
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.440]   Who's going to who's going to watch this stuff?
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.280]   I have YouTube.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.280]   We have Netflix.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.320]   We have all these other sources for content.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.600]   And they're like they somehow believe they would be a compelling at third option
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.680]   for a lot of people, something people would pay for to see these tiny shows,
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.760]   even though they have some big names, but the shows themselves, like after I looked
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.680]   at them, they're fine, perfectly fine.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:18.080]   I love Titus Burgess, but it sounds seems somehow seems tone deaf during the covid
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:24.440]   quarantine to be firing food cannons at chefs and have them eat it off the floor.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.560]   And the walls to make it ridiculous.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:31.600]   It is one of those ridiculous, either something you'd expect on like 30 Rock,
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.120]   like just a show that just wouldn't exist.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:39.600]   Yeah, in fact, half of quibi stuff looks like parody of real TV.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.200]   That's what it is.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.000]   That's what it really feels like.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.320]   So then like do you remember vessel?
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:50.040]   Do you guys cover vessel when they tried to do that where they're like, we'll pay
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.920]   YouTuber is half a million to million dollars to get their content early like a
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.880]   week earlier to use early like that.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:57.800]   And even I don't even remember that.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.640]   But I'd look at these companies and go 92, which was created by Verizon,
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.280]   which owns Engadget and TechCrunch.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.880]   So that just lingers out there.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.040]   But these companies can't even name these services properly.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:14.120]   Like go 90 was called that because Verizon they wanted you to go 90 and turn your
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.480]   phone, you know, just turn it sideways.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.960]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.040]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:23.040]   And quibi is quick bites, quick bites of entertainment because that's what I'm
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.160]   asking for, even if we're not being trapped at home.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.800]   Do you think it would have done better if people were commuting?
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.160]   They were on subways and buses and waiting in line.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.600]   I don't think fundamentally better.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.840]   Like if you're on the subway, you don't have steady internet access to watch a
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.480]   streaming video.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.840]   So then you still have to pre plan and download.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:42.480]   You can't like and you can like fave a show and just say alert me when there's
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.920]   a new episode, but doesn't auto download like a podcast.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.360]   Worked like a podcast.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.680]   Maybe that would be better, like a video, good podcast delivery system for video.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.240]   That's something we don't quite have.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.320]   That could be cool, but they don't do that.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.480]   And when you're at home, you can't watch on your TV.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.520]   They just absolutely didn't think about that.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.360]   So that is like the first thing they're going to add is like crumb casting.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.520]   Are they changing that?
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.320]   They are.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:04.960]   They're not.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:08.800]   Yeah, they are, but eventually, you know, that should have been there from launch.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:14.320]   So I was watching like the one of the one of the shows with my wife in front of
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:19.440]   our 55 inch TV, we had to watch on our phone because like there was no way to get
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.160]   to my nose.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.720]   I'm trying to show Lisa.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:22.480]   It's not fun.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:25.000]   I'm trying to cast it and it doesn't go anywhere.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.040]   It doesn't go anywhere.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.040]   Terrible idea.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:32.120]   As much as we're all complaining, like in part, I want them to see seed in a way
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:37.320]   because they spent so much money and there are three quarters billion dollars.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:41.000]   So this is actually real like half of LA is out of work.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.280]   And I do think a part of me could be like resentful and be like, I wish I got
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:44.960]   out of there.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.720]   I tried to get in.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:49.400]   And of course, it seems like, you know, stupid because you have these like really
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.200]   wealthy billionaires just creating something they think that we need and like
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.400]   throwing it in our faces and like eat it, even though you didn't ask it.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.360]   Yeah, it's good for you.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:56.880]   Eat it.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.280]   But on the flip side, quick bite.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.720]   Yeah, if it does do well, that means more people will be hired and more
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.840]   production will happen and more like there.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.800]   That is the positive to it.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:11.800]   I just it's going to be a hard process to win right now.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.360]   I do think it's going to be an uphill battle because once again, they they create
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:20.120]   so much and expect us all to consume it all at once to be a success all at once.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:25.080]   When you look at all the platforms that have become the mainstays, they built us.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:30.280]   It was a slow roll over time, like Spotify isn't what it is today when it started,
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:34.480]   you know, over 10, like 15 years ago or whatever, 13 years.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.920]   And I think of what you do with peace inside life that you could if you could
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:43.920]   quit be you'd pivot right now and you do you do Zoom shows and stuff.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:49.000]   But you somehow you can't because they spent more than a billion dollars for these
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.680]   big moments, two billion and they have more money coming and you can't and you can't.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:57.600]   But Cheryl Azar and her buddies can quickly put out a show that's a Zoom
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.160]   call that fits the needs of the moment.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.720]   And that's what Quibi seems like they can't do.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.240]   What if you were CEO, Cheryl, what would you do?
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:06.800]   Right.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.560]   What what?
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.680]   What would you do? What would you do right now with Quibi?
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.360]   You're in charge.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.880]   I mean, I think it's a mix between all these platforms between the big names and then
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.120]   really like discovering new talents.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.240]   There's no room for that because only big names are on Quibi.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.320]   We're going to have big like programs where it's like, yes, submit your ideas.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:30.200]   Like that's the thing that people don't get the importance of like of breaking talent.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.760]   Like if you look at Orange is the New Black Netflix, it was a breakout show.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.560]   We didn't know any of that talent, the director, the writer.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:37.800]   Right.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:43.000]   Like these platforms have a responsibility to create discovery as well.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.160]   I will correct you there.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.040]   Orange is the New Black came from Genji Kohan.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:46.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.800]   Yeah, Genji is me.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.960]   I didn't know who that was.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.600]   She made we from we.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.640]   She's like very popular shows on show time.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.960]   So it all it all trickles down.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.320]   It's just me sure, but I believe you're wrong.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.640]   I believe that.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.040]   So like I've created the key.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.720]   The key is that they took talent that already existed and like gave her room to flourish.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:03.920]   Right.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.840]   Whereas I don't think Quibi is doing that.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:10.000]   Do you think a lot of these people are just like, got to get that Quibi money, got to go.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.320]   You know, pitch my mind.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.320]   And I know those people and like and also when you pre shoot all the stuff,
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.920]   it's like the balance between like you're not going to figure out what works.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.280]   So you've now got so much money and more.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.920]   I mean, I would say 80 percent or 90 percent might not even work based on what you see.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.720]   Start working.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.240]   So you don't leave any room for error, but they have enough money.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.800]   I mean, they're not out of business.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.360]   They have enough money that they could evolve and pivot.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.120]   Don't you think that they won't be too attached?
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.840]   I don't think it's too late, but I just wonder, you know, it'll take by year two,
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.440]   I think they'll realize if things are about, you know, not working.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.920]   And by the way, I should mention like their key technology is the ability to flip
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.080]   and vertical to portrait mode seamlessly, which it works.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:59.280]   It's a very cool idea, actually, and it works, but I never want to watch anything
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:01:59.800]   in portrait mode.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.440]   Like that's the thing.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.000]   I spent all this money and talent.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.640]   Tom Conrad is the CTO.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.400]   This guy knows streaming media, but yeah, it's a well, not CTO, like product
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.880]   officer, right, but he knows streaming media.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.320]   They have technical talent and they've done something that we've never seen
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.720]   before, but the content is what we care about.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.400]   So I could see them licensing that tech to like YouTube or something, but it's also shot.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.240]   Yeah, it's also it's shot in a different way, too.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.560]   So the directors had to shoot with the idea of framing for portrait and landscape
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.880]   at the same time, which seems super difficult.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.560]   I just it's not good enough to make the innovation.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.920]   I mean, that's the thing.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.320]   I love the innovation around that.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.960]   And actually these days for IGTV, like, and if you're using it for other platforms,
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.120]   you do need to be shooting in portrait and in wide.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.040]   So it's like, I do think that's going to be the future or camera.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.280]   It's going to be both ways when you're shooting for Instagram.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.200]   Sometimes so this is the thing.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.880]   You're shooting a video that's going to end up on YouTube, other platforms.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.280]   Those are wide, right.
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:05.320]   And then if you want to put on IGTV, too, and then we'll Snapchat or do an Instagram
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.600]   highlight and story, you need to be shooting, thinking about wide and vertical.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.360]   And I think I do think that's the future.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:15.080]   So I do think the platform is innovative and the tech is innovative.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:19.440]   Like what you said, I think the ultimately the programming and the audience
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.600]   building is going to take time.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.800]   And as long as they're patient with that and they're honest about their
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.200]   discoveries and what works and what doesn't and moves towards what works,
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.920]   then I think people are going to be forgiving.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.320]   And I do think if they blend in bringing in different communities that aren't just
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.440]   like it's not about just about star power, but actually about like really
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.600]   hunkering down on movements and communities that matter, then they can possibly make
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.800]   a difference.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.480]   OK, I will say I've heard from people within Hollywood, by the way, sorry, sorry.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.200]   Just one quick thing.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.680]   People have been talking saying that this is a service that exists to get non union
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.880]   workers on board making shows because these things are so short.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.600]   So that's maybe there's something within like contract work where you, if you're
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.720]   making a 10 minute show, you're not making an episode.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.280]   Therefore, or union terms don't apply or something.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.080]   But yeah, go ahead.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.480]   I hope that's not the case.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.280]   So I didn't talk for a little bit there because I was fascinated by the conversation,
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.280]   but I want to jump in on the financial point about licensing the tech, how it's going
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.280]   into this business and that sort of thing.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.760]   I see zero percent chance that they can generate enough revenue as a software
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.000]   company, licensing, their flipping technology, which I just saw this screenshot.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.360]   That was super cool.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.480]   I would use that, but I wouldn't pay for it to enough revenue to justify their
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.840]   valuation and the capital that has gone into this business.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:37.160]   And the other thing that we're talking about a lot is time, time to find new
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.000]   shows, time to find new audiences, time to find new stars, new actors and directors
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.720]   and so forth.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:47.160]   They don't have a lot of that without more money coming in in nine figure
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:47.760]   increments.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.520]   And if you blow your launch and you don't drive a lot of early subscriptions,
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.680]   when they're free for I think three months, you don't have a leg to stand on.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.240]   And so I'm concerned that the next check might not come.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.360]   And if it doesn't come, this whole thing holds pretty quickly and you sell for
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.920]   $48 to Verizon probably, you know, dang, hello, employer.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:10.600]   But like we all saw this coming is the weirdest thing.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.160]   This has been this has been something that we've all known for a year was going
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:13.920]   to struggle at launch.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.320]   And here it is, struggling at launch.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.360]   I'm not even someone who's focused on, you know, streaming media per se, but
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:24.360]   I don't I don't recall any single person I read on Twitter, the news industry,
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:28.600]   whatever, that was positive about this pre launch and sadly it seems to be correct.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.280]   You know, now that it's kind of here,
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.440]   load early and also they're going to fail upward.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.600]   My two favorite phrases.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.280]   Well, how I guess, sure.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.640]   Holly would have hit driven business, right?
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.840]   That's how Holly works.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.560]   I expect every movie to be a hit.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.840]   True, but they this is like they spent so much money on this and they raised so
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.040]   much money in the end.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.360]   Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman will be fine and they'll end up getting acquired
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.400]   by one of their friends and they'll fail upward, meaning like that.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.080]   It's not like you're going to fail and then they're going to not be able to try.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.040]   I'm not worried about their financial status.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:02.880]   Right.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:09.640]   But they may also be saying, look, when I was at Disney, not every movie was a hit,
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.560]   but the hits that were big made paid for all the rest.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:16.600]   Maybe they're just holding out for the hit and they don't have it yet.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.160]   But I'm not surprised.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   Apple doesn't have a hit yet on Apple TV plus either.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:21.680]   More.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.360]   What about the morning show?
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.240]   Well, the difference is that Apple has
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.040]   several hundred billion dollars of cash in the bank and you know,
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.400]   enormous operating cash flow per quarter.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.680]   And I just can't figure out where Quibi is going to stand up because, as we said,
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.720]   TikTok has two billion downs in the last quarter.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.360]   Leo was shocked.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.920]   There's so many people online.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.320]   That is people came out of the product,
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.560]   we're going to invest it and so forth.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:42.960]   And we have long form stuff.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.000]   We love Netflix, Amazon Prime, all the other stuff.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.800]   Quibi is just in this weird zone.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.880]   We don't need it.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.040]   You're right.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.800]   They also it's a disadvantage because in order to take advantage of their one
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.480]   cool technology feature, you have to I don't know, you have to know what you're
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.840]   doing. You can't, you know, some 14 year old can't just do a video.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.760]   And honestly, these days, that's that's a detriment.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.640]   You need to be able to get everybody creating.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.200]   You also can't share anything.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.200]   You can't share screenshots.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.360]   You can't share video clips.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.280]   Like it's such a weird, closed off system.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.480]   It's Hollywood not.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:17.080]   So that's exactly why convergence never happened because Hollywood is so scared
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.840]   of technology and piracy and sharing and they hate that.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.840]   And Silicon Valley knows that's how you make it.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.800]   And they're never the twain shall meet.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.680]   They just they don't trust each other.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.680]   I feel like you either need to decide as a platform if you're going to be a lean
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.080]   back or lean in and interactive.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.360]   And if you're trying to be both, it might work against you.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:38.160]   I couldn't I couldn't decide whether to lean back or lean forward.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.880]   But then when they launched the food
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:46.880]   and I leaned back, but but then murder house flip, I had to leave forward.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.280]   That is truly a good concept of insanity.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.680]   Yeah, it's totally out of 30 rock.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.480]   So I didn't watch all the shows.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.560]   I tried to Chrissy Teigen as Judge Judy was.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.840]   I don't know who would watch that if you want Judge Judy, you watch Judge Judy.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:07.160]   I don't like to watch a reality show of Chrissy Teigen and talking a legend.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.360]   I don't want to watch her necessarily as a judge.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.240]   That's just their YouTube channel, right?
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.600]   Like that's what Will Smith is doing.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.960]   That's what everyone like all their fun stuff is on YouTube.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:20.000]   Well, they got to be looking at John Krasinski's some good news.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.120]   Yeah, going.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.360]   Why not us?
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:26.840]   I mean, here's Quibi spent a hundred almost two billion dollars.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.720]   John Krasinski's got sock puppets and a globe.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.000]   And he's got many probably many more views.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.560]   I would guess many more views.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.720]   He's certainly much more popular.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.600]   But we don't know how well Quibi's doing.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.800]   Maybe we're all wrong.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.840]   Maybe Quibi's doing great.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.320]   Maybe everybody's the I mean, we saw from the stats, like it fell from the top
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.240]   downloads list pretty quickly, like it slipped down quickly.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.120]   So that much we we know it's not like popular download wise.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.280]   Yeah. So what's all.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:58.040]   Androids doing well because they're on T-Mobile.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.480]   Ah, so you get it.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.920]   You just get it.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.000]   So what?
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.880]   Shira is the real story behind some good news.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.840]   You must know that.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.800]   Oh, well, no, he started this in quarantine, which makes it like such a good story.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.520]   It's in reaction to what's happening.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.760]   And that's why like phenomenon or movement start when it just feels like it
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.080]   emerges out of the.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:18.920]   It's right.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.160]   Yeah, out of what the consciousness or like what's happening right now, it feels
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.800]   authentic and it's so authentic.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.400]   And then the thing is it just feels like he creates it himself.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.600]   Like it just it is him at home, which anybody who knows as you very well,
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.800]   know how hard it is to do content knows very well.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.720]   It's got a team of dozens.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.480]   I mean, you know, someone like I'm thinking about like who's editing this
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.800]   because they're making it look like not professional.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.840]   Well, it is professional.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:45.480]   Exactly.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.520]   Fine balance.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.560]   It's hard to do.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.080]   Your sketches and like their video segments are just as good as late night shows.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.880]   Yep.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.080]   Yep.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.680]   So I'm going to figure it out.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.320]   I read an article that said his manager saw a thought of it and called John and
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.600]   they whipped it together in a couple of weeks.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.600]   I think there's more to it than that.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:08.720]   Boys, I thought that probably John Krasinski's been telling his manager for
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.080]   three years, get me a late night show.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.760]   I want a late night show.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.200]   I should be on a late night show and they thought, Oh, here, what we'll take it.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.360]   We'll do this because it's better.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:18.800]   It is.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.920]   It's he should have a late night show.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.920]   He's brilliant.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.440]   That's fine.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.960]   I mean, like it's also seems like he's been pushing away from the gym, the office
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.360]   identity for so long because he's been taking all these action roles.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.080]   Brian role doesn't fit him.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.080]   He is Tom Hanks.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.040]   He is the next Tom Hanks.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.360]   He's the nice guy, the every man.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.080]   And the place, which I think surprised us that he could write it.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:41.960]   Yeah, it's good director.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.680]   You know, star and something like that.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.880]   So I think that's good.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.600]   I want to throw a shout out to the late night show so because I do love how they
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.080]   adopt the zoom and the remote recordings.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.880]   And like they're doing it in such fun ways.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.080]   I love Conan and Brian.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.600]   He is doing a phenomenal job with that.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.360]   And even Colbert, like they got him a proper, you know, Sony production camera,
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.240]   it's still feels a little off the cuff, which I think we can all relate to.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.160]   We're all a lot of people are stuck out.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.720]   We're not all stuck at home, but the people who are can feel like, oh, man,
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.360]   they're trapped just like we are.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.280]   It's a measure of the fee there.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.080]   And so this is, I don't want to put down.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:22.160]   There is real talent in Hollywood and it's a measure of the very real talent that
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:26.040]   they were able to do something that, you know, is so different from what they did.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.120]   And at first, I have to say it was a little hollow watching John Oliver without
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.240]   the audience till the same jokes.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.640]   They felt boom.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.960]   They thought it super flat, but they learned.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.000]   Yeah, it got better and better.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.600]   The writers learned the producers learned.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.320]   And so that's where you do see there is something to be said for real talent.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.440]   And Hollywood's got that.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.680]   I don't want to put them down at all.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.480]   Yeah, there's real talent everywhere.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.560]   Just a matter of you going to like say that it is only matters because I put a ton
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.960]   of money against it or you're going to say like doesn't mean I know everything.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.280]   Yeah, you can't deny the quibby's well produced.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.120]   Beautiful. Yeah.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:06.040]   Yeah, almost too well produced, which is the weird cognitive dissonance I saw too.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:10.320]   Like if I'm watching vertical video, I expect it to look like a YouTube video
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.920]   for Instagram live or something like expect that.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:18.120]   If it looks like a slickly produced Hollywood show, it just feels wrong in a weird way,
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.280]   too. So I don't know how to describe that except like pure media dissonance for me.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.520]   What do you think of Snapchat and the way they do vertical shows because they've
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.800]   been killing it actually with well, none of us really know that.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.840]   Like the CPMs and money that people are getting on Snapchat is amazing.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.680]   Like Will Smith started Will at home.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.920]   So like, why does that work versus this possibly?
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.240]   I mean, Snapchat was natively portrayed to you, right?
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.960]   Like that's what their audience learned and understood.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.160]   And they had to build up to that like you were saying, like it had to build up to
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:52.280]   being able to produce these original shows after everybody was using Snapchat.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.120]   Right.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.280]   Just think how great Snapchat would have been if they had said go 90, turn it, turn it, turn it.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.480]   Turn it, turn it.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.680]   Turn it.
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.360]   We can start with a song.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.640]   Turn it, turn the video, turn it.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.560]   You know, Snapchat's a really, really, really good example.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.920]   And I think Quibi really wants to be snap.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.560]   That's really what they wanted to be.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.800]   And it's a great example of how being sensitive to the culture and the style and
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:21.000]   the feel and the audience is an absolute requirement.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.040]   You can't just march in and say, we're going to take it.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.520]   Well, we make great movies.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.000]   We know and great TV shows.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.480]   We know how to make great content.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.120]   We're going to make it seven minutes long and vertical.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:30.960]   Watch.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.680]   And it's like, look at, look at Facebook, original shows, like they threw in so much
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.600]   money as well.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.600]   And the only show that ended up doing well and is now something bigger is Red
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.920]   Table Talk, like out of all their shows, that shows the percentage chance of a show
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.160]   making it and hitting it.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.960]   How many, how much money did they spend?
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.480]   It was like one show that now will be sustainable.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:53.920]   It's good.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.760]   I'm glad we have Devindra and Shuram because you both in different ways,
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:01.080]   are you paying close attention to this stuff?
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:07.000]   Now it's your turn, Alex Wilhelm, because it's quarterly report time.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:11.840]   Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.560]   Here, I thought we would have given what was the volatility on the stock market.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.920]   I thought we were going to get these horrific quarterly reports.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.960]   But we didn't.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:28.520]   Apple, $58 billion in revenue, only up 1% but up is up.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:33.840]   Alphabet grew more than expected in Q1, a little bit of a dip in ad business.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.200]   We knew that would happen.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.200]   Facebook says significant reduction in demand for ads, but their stock still went up,
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.360]   up, up.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:47.240]   Twitter sales up 3%, $808 million.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.120]   So tell us you got a parses for us, Alex, because as you can see, as a layman,
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.240]   I don't know what I'm looking for or what I'm looking at.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.400]   Is it too early to see the COVID hit?
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.760]   So what we're seeing is the first quarterly earnings that include a bit of
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.000]   COVID, so we're seeing kind of March from these, you know, generate for very
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   March earnings showing some impact.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.400]   More important was what the company said about what was coming next.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.840]   And we saw a lot of the reactions more based on what they said was going to
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.360]   happen the rest of the year than what happened kind of in Q1.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.600]   So for example, Facebook said we took a hit in March, but in April,
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.480]   things are roughly flat from a year ago.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.520]   Wall Street said, OK, Twitter said we took a hit in March and things are still
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:33.880]   kind of bad in April, meaning that growth is going to go down or go negative.
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.440]   Twitter fell pretty sharply.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.400]   So the way people are talking about forecast is what matters the most.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.840]   But there's always a bit of nuance in these in these reports.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.800]   It's fun to pull out like Apple grew 1%, but it made a lot more revenue off of
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.560]   services, which is kind of its 13 million dollars.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.000]   Yeah, 13 billion in change and it's less hardware revenue.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.160]   So we're seeing Apple make less money from selling iPhones and more money from
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.200]   some iCloud storage.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.680]   I think they've been trying to do for some time now services are supporting the
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.840]   business and keeping it in positive growth territory, even though it's selling
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.560]   fewer iPhones.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.840]   Cool. In other words, Apple executed properly.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.000]   They did exactly what they wanted to do.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.560]   It's been a long time coming.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.600]   It's a long term bet.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.360]   It's going to take them several more years to get those revenue lines, anything
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:20.000]   like in the same, you know, area size, but certainly say it in this quarter.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.920]   In Alphabet's case, the ad business struggled some, but there was much funnier
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.560]   things to be found.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.800]   I mean, for example, other bets, which is the collection of alphabet stuff that
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.640]   isn't Google, so it's revenue decline year over year and also lose 1.1 billion
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.000]   in the quarter, which I thought was really, really funny.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:35.800]   Haven't they?
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.320]   I mean, they're not money maker.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.080]   It's got worse.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:38.640]   No, no, no.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.680]   The revenue went down.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.280]   The losses went up, which I thought was particularly.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.720]   Who are going to be the winners in COVID Netflix?
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.240]   Huge.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:51.080]   Facebook should be a winner, except that revenue will be down, but certainly
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.000]   audience, their daily active users, 1.734 billion.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   Wow.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.600]   That's a stounding.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.480]   No, I absolutely astound.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.120]   Daily.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.000]   Well, Amazon, B, that's a good question, Shira.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.400]   Well, yeah, after the latest news, it went down, but wasn't it up?
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.120]   How is Amazon fairly fair?
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.640]   I mean, everybody's I've been ordering more on Amazon.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.360]   Amazon shares went down after they said they were going to spend $4 billion
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.480]   in the current quarter on COVID related costs.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.920]   But what you have to keep in mind is that was like a week of gains that they gave
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.320]   back.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.560]   So they're not really down.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.600]   They haven't really lost a lot of altitude.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.800]   Amazon's doing incredibly well as it has done since I started paying attention
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.440]   to stocks.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.160]   So that's not really much of a surprise.
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.520]   That's a company that can pivot pretty quickly and take advantage of a moment
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.040]   and as an organization do well.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.720]   So you got to get points for that.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.720]   You know, they do something they rarely do, which is they miss their estimates.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.440]   They did.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.960]   And especially on the profit side.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.680]   That's unusual because don't they control that doesn't?
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.680]   I always feel like Bezos has a knob in the office that he can turn.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.040]   Right.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.480]   I imagine more money this quarter.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.800]   I make a little less money this quarter.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.000]   I think any company.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:01.600]   Go ahead.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.400]   Please.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.840]   No, any company supporting remote work and remote learning to, I think, has a lot to get.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.960]   So I did.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.120]   Well, I followed Microsoft's earnings because I'm.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.000]   Just that's my beat and they were up 15% over that quarter or two.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.200]   So their business is doing great when it comes to office and cloud storage and things like that.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.000]   And it's been a good time for Twitter, right?
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.920]   We're all turning to Twitter more than before.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.320]   I don't know about earnings, but the daily active users want.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.040]   Now, for some reason, they have something called monetizable daily active users.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.280]   Does that mean non bots?
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.520]   I don't know what that means.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.840]   We can make money on these guys.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.440]   I don't know.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:44.960]   I don't know.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:45.600]   That's it.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.200]   Is that Alex?
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.400]   Is that a is that gap monetizable daily active users?
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.840]   That's the inverse of gap.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:57.760]   Whatever gap is gap is an acronym G A A P generally accepted accounting principles.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.840]   When you make up your own metric, DAU, and then you add another kind of adjustment to it,
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.080]   you're going to be off the farm and down.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:04.960]   Our MDAU does.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:08.680]   24% year over year.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:15.360]   Partly because of the global conversation related to the COVID-19 pandemic,
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.040]   it's their highest reported year over year growth rate to date.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.520]   14 million MDAS added.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.760]   I really want to know what unmonetizable.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.320]   I think you're probably right, Leo.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:30.240]   It is not like it's a lot of things because we are assess is effectively dead as a platform.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.520]   People use Twitter for that.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.480]   Also, I was going to say as someone who has monetized on Twitter before,
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:44.880]   we would have videos that were original videos that we could monetize and then content we couldn't monetize.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.400]   So like, you have some, yeah,
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:53.200]   you could have some stuff that you're pushing out that is just content has impressions and views and following.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.560]   And that could be against that, but then we can't monetize that.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.800]   So that's unmonetizable.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.680]   You're talking about the periscope and the live videos that kind of.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.880]   No, like the actual on like our just content we post.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:08.160]   I might one of our YouTube videos on what's trending will post it on Twitter.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.800]   We can monetize the ones that are appropriate that are.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.480]   Oh, interesting.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:18.080]   Advertiser friendly, but the ones that might have a swear word or ones that we might pull from like a meme or whatever.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.000]   We can't monetize that because it's not our content.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.400]   So it's unmonetizable.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.480]   So you could say like the monetizable is that right.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.880]   So there's a lot on Twitter, a lot of content on Twitter that can be monetized.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.520]   We know.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:35.520]   And I have a lot of content on Twitter.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.520]   And I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.720]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.400]   And I lost track of where I was at.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.320]   I said, I lost track and my editor.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.520]   It's going to be on the show.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:05.920]   Oh, that's a big fight.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.120]   That's an FCC.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.720]   I guess you're not.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:09.720]   No, we are.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:14.320]   We're in 36 markets on HD 2 and AM and all that.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:17.320]   And we got a call from our bosses on Friday night.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.720]   I trust him a lot of money.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:22.120]   It said I'm hoping that no one calls in for that.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.520]   But like that was a mistake.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.320]   You could see that I was making a mistake, but someone ended up putting it in.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:29.320]   That's the thing is you're going to have all these mistakes from this type of work
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.720]   because we're all like doing the work in ways and processes that we weren't doing it.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.120]   So do you play music?
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.520]   What do you do on your afternoon show?
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.720]   It's a music talk station called Channel Q.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.720]   It's the first LGBTQ plus music talk station.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.520]   So it's on it's part of radio.com.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.520]   Yeah, which is an app.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.920]   And so we're it's called Channel Q is the station on radio.com.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.320]   Do you say things like you're driving home, Misha?
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.120]   On a perfect Wednesday afternoon.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.320]   Yeah, it's it's actually what's cool is there's very few stations that have a mix
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.320]   between music and talk, but we actually talk about current events, social issues.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.320]   We have a few people listen to that.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:02.920]   That's great.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.720]   Yeah, and then it's also available as a podcast.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.920]   If you go on radio.com and search let's go there with an apostrophe like let's go there.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.320]   They need to fix that.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.120]   We post all our episodes there.
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:16.720]   So a lot going on, but yeah, that I just thought it was funny because I realized how I have such a potty mouth.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:21.320]   You know, potty mouth sounds weird, but I just I do swear.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.720]   I swear I'm fine.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:30.320]   I have to my wife, the beautiful Lisa has the most the worst.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.120]   I mean, the worst every other word is the F word and which is fine with me.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.320]   It doesn't bother me, but as you know, I am on the radio.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:42.120]   So I endeavor not to use any of that language.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:47.520]   And so it's an interesting mix where I'm saying, shut the front door and she's saying, shut up.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.720]   Anyway, you get the idea.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.920]   I think I lose something in that in that mix.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:23:05.320]   I need to put the link in because we don't get our we don't get our views like because radio.com is so kind of again, like we're on iTunes, but they're Apple, but they want us to get the radio.com. Listen, so I'm going to put in the radio.com link.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:08.120]   We are channel Q dot radio dot com.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:16.120]   Listen, what time we want to three or seven PM four to seven four to seven live on weekdays and then the podcast to be.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.120]   Do you on the east coast to be seven 10 or do they tie?
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.520]   No, it would be OK.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.720]   Yeah, it's seven to 10 PM.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.320]   He's a real live.
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.320]   Yes.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:23.920]   Awesome.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.120]   I'm going to listen to your show, man.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:31.120]   Yeah, during my commute from the bedroom to the living room.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.320]   It's a short commute.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.520]   Yeah, I'm putting the living.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:40.120]   So actually that's another company that's doing very well spotify right now.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.920]   A lot of consumption.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:46.520]   They said every day is a weekend now when it comes to spotify listening.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.320]   Every day is a weekend.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.920]   They it sounds good until you think about why.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.120]   Yes.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:59.720]   A hundred thirty million paid users up thirty one percent year over year.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.520]   Two billion in revenue, which sounds for something with a hundred thirty million paid subscribers.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.520]   A little low to me.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:16.120]   They are making a big podcast push, which I'm going to be interested to see how they treat that because I still feel like we're waiting.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.320]   We're waiting for podcasts to really become huge and consumable and everybody understands.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.120]   I think someday podcasts are going to be something.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:30.720]   Meanwhile, they spend two hundred thirty million dollars on gimlet media.
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:35.120]   They spent north of a hundred million dollars for Bill Simmons ringer.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.720]   They've spent a lot of money.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.920]   I think Daniel likes that they were prepared to spend half a billion dollars on podcast acquisitions.
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.320]   They bought anchor FM.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.720]   Spotify said podcast listening is still growing.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:53.320]   Now tell me Alex, doesn't that sound when you hear still growing?
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.320]   That doesn't sound real good.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:58.320]   No, because they would tell us if it was impressive.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.320]   Going back to what we said about it.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.320]   We said we don't know how they're doing because they haven't released numbers.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.320]   They would have released numbers if they were good.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.720]   Here's the always the case.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:11.520]   Podcast listening is still growing with ninety percent of monthly active users engaged with that content.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.320]   Whatever the hell that means.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:17.520]   Up from sixteen percent previous quarter.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.520]   I don't know what engaged with content even means.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.520]   No, is that five seconds of a listen is it fifteen seconds?
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.720]   The show is it's three shows.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.120]   I mean, it's a special question.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:30.720]   More and more of these like autoplayed playlists too, which I find kind of interesting.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:37.520]   Like if you start driving, there's a playlist like I'll auto generate music and shows for you to listen to based on your preferences.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.720]   Does that what people want?
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:39.920]   Do you think people want that?
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.720]   I don't.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.320]   It is hard to find good content.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.720]   Like that's a thing and I don't know.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.720]   It's got a reason to be able to do it.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.320]   We're there.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:53.520]   Wasn't there something that came out that said the podcast listening was down during the time?
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.920]   So we've seen it.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.520]   I can just tell you from our own experience.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.120]   Initially it dropped.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.520]   We're not a news podcast.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.520]   I'm sure the daily and personal the news podcast.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.120]   A slate says they're up thirty percent.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.320]   So I'm sure those went up at first.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.920]   But I think after a while, I don't know my experience has been.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.920]   OK, I got it. I don't want to listen to this 24/7.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.320]   So our numbers started trending back up.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.120]   I think we've regained anything that we lost and they still seem to be going up.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.720]   So I think what I feel we lost is the commute.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:29.720]   So like any radio show, like any audio only content people listen in the car.
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:34.320]   So since a lot of our audiences no longer commuting, I imagine that hurt us.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.720]   But I also feel like and this reflects, I think, the maturity of the medium now.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.720]   Because you can listen on your Echo.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.720]   You can listen in a lot of different ways.
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:47.720]   I think people are listening at home, which is something they never used to do.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.120]   Radio was all in car for the last thirty years.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.120]   It's been all in car.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.920]   So it seems to be going up a little bit.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:01.520]   I think also podcasts like ours where it's friendly, familiar voices talking about stuff you're interested in
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.720]   are in higher demand as we get more and more isolated and lonely.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.120]   So I don't know.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.320]   That's one thing.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.920]   I also say like the move towards wireless headphones has made so much of it so much easier to like.
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:20.120]   I'm not the biggest wireless earbud fan, but it does make the convenience of just popping something in your ear,
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.320]   having it as you're doing.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.120]   I do walk around with my earbud.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.520]   Yeah, I have it on all day.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   So I think the rings were go ahead.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.320]   Oh, sorry, Leo, please.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.520]   Oh, just think that the I'm going to say it's bullish.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:37.320]   I don't know if Spotify will make its half billion dollars back, but I'm going to say podcasting is doing.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:37.720]   Okay.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.720]   During this.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:39.920]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.720]   Well, we are like everybody else, including Spotify, where advertisers are drifting away.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.320]   Advertisers are not buying ads because they because they see the economy tanking.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.120]   Yeah, they don't see sales.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.720]   So they're thinking, you know, we only for it.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:56.720]   I'll give you a good example.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.720]   This show normally has four ads and this show is our premier show.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.920]   So we charge the highest CPMs for this show.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.520]   We only have two today.
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.120]   Yep.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.720]   So that'll give you some idea.
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.320]   That's a fairly hefty.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.720]   Yeah, reduction in revenue for us.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.920]   I'm worried about what that's going to mean for the industry as a whole.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:17.720]   Like my movie podcast show, we we still have ads, but we are doing kind of like free.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.120]   Yeah, we're doing a lot of bonus.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:22.320]   Yeah, to keep the person around, basically.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.720]   So wow.
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.320]   Yeah, I don't know what this means for new and upcoming shows for sure.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:29.320]   It's tough all round.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:33.120]   I mean, if you're there's so many restaurants in the Bay Area that have now closed for good.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.320]   They're just not going to come back.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.720]   I'm sure that's true in Brooklyn.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.120]   I saw that.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:40.120]   Cafe, both LA just closed.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:40.720]   I mean, it's just.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:41.920]   Oh, no.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.320]   Yeah, there's a lot.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.320]   Yeah, it is sad to see that it is.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.720]   And I think brands, even bigger brands, they're just saving their money because they don't know what the quarter is going to be like.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:53.920]   What's coming up or what they're going to have to market by the way their marketing goals are changing.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.720]   We have new commercials that we've never seen.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:58.720]   We have products that they might start launching that they're figuring out.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:04.120]   I mean, the world is going to be very different when we come out of this.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.720]   And also we don't even know when we're going to come out.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:07.920]   Out of this.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.320]   So that's going to be interesting.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.920]   It'll be the world of demolition, man.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.920]   Basically, we just reviewed that and it is weird how prescient that whole movie.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:15.920]   Watch it again.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.920]   Yeah, the whole movie they don't have they don't have antics because it's a no-tilt culture.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.320]   There was some sort of pandemic.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:21.920]   I'm interested.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:26.920]   Taco Bell is the only restaurant because all the other restaurants closed or got eaten up or bolted.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.920]   So yeah, that movie works.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:31.120]   What about idiocracy?
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.720]   Yeah, we're also there.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.920]   Also, they know not a perfect movie.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:40.320]   Pressing movie to not watch idiocracy unless you really it's too real.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.520]   You do not want to be bummed out.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.920]   By the way, when he says we he's talking about slash film, which is an excellent podcast.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:50.520]   And you're you know, I bet you have a bigger audience now because people are desperate for something to watch.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.120]   They're trying to figure out what's good.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.720]   So slash film is perfect.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.920]   So say the slash film cast and slash film.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.920]   Com has its own like daily podcast as well.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:04.920]   But I don't I don't know if our numbers are any better, but I hope people seem to be like leaning on us as like the comforting voices that
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:08.520]   yeah, in the pre, you know, COVID era, something they can go back to.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.720]   And yeah, there's our last year.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.120]   Do you like devs?
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.720]   I love that I did.
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.720]   I didn't interview with Alex Garland over in gadget.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:18.320]   I listen to that freakin genius.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.320]   I'm going back and watching all of his movies.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.520]   Everything he's done.
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:31.320]   Also, something most people don't know, he wrote the screenplay for the Never Let Me Go adaptation, which is a fantastic, like fantastic movie, great book.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.720]   But he everything he does is I adore.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:41.920]   Yeah, I was I mean, Alex Garland's been around a lot longer than an annihilation and he's written some really interesting stuff.
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.920]   He's got a very interesting point of view.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:47.120]   So slash film cast.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:47.920]   That's easy.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.320]   Everybody should subscribe.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:56.120]   Everybody should subscribe to peace inside dot live because we need more peace inside.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.320]   Yeah, we do.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:57.920]   Come on.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.120]   Yeah, we're good.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:04.520]   And if we can get a hundred new subscribers in the next 60 seconds, sure will stand up for us.
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.920]   Oh, yeah, I'm surprised.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:10.720]   Alex, Alex, what do you have to plug, Mr.
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:10.920]   Will.
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:16.000]   Oh, it's not really apropos, but I'm also on a podcast called equity with tech
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:16.320]   Runch.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.520]   So if you care about the startup in venture capital world, that is
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.920]   how is that going?
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:21.520]   I'm a week.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.320]   A lot of listeners down about 20 percent.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.120]   Yeah, that's what I think from our pre.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.520]   Well, Leo, you know, we put it out on Monday,
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:33.920]   morning's and Friday morning's designed for people who are commuting to and from kind
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:34.520]   of the work week.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.920]   And so if you time it, you're going to get hit.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:39.320]   But what's really cool is our core audiences stuck around.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:42.720]   And I think the show is getting better because we have been more practice.
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:46.520]   So when people begin to drive again, I think we will be ready to kind of pick that
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.920]   back up, but surviving and doing just fine.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.920]   That's the keys.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:54.520]   You know, if we just make it through, if all of us just make it through a better world awaits.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.320]   Well, if you think of demolition, man is a better world.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.120]   It'll be a very different world.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.720]   And I think we're fundamentally going to live with this stuff.
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.320]   And like, yeah, I think our kids are going to ask or my daughter certainly
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:10.120]   could ask, why do we have a month of food stored in our basement at all time?
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.320]   This is why.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:12.520]   This is why.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:18.120]   I just bought a 25 pound bag of wheat berries and a 25 pound of corn.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.920]   Like a wheat.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:20.720]   A wheat.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.120]   Because you can never have too much wheat.
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:26.520]   You know, when you're a teenager, you get in trouble for doing certain things.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:30.720]   The future will be like, if you get drunk or stoned and eat the stockpile of things.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.720]   Like, yeah, you're in trouble.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.720]   But you know, who's known about this for a long time, the church of Latter-day Saints.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:39.320]   I just I found out recently, well, you're a former.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.120]   Were you a Mormon Alex?
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.320]   No, I was Lutheran.
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.920]   I grew up with Mormon friends.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:51.120]   But LDS has this has been always one of the tenets of LDS is to have a year's worth of supplies
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.320]   ready.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:59.520]   And so there are all over the country these LDS depots you can go to and buy massive quantities
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:04.120]   of foodstuffs, including like 100 pound bags of flour.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.520]   Well, the Mormon faith historically had moved around before it settled.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:12.320]   And kind of its nexus point that we all know now in Salt Lake and the certain areas.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:15.320]   And so they have a history of needing to kind of up sticks and go.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:17.720]   And so their culture that values preparedness.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.920]   And so it's not a surprise that they've kind of maintained that through time.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:25.400]   And after a long time of being kind of on the outskirts of American culture in that way,
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:29.480]   here they are right in the middle of it now because it turns out that we're all preppers
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.840]   and we just didn't know it yet.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:31.720]   We just didn't know it.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:34.040]   They're called home storage centers.
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.120]   Wow.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.000]   And they're near and they're definitely all over the place.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.920]   There's one near us and you're allowed to go in even if you're not a Mormon.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.920]   There are 101 locations across the US and Canada.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:50.720]   But be ready because it's a it's a no frills operation.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.720]   And it's mostly like a hundred pound sacks of flour, as you can see.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.720]   Yeah, but hey, you know, if you need flour, beans, rice.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:01.520]   There's the place to go.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:06.600]   It's amazing. What do you think about the whole garden movement?
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:12.720]   I think that like as food supply changed change change.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:15.720]   We're going to end up like making our own food and just keeping it simple.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.440]   I'm worried about vegetables.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.320]   I'm worried about pork.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.520]   So we bought it.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.920]   And just become a vegetarian.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.400]   We bought a pig and no, yeah, you're right.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:26.200]   I want to be actually dried beans.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.520]   Just get a lot of dried beans.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.920]   I want to I actually we have a friend who does hydroponics and they're in there
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.120]   and they're self-sufficient.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:39.040]   You have fish which poop in the water and that fertilizes the plants, which
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:39.720]   is cool.
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:44.440]   The whole thing is that greenhouse, it's all sealed up and it grows greens or
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:47.960]   whatever Gary, you got to build us our hydroponic garden.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.520]   Because I have a feeling.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:54.600]   I mean, there's been a lot of science writing about just the decline of meat
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.680]   and fishing to you over the next few decades.
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:59.440]   So this will kind of just accelerate all of that.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.240]   But now I noticed, sure, you eat the impossible stuff, the impossible.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:04.880]   I do a bit.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:05.440]   I try not to.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.240]   I know that a lot of people have things to say about that because some of the
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.600]   ingredients aren't the best for you.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:14.080]   So it's I think everything in moderation, like just because impossible is
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.080]   meatless and it's like vegan doesn't mean you have it every day.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.640]   Like I might have it once a week or so.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:20.960]   Right.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.080]   And I like the way it tastes, but it's not it's supposedly like not amazing for
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.000]   you just because it also has stuff in it that.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.360]   If you're going to get something to taste like me, you're clearly going to have
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:32.560]   to do something.
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:36.000]   I mean, you know, there are there's there are a lot of alternatives now.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.320]   So I think it'll be interesting to see that world in the future.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:42.440]   Like I spoke to Mark Cuban this week and on my radio show, actually, we're
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.720]   sharing that tomorrow on the show and he's investing.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:46.360]   He's a vegetarian.
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:50.800]   He's investing on a lot of companies that provide meat alternatives.
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:51.400]   Good.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.080]   And also vegetarian alternatives.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.120]   I don't you know what meat production is tough on the environment and it's
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.960]   clearly tough on the workers.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.400]   It's killing the rainforest.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.920]   So yeah, killing the workers.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.120]   DaVinja, are you a vegetarian or vegan?
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:07.720]   I am not.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:08.440]   I am not.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.880]   I mean, I really believe in the stuff.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.840]   I'm like preparing for the eventuality where I'm going to be eating less meat.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.160]   But now I'm still very credit for it.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.960]   I don't mind not eating meat at all.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.960]   You know, in Canada, they changed the food pyramid because because like if you
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:25.760]   look at game changers on Netflix, oh my God, that is not a great documentary.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:26.360]   I love it.
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.720]   They call game changers of the game.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.200]   It's all these super athletes.
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:31.800]   Or vegan.
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:33.200]   Yeah, or plant based.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.120]   Plant based anyway.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:40.040]   And it really shows that like the whole protein story started out when companies
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:44.760]   started to market on sports because they couldn't market cigarettes anymore.
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.360]   Like and sports shows or TV, you know, like the games couldn't get cigarette
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.840]   ads because that was not it was wrong.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:52.960]   It was illegal to market.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:56.120]   So then the meat industry came in and said like, if you want to be big,
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.720]   if you want to be a man, you need more protein.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.880]   And that was just like this whole story created.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.520]   What if you want to be a woman as much protein?
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:06.560]   Well, yeah, I mean, it was very male centric, obviously.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.800]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.800]   Well, there's lots more to talk about.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:15.720]   I just have a fun hanging out
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.960]   with my friends, Cheryl Azar,
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:26.440]   peace inside dot living with Alice Will help live the live living live live.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.480]   Alex Wilhelm, who is also not wearing pants.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:35.560]   He's with tech crunch, but I'm not asking him to stand up at out and
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.960]   live in the house of vendor Harder War.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.360]   We don't know what he's wearing.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.960]   It's he's a mystery.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.760]   It's a mystery. It's going to stay that way, right?
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.080]   Yes, of course. Yes.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.560]   Our show today brought to you.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.760]   I look what I got here.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:50.560]   Ooh, ooh, it's so little.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.360]   It's so cute.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.560]   It's an iPhone SE and you know, I got it.
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.360]   I got it from the Fox from Mint Mobile.
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:03.360]   This I have to say I, you know, Apple gets a lot of heat for making expensive stuff.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:07.040]   $100 for the iPhone SE is an amazing deal,
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.960]   but I'm going to make it an even better deal.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:14.160]   How would you like an iPhone SE for $15 a month?
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.040]   It's the new Mint Mobile 15 plus 15 deal, $15 a month for the iPhone SE,
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:26.880]   $15 a month for Mint Mobile service, $30 a month total for great wireless service.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.760]   Mint Mobile is amazing.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.760]   And I have to say the carriage is great.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.560]   Unlimited nationwide talk and text.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:38.160]   You get crazy fast 4G LTE.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.360]   Switching is easy.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:42.560]   You can even take your phone number when all your existing contacts.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.360]   Stop overpaying for wireless.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.760]   Save money with the Fox.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:51.760]   Ryan Reynolds Mint Mobile at Mint Mobile.com/Twit.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:54.360]   I think the iPhone SE is a great solution.
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:57.160]   And if you've got family members who need a smartphone,
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.960]   what a great way to get them.
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.760]   Get them going.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:04.960]   $15 for the iPhone a month, $15 for Mint Mobile service a month.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:07.760]   By the way, they are extending.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.160]   And I bet they'll do it again, but right now extending their unlimited data for all.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.560]   Normally you buy packages of data from Mint Mobile, but during the crisis,
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.360]   they are giving unlimited data.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.160]   They started March 15th.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:23.160]   Find out more at Mint Mobile.com/unlimited.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:27.160]   So no matter what package you're signing up for, you get unlimited data.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.560]   I like Mint Mobile so much.
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:31.160]   I ended up getting the $300 a year package.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.760]   So I'm paying $25 a month.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:40.560]   Unlimited nationwide text, unlimited calling and 12 gigabytes of data a month.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.760]   I never use that all up.
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.960]   It's such a great deal for 25 bucks a month.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:46.360]   Cut your wireless bill.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:53.560]   Get their three month introductory plan, $15 a month plus the iPhone SE, $15 a month.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:57.360]   If you, this is a great solution for a kid, for a parent.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:03.760]   You want to stay in touch, do FaceTime with them, the iPhone SE, it's, it's cute as a.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:04.680]   Bugs knee.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:05.960]   It's just the cutest little thing.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:06.560]   I love it.
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.160]   And you know what?
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:08.880]   You know what?
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.960]   In this day and age, we're all wearing masks.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:12.960]   It's got touch ID.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.960]   You don't need Face ID.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.560]   You unlock it with your finger.
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.360]   I can't up my iPhone 11.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.760]   I don't know who you are.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.760]   You're some guy in a mask.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.360]   Nope.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.160]   The SE.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.160]   I'm telling you this is the way to go.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:27.760]   Mint mobile, we love Mint Mobile.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:28.480]   You're going to love them too.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.160]   Cut your wireless bill.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:35.160]   I think I cut mine by a third or two thirds rather to get your new iPhone
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.160]   SE with Mint Mobile service each for about $15 a month.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.360]   Go to mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:47.760]   It's this is the best way to get the iPhone SE Mint Mobile.com/twit.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.240]   You'll be cutting your wireless bill to $15 a month with their three month
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.060]   introductory plan.
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:53.160]   It's such a great deal.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.560]   Mint Mobile.com/twit.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:58.400]   Take advantage of this great deal and get yourself the cutest
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:40:58.960]   smartphone.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:40:59.840]   Everybody agrees.
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.720]   Devinda, you like this SE, don't you?
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.480]   I bet you do.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.560]   I mean, I like the SE.
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.560]   I wish I would love it to go bezel-less eventually.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.160]   It's funny to see it cheap in a forehead on a phone these days.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:19.360]   But, gosh, I mean, I really think honestly the touch ID now and days is really a great thing.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.160]   It's good.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:20.560]   It's good.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.160]   I've never liked Face ID and this is exactly why.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.160]   And the size is right.
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.760]   It's easy to carry.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:27.960]   It's fast.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.960]   It's got the iPhone 11 guts.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.160]   I do notice the screen.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.360]   It's funny how I've really become spoiled by the OLED screens and the iPhone 11 now
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.360]   because this L-series screen does.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:41.760]   It looks like an old iPhone as it looks like.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:42.560]   I remember that.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.160]   OLED is just so much better in like broad daylight and things like that.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:46.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:47.560]   It's a shame.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:52.840]   I will say I'm sad to see the iPhone 5 like case go away because to me that was
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.640]   really last like really nice super thin.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.840]   That thing just felt really nice.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:02.640]   So the last SE had that there are rumors that maybe we will see some of that design
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:03.840]   back with the next one.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.640]   So I'd be interested in that.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:10.440]   That was the old SE and the new one they went to the iPhone 8 design.
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:11.840]   It's a little bigger too.
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:15.240]   I think there are people who I think 4.7 is perfect.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.840]   The four inches a little felt a little tiny, don't you?
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.640]   A little small.
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:23.040]   We had a fun week this week on Twitch.
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:23.840]   I don't know.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.640]   Are we going to is our cooking thing in here because that was so much fun.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.440]   Let's watch.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:30.440]   Oh, previously on Twitch.
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:34.640]   Stupidest product Apple has ever made or I hope ever will make.
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.840]   I would actually nominate it as the stupidest tech product ever made.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:41.840]   The $12,000 solid gold.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:42.840]   There you go.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:43.640]   There you go.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.840]   Apple hasn't lost touch with the consumer with that product.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:48.440]   Ask the tech guy.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.440]   Some devices like my Dyson 360i aren't compatible with 5G bands.
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:56.440]   The vacuum cleaner and the router just can't see each other.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:00.440]   5G does not travel as far as 2.4 gigahertz.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:04.840]   You take your Dyson for a little walk and you walk far enough that you can't
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.640]   all longer see the 5 gigahertz, but you can still see the 2.4.
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.040]   Hands on Android.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.160]   A hidden Easter egg in Android opens up a setting section filled to the brim with
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.040]   settings that are made for developers.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:20.440]   I'm going to show how some of those options may be useful for everyone.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:21.840]   Hands on iOS.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:26.640]   I am going to show you how to create a emoji and then how to edit it, how to
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:28.040]   send it, how to record it.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.640]   Everything you need to know about memory.
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.440]   All about Android.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.240]   So I brought the Oppo Find X2 Pro.
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:40.040]   This is vegan leather and it feels super nice to touch.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:42.440]   This is it next to the V60.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.040]   I forgot the phones enormous.
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.040]   Are you have a small head?
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:45.640]   Help me, Obi.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.640]   You're my only twin.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.240]   I have spoken.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:50.840]   You should watch.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:54.840]   We did have a good week, but what is not in there is our Friday night.
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:59.640]   We started doing a Friday night fun thing with the hosts and this Friday night.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.440]   It was a cooking competition.
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:08.040]   Aunt Pruitt, Michael Sargent and Jason Howell received mystery ingredients in a bag.
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:12.840]   Our producer, Anthony Nielsen went shopping and brought them over and they
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:19.840]   were in one hour after opening the bag and this was all on live camera to make a dish.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:25.640]   Now you tell me if this was fair inside the bag snails.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.840]   Oh, man.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.840]   Oh, really?
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:32.040]   Pickled cactus, no palitos.
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.440]   Sounds like it could be good.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.240]   And dragon fruit.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.440]   Oh.
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.240]   The world's most interesting taco.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.440]   Oh.
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:40.240]   Oh.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.040]   That's what I'm thinking.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:41.840]   Oh.
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.440]   Anyway, it's a lot of fun to watch.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.240]   I think Aunt Pruitt took it away.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.440]   He won pretty handily, but it was a really a fun thing to watch.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:55.240]   Three Twit hosts go play the audio on this because Jim Cutler, our voiceover guy is so good.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:00.040]   It's Twit after our shelter in kitchen edition.
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:09.040]   A battle royale with Jason Howell, Micah Sargent and and Pruitt.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:18.240]   With celebrity judges, Mary Tofoli and Andy Anako, you won't taste the food, but you can vote.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.040]   All right.
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:21.640]   So now that it was.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.740]   Does that look like fun?
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:23.440]   We had a great time.
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.040]   Oh, my God.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.240]   This is amazing.
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:25.840]   This is great.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.440]   This is so much better than the Quippy Show.
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:39.140]   It's a good example of if you if you lean into what's going on in the world, you can make stuff that's timely and appropriate as opposed to mystery murder.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:50.040]   How's flip or or something like that or eating food off the floor or eating food off a floor after a cannon shoots it at you in protective where that should be given to a hospital.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:57.640]   Though having Mary Joe Foli judge my food sounds absolutely terrifying because Mary Joe Foli knows every single thing ever in the history of mankind.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:01.340]   I feel like she would just I know I learned something watching this.
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:03.140]   She went to the culinary Academy.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:12.540]   So she knows what she's talking about. She was actually pretty nice and thank you Jim Cutler who does pro bono voice over work for us.
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:15.740]   He is one of the best known voice over artists in the world.
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:17.740]   He used to do tech TVs.
[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:18.140]   V.O.
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:20.340]   He still does ESPN all the radio stations.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.940]   You recognize the voice.
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.440]   He does such a great job.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.340]   Thank you, Jim.
[01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:26.040]   I cannot thank you enough for.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:27.940]   I think it's pro bono.
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:32.740]   I haven't got the bill yet for the video video where he does for us.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:33.740]   It's pretty it's pretty.
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:34.840]   Have you checked your Venmo?
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.940]   Oh my God.
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:36.640]   I know.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:37.340]   I know.
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:41.740]   Do you send sure your Venmo payments in public or in private?
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:44.340]   Oh, no, I do private.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:44.940]   It's weird.
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:47.140]   My no reason for them to be public.
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:48.940]   Come on public by default.
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:50.340]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:50.940]   My son.
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:51.940]   Mine are private.
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:52.540]   I'm pretty.
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:53.040]   Check.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.240]   You have to turn it on.
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:47:00.640]   It's not like I've done anything inappropriate, but except when I go massage, like when I used to get massage is all the time, that'd be weird.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:01.440]   We like massage.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.240]   She is getting a massage once a week.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:08.640]   Well, what you do now is you use the right emoji and you can make it something anything you want.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.340]   My son and his buddies.
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:11.240]   He's 25.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:14.440]   They do it in public, but they it's it's for them.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.440]   It's an art form.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.440]   No, they'll do that age.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.640]   They love everything.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:20.240]   Yeah, but it's a joke.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:21.540]   It's never the real thing.
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:23.640]   Yeah, they say it's something else.
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.140]   And it's like it's ridiculous.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:26.440]   Yeah, it's pretty funny.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:30.540]   I think if I had any creativity, if I any sparkle,
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:31.940]   creativity, I'd be doing that.
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:34.340]   But I don't pay anybody for anything anymore.
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:38.140]   So how do you?
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:45.840]   Yeah, no massages, no petties, no manis, no haircuts as obviously none of that stuff.
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:47.940]   Yeah, I used to use Venmo for a lot of that.
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:49.540]   You should just keep the hair growing.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:51.240]   I want to see how long we can go here.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.640]   Well, I might have a choice.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.140]   Yeah, it's keeping going.
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:58.340]   Like for me, it just gets like bigger and busier and curlier, but you can just keep going.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:58.740]   I think it's.
[01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:02.340]   I used to be like you when I was a young man like you, it would grow out.
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:05.240]   So I never had hippie hair long hair.
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:06.440]   I want to have it.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:06.940]   I want to see.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:08.740]   Then I'm going to do ponytail guy.
[01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:11.340]   Nothing better than a gray haired ponytail guy, right?
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:13.340]   No, everything's better than a gray haired ponytail.
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:15.140]   They're your best legs.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:17.940]   Now, she's a bicycle.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:18.940]   You're a police don't.
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:23.340]   Then we'll do the ponytail because then you're definitely a Linux user, Leo.
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:26.640]   Like that is every person I used to work with in the server house.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.640]   Like, yeah, yeah, that guy.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:33.740]   If you guys watch Silicon Valley, there's like one recurring character who works in like the warehouse server farm.
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:34.940]   Definitely love him.
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:38.040]   I love him so much because I worked with that guy for sure.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:38.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:38.940]   Many times.
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:39.840]   Oh, that was real.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:40.740]   That was real.
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:43.040]   That was genuine.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:54.640]   So in the next couple of days, your iPhone and your Android device, if they're up to date, relatively up to date, we'll get pushed the new Apple Google API for contact tracing.
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:06.840]   And at some point, I wouldn't be surprised if the CDC or somebody doesn't say, okay, time to download the app because your phone is going to narc on you.
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:13.740]   If you get COVID-19, your phone will tell everybody you've been in contact with over the last few days.
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:21.840]   They won't say your name to say up somebody you've been in contact with has COVID-19 go home and stay home for two weeks.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:22.540]   Wow.
[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:26.640]   Will you let's ask to vendor because I'm sure he's thought a little bit about this.
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.840]   Will you do that?
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:31.140]   We completely completely.
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.940]   It is it is like the one thing.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:40.840]   Yeah, we've had crises as a country for for a while and it's asked so much of us all we need to do is stay home.
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.840]   It's a lot easier than going to you.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:43.440]   Ajima.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:43.940]   Yeah.
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:44.340]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:45.840]   Just stay home.
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:50.040]   We don't have to go work in the rubber factories to produce stuff for the war effort.
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:50.740]   Just stay home.
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:55.840]   Like I'm going to enable this and we're going to talk about this effort to between Apple and Google.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.440]   This is astounding.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:00.340]   Like this to me is the best of the technology industry.
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:07.840]   We criticize these companies all the time for privacy issues, but I love how this is a privacy focused effort from the start.
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.240]   This isn't a government database.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:10.740]   This isn't a centralized database.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.640]   All this information is anonymous.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.340]   It's not being shared with Apple or Google.
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:20.040]   I believe you guys linked to Chrissy Farr's piece at CNBC about how this all came together.
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:21.540]   It's astounding.
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:22.440]   Like this is great.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:25.640]   This is how we use tech to save the world, basically.
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.740]   This was a great piece.
[01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:30.840]   It was a code name bubble at Apple.
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:34.840]   Not sure what that what that means.
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:37.240]   At least it's not bubbles because that would have been weird.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:43.540]   In mid March, a small team at Apple started brainstorming how they could help.
[01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:49.940]   They knew that smartphones would be key to the global coronavirus response, particularly
[01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:55.840]   as countries started relaxing their shelter in place orders to prepare for that contact tracing within a few weeks.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.340]   That's how fast they did this.
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:00.940]   The Apple project code name bubble had dozens of employees working on it.
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:10.240]   Craig Federighi, a senior vice president of software engineering and Jeff Williams is a COO at Apple, both supporting this effort by the end of the month.
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:16.940]   Google had joined in putting aside any remember Apple was suing Google for like 20 years.
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:17.740]   It seems like.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:20.140]   Nope, putting aside any animosity.
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:26.040]   Tim Cook and Senator Pichai met on zoom to give their final approval while they probably use zoom.
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:31.040]   What did they did to you zoom because it's neutral, right?
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:32.640]   It was just a long email chain.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:33.740]   No, we got to do a face time.
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:34.840]   No, we got to do hangouts.
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:35.840]   Yeah, they do.
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.340]   I'm back and forth and back and forth.
[01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:40.040]   Pretty I think pretty impressive.
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:42.840]   Now a lot of people are very concerned about privacy.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:46.640]   Steve Gibson, our security guy went through all the white papers.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:49.040]   He seems very comfortable with it.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:56.740]   And if you look at what other governments have proposed absent the use of this API, it's pretty horrific.
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:01.840]   Australia, France, absolute grab for data.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.640]   Every database is bad.
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:04.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:06.640]   Alex, will you do it?
[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:16.440]   I will out of a sense of civic duty and my privacy concerns have been elayed by watching the federal government try to get its act together in the last couple of months.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:23.440]   And so instead of being concerned that they're going to suck all this data down and use it nefariously, I don't think they're going to be able to do too much with it.
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:26.140]   Just given that they can't really give it to Jared.
[01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:27.940]   He will do something with.
[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:30.740]   Actually, I wish it would be legitimate.
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:34.940]   It would be legitimate to worry about a data breach, but they are not going to get any data that could be.
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:38.540]   The companies aren't touching the data. It's all happening on device, which is great.
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:39.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.940]   So now that you know that sure, would you do it?
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:46.140]   I mean, I think I would do it out of civic duty and responsibility as well.
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:49.140]   I don't get a lot out of rebelling against it.
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:52.740]   I think there will be a lot of people that try to make a point by doing that because of privacy.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:58.940]   I just think at this point, it's like there's more that you get to work on with yourself than to like just focus on that.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:04.940]   So the Singapore government, which is an authoritarian government released a similar app probably without privacy protection.
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:08.340]   Only 25% of the populace used it.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:12.040]   Also, the worst, worst kind of design for that.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:14.240]   Wasn't that the one where they had to have the phones open?
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:16.840]   And the app running like there was no background.
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:17.740]   Children battery.
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:18.740]   Yeah.
[01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:19.740]   Not the way to do it.
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:23.340]   Do you think at this point you could be found anywhere at any time anyway?
[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:28.240]   Like if you don't have a phone, well, somebody made a point that Apple and Google have created an API for something.
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:30.240]   Add trackers have been using for years.
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:30.940]   Exactly.
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:34.140]   Anyway, but at least there's this private.
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:40.440]   Yeah, the Singapore thing is called trace together uses the Bluetooth.
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:42.040]   Yeah, trace together.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:43.540]   Let's make it all very hot.
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:44.340]   Let's make it together.
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:46.640]   And it uses Bluetooth.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.740]   If there's a strong signal, people are close.
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:57.940]   And then if the person is identified with coronavirus, Singapore's Ministry of Health has the app data.
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:02.140]   They can look it up and they can notify people, but it had to be running in the foreground.
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:05.340]   And of course, Apple doesn't let you run stuff in the foreground all the time.
[01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:10.740]   It also meant the phone had to stay unlocked and it killed the battery.
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:13.140]   So a lot of complaints on that.
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:14.440]   This will be a lot better.
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:20.040]   Apple and Google both said we will deliver our own app down the road way down the road.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:24.140]   We're really creating this API for public health officials to create an app.
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.740]   Have you heard of anybody?
[01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:26.940]   Is there a California app?
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:27.940]   Is there a US app?
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:28.440]   No.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:29.640]   I haven't heard about anything.
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:30.140]   Mm.
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:31.940]   I think that's the only way to.
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:32.840]   It could work.
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:39.340]   I think that if these companies want access to where we are at all times and we all want that to keep ourselves safer,
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:41.540]   I think we need to live in true transparency.
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:52.940]   So if we finally get comfortable citizens with full transparency, then all these companies should be transparent in terms of how they're building these things and give it to give access to it to everyone.
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:54.640]   So people can break it down.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:55.940]   And if well, that's what Apple is.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:57.040]   That's not open to it.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:02.440]   But like not hacking to it to like take advantage, but to be able to see what they're doing in real time with it.
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:10.640]   I think Apple has the white papers Apple and Google have delivered a very deep in a very detailed way described what they're doing and why they feel like it's privacy protective.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.540]   But you're right, it's not open source.
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:18.440]   But I think we have to at some point trust certainly at least Apple to do the right thing with this.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:19.840]   I it would be such a.
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:26.940]   They're the one company that's been like, yeah, preaching and actually doing the whole privacy focus thing compared to other companies.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.040]   So yeah, I'm down with it.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:35.140]   And you look at the process of this thing like there's a key that changes on your device like it's it's even if somebody hacked your phone.
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:39.940]   It seems like it would be really difficult to track like other people who you've been contact with.
[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:40.940]   You won't know who it is.
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:41.640]   You'll just know.
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:43.740]   Oh, you you touch a person.
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:45.040]   You were within range.
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:45.540]   Right.
[01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:46.540]   And that's all you need to know.
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:47.340]   You don't need to know the name.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:48.740]   You just need to know that you now now.
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:49.140]   Okay.
[01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:50.440]   For 14 days.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:51.640]   So yeah.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:57.940]   And you cannot send out that alert unless there's a there's a security that says, you know, there can't be spoofed.
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:55:59.140]   You have to get a test.
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:00.240]   It has to be positive.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.640]   And then the medical authorities will give you a QR code or some there's some way mechanism.
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:04.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:07.340]   So that you can't say I got it if you didn't.
[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:15.140]   I will say like this whole thing is like the one step forward that has made me feel a little better about our state the state of the world.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:20.340]   And certainly the state of the US right now because in a couple of months I plan to move from New York to Georgia.
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:24.840]   That was my plan for like the past year and Georgia is having its own issues right now.
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.640]   New York is the hotspot moving a baby and two cats and my wife and all of our stuff.
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:31.040]   It's yeah.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:32.240]   We you can do it.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:37.740]   It's going to be very difficult and having something like this to just be like, okay, maybe we were near somebody or something.
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:39.640]   We will try to fly down.
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.540]   Hopefully that's safer in a month or two.
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:43.640]   So there's a lot to worry about.
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:46.440]   This is like a step forward because a vaccine is far off.
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.240]   Other solutions are far off.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.240]   This is something.
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:49.840]   Right.
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:55.040]   I'm actually going to quest tomorrow to get an antibody test.
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:55.440]   They are.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:55.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:57.040]   I made an appointment for that.
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:57.540]   Did you?
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:00.640]   What are you going to do with the information?
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:01.240]   Because I don't know.
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:04.640]   I mean, that's the thing I caught up was like after I did it, I was like, why did I do that again?
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:05.740]   It's not proven.
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:09.240]   It's not proven that you can't change the behavior or anything.
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:09.740]   I know.
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:12.640]   But it's perception.
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:19.440]   It's like it gives us the feeling like we know more or we have some sort of control over the scenario.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:25.240]   Lisa, it all comes because Lisa, my wife was deathly ill all through the month of January.
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:27.340]   We think she got it in.
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:29.240]   We were in Reno in New Year's Eve.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:31.440]   Probably a lot of travelers there as well.
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:33.140]   She went came home with sick.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:33.740]   She went.
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:37.240]   I feel bad now in hindsight, she went to CES.
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:38.740]   Oh, gosh.
[01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:39.440]   Yeah, I know.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.240]   She stayed in a room when she wasn't feeling well, but she she did some stuff at CES.
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:45.040]   She went around.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.640]   We all we came home.
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:54.340]   She was still sick, went through a couple of courses in antibiotics, had many of the symptoms of COVID-19 and recovered, but it took four weeks.
[01:57:54.340 --> 01:57:55.340]   Wow.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:58.940]   I did not get sick, even though, you know, we share a bed.
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:57:59.540]   We share a home.
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:03.340]   My cook, we cook, you know, I didn't kiss her a lot, but I kissed her a little.
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:05.940]   I'm glad she's better, Leo.
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:10.040]   And now I'm surprised, like given the time of the same, but CES wasn't a huge hotspot.
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:10.940]   Well, this is one thing.
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:11.640]   It's interesting.
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:15.040]   We now know that some people with COVID did go to CES.
[01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:21.040]   And so there is some concern that maybe it was more of a vector than we knew at the time.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:23.940]   We're just used to getting sick after CES.
[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:24.840]   So everyone was like, whatever.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:25.340]   That's true.
[01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:27.440]   People thought it was a CES sickness.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:29.640]   But that just shows you how dangerous it is.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:31.540]   If anybody sick, it's a yes.
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:32.340]   We all get it.
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:34.240]   Right.
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:34.740]   There's that.
[01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:38.740]   And also, I'm always extra vigilant at CES to like, I don't touch anybody.
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:40.140]   I'm always using hand sanitizer.
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:43.040]   Like that's an area where I'm just very careful.
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:47.240]   I watch my hands a lot anyway, because I'm the one with the CES crud.
[01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:51.040]   And I did not get sick at CES, even though a lot of my colleagues did.
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.040]   Anyway, we're going to.
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:57.240]   So Lisa's going to get the anybody has because she's curious and I'm curious since I live with her and I didn't get sick.
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:58.140]   Did I get it?
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:58.740]   Not no.
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:09.940]   And then my son who came back from Asia at the end of March and quarantine himself did get sick in the 10th day or the 7th day of the quarantine.
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:11.740]   So I think he probably did have it.
[01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:12.740]   So he's going to get the test too.
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:16.240]   So, but again, yeah, if you test like, yeah, you had it, then what do you do?
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:16.640]   Is it?
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:17.440]   Yeah, it doesn't.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.640]   Because it's not proven that you can't get it again.
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:22.940]   Like that's more than if you know how sick you were.
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:25.240]   You're like, Oh, maybe it's not as scary.
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:26.040]   Right.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:29.640]   Like if you get it again, then you're like, Oh, I know how my body reacted last time.
[01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:30.740]   Maybe I'm immune.
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:32.240]   Maybe I got it and it didn't.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:35.340]   Maybe I was one of those silent spreaders.
[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:36.340]   I don't know.
[01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:38.240]   Nobody here has it.
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:41.440]   We close the studio to a studio audience.
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:42.440]   When did we do that, John?
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:43.940]   And a February, I think.
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:54.040]   And then as soon as the shelter in place for California happened, March 17th, we stopped having people come into the studio, except for me and as a skeleton crew.
[01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:55.340]   I don't know.
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:56.740]   I'm hoping we'll see.
[01:59:56.740 --> 02:00:01.040]   I hope you're all taking care of yourself, everybody, and you're you stay well.
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:02.740]   Yeah.
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:03.240]   Yeah.
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:05.840]   So yeah, I think I would put this app on my phone.
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:10.840]   I even if it were a privacy violation, I think it's our duty.
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:16.040]   But I feel like since it's Apple and Google, I'm going to feel pretty confident about that.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:16.740]   It is a good story.
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:19.340]   Read the CNBC story about how it came together.
[02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:20.040]   It's pretty cool.
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:26.440]   Apparently, Apple is also according to CNBC, trying to make your phone easier to unlock if you're wearing a mask.
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:27.840]   I saw this.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:32.240]   This was in beta three of iOS 13 and five.
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:36.440]   Instead of waiting for the phone to go, I don't know who the hell you are.
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:38.640]   You can swipe up and get that and get the codes.
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:43.440]   But it really was it really does now highlight what a poor choice face ID was.
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:46.340]   Touch ID is so good.
[02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:47.840]   I have two iPhones.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:48.240]   Yeah.
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:52.740]   iPhone seven personal and a work iPhone one has touched one of his face and touch is just so much better.
[02:00:52.740 --> 02:00:55.140]   It's not perfect, but my gosh, is it lovely?
[02:00:55.140 --> 02:00:56.240]   Yeah, what I'm wearing.
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:56.840]   Yeah.
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:59.440]   Let's see.
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.840]   Did you try the new Pixel Buds, Devindra?
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:02.640]   Do you like them?
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:06.540]   I did not Billy Steele it and gadget reviewed them and he really likes them.
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:08.140]   So that's like a step forward for them.
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:09.140]   They were my favorite.
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:13.240]   The originals were my choice for Bluetooth earbuds.
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:13.840]   They were as good.
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.840]   Really expensive ones and they were chump.
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:16.840]   They were a hundred bucks.
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:18.740]   Yeah, I thought they were very good.
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:19.540]   They fit well.
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:20.740]   The base was good.
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:21.940]   The audio quality was good.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:24.440]   I really liked the the Google Buds.
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:27.140]   I mean, the Samsung Buds, but they didn't have.
[02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:28.340]   Samsung Buds are different.
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:30.340]   Yeah, the last pixel.
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:31.840]   Oh, no, no, no, you're right.
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:33.240]   I was talking about the Samsung Buds.
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:33.740]   Yes.
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:35.040]   I love the Samsung Buds.
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:36.640]   The Google Buds were awful.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:37.240]   Yep.
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:39.340]   Those are the ones with the string behind.
[02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:41.640]   They look like a little croquet holding your glasses on.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:42.540]   Which I don't mind.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:47.140]   I don't mind the string and that's one thing I kind of miss now that we're going to true wireless earbuds.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:52.740]   Like the Beats X were my favorite for a while because that's something to hold it around your neck.
[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:56.740]   You know, if you have an earbud and you have to take it off when we were going to stores,
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:59.040]   the best thing you could do is shove in your pocket.
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:01.040]   Hope you have the case, but that's an easy way to forget it.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:06.240]   Throw your pants in the wash and you know, or if you share it laundry, no laundry.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:11.940]   I'm just teasing you.
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:14.940]   By the way, I've had air pods.
[02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:18.440]   I've had so many, so many that I've lost and then.
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:19.840]   Yeah, I've stolen.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:24.040]   I've almost given because I feel like I've spent the over $1000 on them.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:25.840]   This is so these companies.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:29.540]   It's a great way for companies to earn more revenue, but as somebody who cares about like,
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:32.440]   yeah, the longevity of consumer electronics, it's sucks.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.340]   It's not great.
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:37.140]   Morning, yeah, because of the battery dies, there's no fix really or do they.
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:38.640]   You drop them on the sidewalk.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:39.840]   Yeah, there's a lot.
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:45.340]   Just to preview next week Xbox Series X gameplay will be.
[02:02:45.340 --> 02:02:46.340]   I guess there's no.
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:48.640]   Are you excited, Alex?
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:50.440]   Are you you're getting down, man?
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:53.840]   I'm excited because I'm going to be indoors a lot.
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:03:01.040]   And so I've actually been upgrading my gaming setups and I would love an excuse to convince my wife to love me by another console.
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.040]   And so if it's awesome, I'm going to be like,
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:04.840]   honey, I have to play the thing.
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.240]   It's a great time for all the people.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:07.540]   Honey, it's part of my job.
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:09.040]   I want to play single stock.
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:09.440]   I help.
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:10.340]   I played too.
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:11.740]   I want to play it, honey.
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:14.440]   She would know it's not part of my job, but she did.
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:18.640]   Let me buy a gaming set racing sim set up for my house.
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:22.340]   So now I can do like F1 racing on my PC and it's so much fun.
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:23.240]   I'm having a blast.
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:24.640]   We're thinking maybe we should stream this.
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:25.540]   Should we stream this?
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:26.740]   You think I think we should.
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:29.340]   May 7th, 11 a.m. Eastern time.
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:31.040]   That means 8 a.m. for me.
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:31.840]   Nothing like it.
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:33.040]   It'll look like a gaming PC.
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:34.540]   Yeah, that's going to be our surprise.
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:35.040]   Yeah.
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:35.640]   Yeah.
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.040]   Yeah.
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:38.640]   Oh, well, I don't know.
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:41.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we could wrap this up.
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:44.640]   I'm sure everybody's a little hungry.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:48.340]   I have had so much fun hanging out with you guys.
[02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:49.140]   Sure.
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:50.540]   It's so great to see you.
[02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:52.640]   I just I'm so proud of what you're doing.
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:56.440]   I think peace inside is an amazing thing.
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:58.140]   Everybody should check it out.
[02:03:58.140 --> 02:03:59.840]   It's just what we need in this time.
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:00.940]   I appreciate it.
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:04.940]   We have so many ideas and it's cool to work on something that's so connected to things that I love.
[02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:05.240]   Yes.
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:11.840]   Like in my daily life, which is it's rare because we all start doing our work, you know, and we do the things where you think we're supposed to be doing.
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:14.440]   Like you knew me from tech stuff from pop culture stuff.
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:14.940]   Right.
[02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:23.140]   And it's cool to see now I'm using the things I've learned in those worlds now bring it to a space that I love and I use these tools daily myself.
[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:25.240]   So yeah, it feels very aligned.
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:26.740]   You always were pretty enlightened.
[02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:28.440]   I think that it's.
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:30.540]   I don't know if I would say that, but thank you.
[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:31.640]   No, you know what?
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:38.140]   It's funny, but part of your enlightenment is not saying I am a perfect being part of your enlightenment saying I'm a real human.
[02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:46.240]   And that is enlightened to me and you're very warm and enveloping and loving and I think this is a this is your time.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:48.140]   So I'm really glad you're doing what you're doing.
[02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:50.540]   I hope you're enjoying your quarantine.
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:51.740]   Keep up the good work.
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:53.040]   No, I appreciate you.
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:54.140]   Thank you for having me.
[02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:55.040]   It's great to see you.
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:59.640]   Alex, I don't know what to say except I miss rubbing your head.

[02:05:04.340 --> 02:05:05.240]   I miss you too.
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:07.840]   It's been I've never had more fun with you in studio.

[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:30.340]   What's it called?
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:32.240]   Oh, it's called equity.
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:42.040]   If you're into finance and startups, but I'll just say this Leo, like eventually the world's going to get a bit more normal and I will be back in S F and I'll be back in the studio and then you can rub my head again.
[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:44.940]   So I will to in time to bring it back.
[02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:47.840]   Do you all feel like gosh, I just can't wait to hug some people.
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:48.540]   Do you feel like that?
[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:48.840]   Yes.
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:50.440]   I'm just dying.
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:53.440]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm a hugger.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:53.740]   Trust me.
[02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:58.540]   I'm a hugger, but I just want I want to be able to go to people's like the dating.
[02:05:58.540 --> 02:05:59.040]   I'm single.
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:00.540]   So it's a bit of a different experience.
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:01.340]   How do you date?
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:02.140]   Do you date?
[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:07.140]   No, no, I mean, there was one person that I was kind of maybe seeing.
[02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:07.940]   That's boring.
[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:09.340]   You got to FaceTime each other.
[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:17.340]   I mean, what you think there's there's there's ways then to build the romance and the attraction in a different way than what you still, which I think is awesome.
[02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:24.840]   But I haven't gotten into the place where I'm like open to actually dating or meeting a lot of people because it feels like such a distraction like.
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:25.340]   Yeah.
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:27.040]   How many people can you text at once?
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:28.040]   I have other things to do.
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:30.740]   We're like FaceTime people are using Tinder a lot.
[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:34.240]   I think I think it is going through the roof, but I don't know.
[02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:37.340]   Hinge all of them.
[02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:38.240]   I mean, I'm on.
[02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:40.140]   I'm in what's hinge.
[02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:41.740]   It is another dating app.
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:43.840]   I'm on unhinged.
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:47.240]   So it's good, but maybe you and Elon Musk.
[02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:48.940]   Yeah, I'm hinge.
[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:50.140]   Unhinged.
[02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:51.140]   I'm on unhinged.
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:56.140]   Yeah, it must be weird if you're single to it isn't in time.
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:58.140]   Yeah, because then and then you're connecting.
[02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:03.240]   People for a moment like there will be one or two days you talk and then you're like, man, you like this isn't going anywhere.
[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:10.040]   Like I'm not going to you might people have asked me to social distance hang, which is like, so they'll be like, we'll walk.
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:12.740]   We'll take a walk, but I'm like, I don't know.
[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:16.940]   That's worse because you're so close and yet so far.
[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:22.540]   Oh, you're really cute, but stand over there.
[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:26.040]   Well, Alex, you got your got your honey with you.
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:30.840]   And I'm really glad to hear that in a nice dog and a big yard and your Xbox.
[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:32.040]   What more could anyone want?
[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:33.840]   I'm OK.
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:35.740]   I went to the grocery store today and stocked up for a week.
[02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:38.940]   I'll be literally in this chair until next Sunday when I go to that again.
[02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:41.440]   So maybe I'll send you over to visit my mom.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:45.840]   I'm sure she's getting a little lonely over there and crayons.
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:49.440]   And the vendor of Harder War, he's there with his wife, his baby.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:50.240]   But you know what?
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:52.240]   Yeah, this is a special time.
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:54.840]   You're going to look back on this and say, I got to be with her.
[02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:58.340]   At this special age, you'll never forget this.
[02:07:58.340 --> 02:07:59.940]   I'm telling you, take a lot of pictures.
[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:01.840]   Yeah, you'll be very grateful.
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:06.940]   Yeah, it's weird though that I'm seeing less of the baby because I'm doing more work at the home office.
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:08.440]   So it is strange.
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:13.240]   It is strange how that's all working out, but I'm trying to take advantage of the best we can from this time.
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:14.640]   Hey, at least you're working, right?
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:15.740]   I'm working.
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:16.640]   I'm not going to.
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:18.340]   Yeah, I'm going to be grateful for that.
[02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:21.940]   And also check out the Engadget podcast, which is another thing I'm working on.
[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:25.540]   We just chat with Rick Daniels, by the way, the creator of upload on Amazon
[02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:26.040]   and that guy.
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:27.140]   Oh, I want to watch that.
[02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:27.940]   Is that good?
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:28.940]   It's so good.
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:30.640]   I think you would find it a blast.
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.940]   It looks really cool.
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:38.540]   And that's it's I'm trying to, you know, what I'm trying to do is ration because I know we're going to get six months from now.
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:41.040]   There's nothing because nothing's being produced.
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:41.940]   What does it take a year?
[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:42.840]   Maybe a year from now?
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:43.440]   Nothing.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:44.640]   There are some big binges.
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:48.040]   There are some big shows that nobody has seen that I want to recommend to everybody.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.040]   So when you're ready, Leo, tell me now, don't leave us.
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:51.740]   A good wife.
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:52.840]   Good wife.
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:53.640]   That's good.
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:54.640]   The good one.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.940]   The good one is the good wife.
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:56.840]   The good wife is fantastic.
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:57.240]   Yeah.
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:08:59.340]   And the successor to the good wife.
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:08:59.640]   Yep.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:00.540]   The good fight.
[02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:01.340]   The good fight.
[02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:02.440]   I love her.
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.540]   But the good wife, yeah, they had a lot of stuff.
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:05.240]   They had Bitcoin.
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:07.040]   They had a lot of technology stuff in the good wife.
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:08.140]   I thought that was a very good show.
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:08.240]   Yeah.
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:12.140]   And good fight has like Jonathan Colton songs breaking down all sorts of fun stuff.
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:18.140]   Like it's so geeky and nobody realizes it because it's on CBS and they think it's a stodgy, you know, show for parents or something.
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:21.140]   You know, what else nobody realizes Westworld's finales tonight.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:21.840]   Yeah.
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:22.540]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:23.440]   Oh,
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:24.040]   I like the lot.
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:26.240]   She's in two season two is bad.
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:30.940]   This season is fun because they kind of just give you figure out what's going on.
[02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:32.140]   I know.
[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:34.140]   I'm watching it.
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:37.140]   I feel like an old man who said what's he going there?
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:37.940]   What?
[02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:39.940]   Who why did he kill her?
[02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:40.440]   I don't.
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:41.440]   It's so pretty.
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.240]   It's so pretty.
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:43.940]   And the sci-fi world is so wild.
[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:45.140]   Like that's I love that stuff.
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:47.540]   And they saw that Singapore too, like the future city.
[02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:51.440]   I know Singapore and a place that we were last year.
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:57.140]   Valencia, Spain, the beautiful architectural creations.
[02:09:57.140 --> 02:10:05.340]   That's the that's the headquarters of the Westworld company is in Valencia, Spain.
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:06.540]   So they mixed that with Singapore.
[02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:07.540]   It's very interesting.
[02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:09.540]   Did you do that dinner, Leo at CES?
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:10.940]   Because insight is the company.
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:12.240]   They had like a promo dinner.
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:12.540]   Insight.
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:13.040]   That's it.
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:13.340]   Yeah.
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:13.740]   Yeah.
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:14.540]   It was wild.
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.440]   Like that that.
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.740]   That's just me to this season.
[02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:18.440]   No, it's probably why I didn't get sick.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:21.640]   What else anything else to vendor?
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.340]   You want to share anything else we should watch?
[02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:24.240]   I mean, that's it.
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:25.540]   Check out the Engage podcast.
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:27.240]   I reviewed upload on gadget to you.

[02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:30.940]   If you haven't watched that, that's on Hulu.
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:33.740]   Yeah, but I'm trying to be really careful.
[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:35.640]   I don't want to squander.
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:37.940]   Yeah, there's too much.
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:38.940]   So there's too much good stuff.
[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:39.840]   So I think you're fine.
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.540]   Just yeah, go with your heart.
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:42.340]   Maybe it's great.
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:43.340]   Maybe we won't run out.
[02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:43.840]   Sure.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:45.740]   You don't seem like the type that watches anything.
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:51.540]   You just you know what I have been when I'm in a relationship with someone I am these days.
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:57.040]   I haven't been because I've been working on piece inside live my co-founders in Thailand.
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:57.640]   Wow.
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:00.940]   So she's she's the middle of the night.
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:02.640]   Yeah, she's the other side of the world.
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:03.340]   It's daytime.
[02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:05.640]   So that's when I get to catch up with her and work through stuff.
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:10.540]   So I haven't been watching as much as I typically do, which is really strange.
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:13.040]   Like I'm not gone through one series like,
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:17.640]   I did check out it does tell you though how much of that is all about romance.
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:18.640]   It's Netflix and chill.
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:20.740]   It's like a thing to cuddle and watch.
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:25.940]   And then you can yell at your partner when they get ahead of you and you were supposed to watch that.
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:28.840]   I watch the goonies and I watched the Matrix.
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:30.140]   I'm doing throwback.
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:30.640]   Yeah.
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:32.640]   Yeah, I've been doing some throwback stuff.
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:36.840]   But for me, it's it's like WC fields in the bank dick.
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:39.640]   So it's a different kind of throwback.
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:41.340]   Hey, everybody.
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:42.240]   You guys are great.
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:43.340]   It was really a pleasure.
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:49.340]   Thank you for being here on a twit on this in the middle and the middle of May.
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:50.040]   It's May.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:53.140]   It's May outdoor fooling around begins today.
[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:53.840]   Oh boy.
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:54.840]   Tomorrow.
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.240]   Yeah, nobody right.
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:59.140]   Nobody's doing that yesterday was naked gardening day.
[02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:02.540]   I didn't see one naked gardener because I was.
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:03.240]   I was.
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:03.540]   I didn't.
[02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:04.540]   Oh, you missed it.
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:06.540]   You didn't talk about the killer hornets.
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:08.640]   Can we do you want to talk about the killer hornets?
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:09.940]   There's not really much tech there.
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:10.740]   It's weird.
[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:11.940]   It's weird.
[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:12.940]   It's terrifying.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:15.140]   They're up in Washington state.
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:20.640]   They their sting is so long because they're two inches long and powerful.
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:26.140]   It goes right through a bee suit and they said it feels like molten metal being injected in your skin.
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:27.740]   And they came.
[02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:28.940]   I guess they came from Asia.
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.340]   We're not sure how they got here.
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:31.940]   But here's the worst part.
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:34.140]   This is definitely a sci-fi movie.
[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:45.620]   They have giant pinchers and the way they make their living is they go around to be colonies and chop everybody's head off and bring the body back to the colony for
[02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:46.220]   feeding.
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:48.520]   There's some great video of this online.
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:49.720]   It's horrible.
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:50.220]   Yeah.
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:54.520]   This is the end of the world because don't we need bees to survive like these are a huge part of our ecosystem.
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:54.820]   Yes.
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:59.120]   And so is this the beginning of the end like or the plagues are starting to be this is one of the.
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:01.620]   Another cap on our milestone towards the end.
[02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:04.120]   If it starts raining frogs, shera, repent.
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:05.420]   That's all I'm saying.
[02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:08.220]   There are locusts plagues currently in parts of the world.
[02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:11.420]   So for tracking plagues, we are kind of on step three of this.
[02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:14.420]   I'll just say I moved out of the Pacific Northwest a while ago.
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:17.020]   Right call as it turns out because that's where they are.
[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:18.020]   And all that's where they are.
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:19.020]   That's where they are.
[02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:25.620]   And because you spent a childhood watching Davey and Goliath, you know that we're going through revelation right now.
[02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:28.520]   And this is the seven seals are about to be broken.
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:29.120]   And it's all over.
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:30.420]   What's really, really funny.
[02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:38.220]   I didn't bring this up earlier during the contact tracing app discussion, but I bet you there's certain subgroups of Christianity who think this is like the mark of the beast.
[02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:43.820]   And there's a lot of cross over between tech solutions monitoring and Pentecostal Christianity.
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:45.220]   So there's going to be some of that coming up.
[02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:46.120]   You'll see it on Twitter.
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:47.020]   It's going to be a mess.
[02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:47.320]   Boy.
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:48.620]   Yeah.
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:49.920]   Oh, Lord, you know what?
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:51.020]   Sorry for bringing that.
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:55.320]   We're going to get the same people here next week and we'll do another nice conversation.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:58.820]   Try to stay sane during this crazy time.
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:13:59.820]   That was not a dry cough.
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:01.920]   I thank you all for being here.
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:03.220]   We really appreciate it.
[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:08.520]   We need you for to continue doing these shows because it'd be silly for us to sit around just talking to nobody.
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:10.020]   So thank you for watching.
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:12.520]   We do tweet every Sunday afternoon to 30 Pacific.

[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:23.320]   After the fact, I know that's a terrible.
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:26.820]   I should do some water.
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:30.320]   No, no, no, you know, at the end of the day, my throat, I've been talking all day.
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:35.620]   I have water, but I prefer to chug a lugsome sanitizer.
[02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:36.220]   Where's that?
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:37.320]   Oh, well.
[02:14:38.620 --> 02:14:41.820]   What was I saying? Oh, yes, you can get on a man shows at twit.tv.

[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:30.620]   [Music]
[02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:49.040]   (silence)
