[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.560]   And this week is-- we should call it--
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.800]   foo-twit, twit-foo, something like that.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.760]   We're all in studio.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.720]   And all of our guests today have driven back from Sebastian
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.840]   Pool, where the O'Reilly media folks just threw their--
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.680]   I think it's what, 9th annual, 8th annual food camp.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.200]   11.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.680]   11?
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.960]   Who will 11?
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.480]   Wow.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.040]   Fused to answer friends of O'Reilly.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.400]   Tim O'Reilly, I think you know we've
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.360]   had him on many times.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.960]   He's a brilliant thinker, publisher.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.880]   You've seen the O'Reilly books.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.320]   They're the ones with the animals on the cover.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.320]   Actually, they're more than that.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.680]   But that's the best known ones, including the Pearl book,
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.080]   programming Pearl, programming Python, learning Pearl,
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.240]   learning Python, all the classics.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.280]   So it's so nice to have Gina Trapani here with--
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.840]   Trapani, I'm sorry, with this here.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840]   Great to be here.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.440]   Great to be here.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.880]   It's my first time in the cottage after doing twig
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.240]   with you for over a year.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.080]   More than a year.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.440]   And it's smaller than I thought it would look like--
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.200]   Yes, it's time.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.120]   --is that an insult.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.080]   It is kind of teensy.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.600]   But this is an amazing setup.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.640]   I'm so thrilled to be here.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.440]   It's cozy.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.040]   We're so glad of it.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.080]   It is really cozy.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.200]   And we're building a new place because we really
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.960]   have outgrown this.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.760]   So it's kind of--
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.260]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.880]   --this is kind of-- in any ways, I
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.360]   think this is kind of fun to do, though,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.200]   as a kind of almost a last farewell.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.560]   You know, certainly by next book, can't we better be in the studio?
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.920]   But I'm thinking even sooner, maybe like next month,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.880]   we'll be in the new studio.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.920]   So thank you for being here.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.480]   It's great to see you.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   Yeah, thrilled to check out the original cottage.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.840]   You, of course, Gina is a founder of Life Hacker
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.360]   and is at smarterware.org.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.320]   And as the author of ThinkUp at ThinkUpBack.com, which
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.720]   is a great Twitter analyzer that was used by the White House.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.800]   And a regular on this week in Google every Wednesday
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.920]   on the Twitter network.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.600]   Look who's here.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.800]   I can't has been.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.840]   He did it for the loves.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.680]   Ben Ha from--
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.280]   Oh, yeah, the shirt.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.000]   Cheeseburger.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.840]   I can has cheeseburger and fail blog.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.120]   And you just acquired Andrew Barron's--
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.120]   yeah, I did it for the loves.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.680]   There you go.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.360]   That's actually dangerous to wear these days,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.800]   because of Lolsec.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.440]   You realize that.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.560]   Yeah, Mike, get arrested on the way back.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.120]   They might think that you hacked Sony or something.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.720]   Yeah, I actually hacked the shirt.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.080]   Actually, for all we know you did hack.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.800]   You looked-- did you hack Sony?
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.680]   You know, based on what our experiences have been last night,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.240]   whatever I tell you, I couldn't trust me anyway.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.120]   Are you a werewolf?
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.760]   I am.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.320]   He is so a werewolf.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.680]   We'll talk about werewolf for the second.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680]   But it's great to have you been.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.720]   His newest acquisition is Know Your Meme.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.880]   Andrew Barron's a great site for finding out
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.800]   what the hot meme is right now.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.360]   It's video, right?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.600]   And there's a video component.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.240]   But actually, we were really excited about the site,
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.560]   because of its history and its research
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.440]   into memes and internet culture.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.800]   Well, and you are a meme, because of course, I can't
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.360]   has cheeseburgers.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   Probably the longest running, a paulingly horrible--
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.640]   internet meme.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.920]   I'm not a cheeseburger guy.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.560]   I know.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.060]   I know.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.360]   You're more than a like cats.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.720]   I'm a fail-blog guy.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.480]   I like to see sadness and dismay and horror, not happy cats.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   I get it.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.980]   That's cool.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.560]   I know many people like you.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.080]   Ben is great.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.920]   I know you're kind.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.400]   Ben is great.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.680]   He and Marshall Kirkpatrick of Read/Write Web and others
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.920]   are looking at reinventing news.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.640]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.600]   And so we'll talk about that.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.440]   That's really exciting.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.640]   Nothing to do with fail-blog.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.920]   Yeah, is that funny?
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.420]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.280]   At first, I thought, what is he up to?
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.360]   What are you up to?
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.480]   You're up to something.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.400]   You have to know good.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.720]   Anyway, it's great to see Ben.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.520]   Ben's been on before on our social hours show.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.520]   We've talked to you, but it's great to have you.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.000]   And it's kind of funny, because returning from Foucant,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.800]   like he did last year, Dan Shapiro's with us,
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.880]   now last year, you were doing something
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.440]   you couldn't tell anybody about, which you called, I think,
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.480]   at the time, the kayak of consumer electronics.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.680]   And that was actually more than I'd said to anyone
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.520]   at any time about that.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.680]   So your listeners get the first--
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.440]   You opened the kimono.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.160]   Since then, that company was started and sold to Google.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.920]   Yes, or no?
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.400]   Two weeks ago.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.880]   Two weeks ago.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.400]   Congratulations.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.040]   That's what I call turnaround.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.000]   Less than a year.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.040]   Love it, efficiency.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.800]   So officially, now you're at Google.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.240]   I am.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.720]   But we won't ask you about Google,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.120]   because Google doesn't know you're here.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.400]   Because I still have no idea what I'm doing.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.480]   Lean into the mic when we talk.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.160]   But it's good to have you back, Dan.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.560]   And Dan is a really great serial entrepreneur
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.680]   and has a number of other very interesting investments,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.000]   which we should talk about, because there's
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.120]   some really interesting stuff.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.520]   That's one of the things at Food Camp that happens is people
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.640]   go around and say, what did you learn?
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.200]   What did you see any interesting new startups or ideas?
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.320]   Joining us a little later, Kevin Marks will be here.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.800]   He'll wander in.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.000]   And I think let Ben go in a little bit,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.360]   because a lot of folks have to fly out.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   But it's just so nice to get some of the brains over here.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.720]   Gina, this is your eighth Food Camp.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.440]   I don't know if it's eight, but maybe eight.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   Maybe fifth.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.040]   This is your main.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.760]   It's my main if I've been to Food and I've been to Food East.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.120]   Any day that I get the Food invitation is a lovely day.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.040]   There have been years that I haven't been invited.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's hard talking about food, you know, because--
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.080]   You feel a little elitist.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.580]   It is.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.640]   You know, when I saw some chatter on Twitter about it being
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.440]   sort of the nerd elite, and it's just
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.000]   feeling of exclusion, at least I felt very excluded
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.760]   when I wasn't invited.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.240]   But it's not elitist in the sense of Ted is, for instance.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.200]   No, it has a different feel.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.760]   For one thing, it's not a conference,
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.840]   and you can't pay to get in.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   I guess then in some ways--
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.720]   Right, there's no money involved.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.040]   There's no money exchange.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.240]   You are invited or not.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.280]   You're invited or not, and you can sleep on the floor.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.920]   And it's not done to invite yourself to beg, to plead,
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.160]   to say, can I come back?
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.880]   It is done, not successfully.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.280]   It's right.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.400]   It's not right, exactly.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.000]   So what is it?
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.360]   Well, it's an unconference, meaning that the sessions
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.120]   aren't planned.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.800]   I think it's the original unconference.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.640]   I believe it is.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.960]   And it kind of spawned the bar camp movement as well.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.240]   Because people weren't invited to Food, said, oh, well,
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   we're going to do our own thing, which is bar.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.320]   Although Tim has said that he loves the idea of bar camp.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.720]   He doesn't mind.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.760]   He doesn't mind.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.760]   Tim like.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.920]   It is very Tim like.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.440]   It's the thing about Tim.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.520]   Not only is he a great thinker and leader in our community,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.440]   he's a tribe leader.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.080]   He recognizes the geeks.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.120]   He has lots of great connections.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.160]   And the point of food is to get people together.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.720]   He thinks who should talk in a place to talk.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.000]   So an unconference means that you
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.120]   aren't a speaker and a attendee.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.680]   There are no divisions like that.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.160]   Everybody is invited to speak kind of at Hawk
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.040]   in a very informal way.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.560]   And then really even the sessions are not kind of hierarchical.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.680]   They're really egalitarian.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.040]   That's what I love about it.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.960]   You don't have a speaker in the front of the room,
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.680]   like, wah, wah, wah, wah, with attendees kind of dozing off
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.520]   or on their laptops.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.880]   I mean, at this food, and I don't know
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.400]   if you guys felt the same way, there
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.600]   are very few people on their devices during discussions.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.720]   People were fully focused and arguing.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.840]   There's a lot of arguing.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.760]   In fact, Ben was giving me--
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.480]   In perfect association reception in Sebastopol.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.320]   Yeah, well, I probably did have to do that.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.640]   Last year, everybody had--
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.480]   or not everybody-- there were a number of people at iPads,
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.960]   but very few people had anyone trying to solve this.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.560]   Very few this year.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.840]   And they discouraged that.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.200]   They don't want people to be--
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.240]   They don't want people to pay attention.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.440]   Yeah, they pretty--
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.080]   they outwardly encouraged us to be present.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.040]   On the other hand, the people who were there--
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.160]   and Tim said this time there was about 35% new people.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.720]   So about a third of the people were there.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.200]   The people who were there are kind of a big deal in many cases.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   Marissa Meyer was there.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.600]   I showed she showed up last night.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.760]   Apparently, you missed it when Larry Page flew his helicopter
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.480]   into the--
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.960]   Oh, if you look at Google Maps and you
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.160]   zoom in to the O'Reilly offices from the satellite view,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.320]   you'll notice that there's a large patch of really high
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.800]   definition, like underground tents.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.960]   And you're like, why is that there?
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.040]   And everything else is blurry.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.400]   And that's because they shot it from their helicopter
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.760]   from one air.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.320]   They did a fly over one year.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.080]   When they were doing the Google Maps photography,
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.640]   I think I was asleep under a desk when that happened as well.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.720]   But I was on site.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.400]   It's stayed up to late playing "War Wolf."
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.400]   And also--
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.480]   It's a reoccurring theme.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   It is a reoccurring theme.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.640]   As you and I were talking, this is the only time
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.960]   really you get to play where you'd never get to play any other time.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.240]   Do you plan your office?
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:23.920]   Actually, we do.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.080]   At Game Nights at our company with Mike.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.840]   This explains a lot.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.560]   He's really good at it.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.760]   I play everywhere I go.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.920]   I did it at South by Southwest.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.320]   We hijacked a couple of conference rooms in the middle of the night
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.360]   for one aim to 6 AM.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.040]   And it turned out to be a pretty big event.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.640]   Ben pretty much made a total fool of me during "War Wolf."
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.440]   I mean, not only was it lessons in extravertism,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.920]   it was also lessons in taking out
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.720]   Gina or engineering away to take
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.560]   out Gina in the first and second round.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.440]   It was kind of amazing.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.640]   It wasn't me all the time.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.280]   Well, you were in cuz with Harper basically.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.680]   Well, Harper's just crazy anyway.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.440]   He is just crazy.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.280]   That's a perfect example.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.520]   Harper is the in charge of digital strategy
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.960]   for the Obama campaign or in the Obama-Resin Obama.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.280]   He's the
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.040]   country that was also there.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.320]   CTO of the United States.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.520]   The US CTO.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.160]   OCIO.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.280]   So, just sit there and be playing "War Wolf"
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.320]   with the CTO of the United States of America.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.000]   It's pretty bizarre.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.880]   And by the way, you and he are like trying to kill each other.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.800]   And I mean, it's-
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.880]   I don't know who he was.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.400]   So-
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.480]   He's pretty crazy.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.080]   So, half the time, I don't even know who I'm killing.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.280]   And that's the fun of it.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.080]   And later I find out.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.680]   I was like, oh, well, you know,
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.800]   that was the funny thing at South by.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.760]   It was like, we're playing "War Wolf"
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.840]   and a bunch of entrepreneurs,
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.000]   they're getting more and more into it.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.160]   And they're literally screaming at the venture capitalists
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.880]   who are their trying to look at money from
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.800]   and calling them idiots and morons.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.680]   And, you know, you see the whole dynamic play out
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.960]   and you're like, well, that's the bed you made.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.680]   So, here's the image of a food camp from Google Maps.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.960]   And if you zoom in, you can see that this is what happens
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.520]   is that this is the O'Reilly media headquarters.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.520]   This is their offices.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.240]   And they-
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.920]   People camp.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   I camped this year.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.240]   Gina, you-
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.680]   Are you going to point out your tent, Ben?
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.680]   I see you-
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.000]   No, but look at how high depth that is.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.840]   And the rest of it you go right here.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.680]   And they didn't really close fly by.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   Where are we?
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.680]   Somebody laying down.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.520]   You can't tell.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.080]   If you go to the right, over there, I could go in.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.080]   That's a little soccer field where there are robots.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.520]   Yeah, they're selling that Google or some food or something.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.000]   That was a robot soccer game in the upper left-hand corner.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.840]   And what are these people doing?
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.640]   Yeah, they knew that, yeah, those are robots right there.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.920]   And I feel like if you go down,
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.440]   I thought somebody made like a Google AdSense.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   That's hysterical.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.720]   Apparently, there's one guy off in a tent over on the side here just by himself.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.320]   There's always that guy.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.440]   One of the things that's interesting about going to a conference like this was just really
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.960]   fairly social is that most of us are, except both-
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.720]   With the exception of Ben.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.320]   The exception of Ben are pretty introverted.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   And so it's-
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   I don't understand your accusation here.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   I second.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.320]   Introvert.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.320]   And the results.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   Extravert.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   Extravert.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.320]   Actually, that's the thing.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.320]   That would be-
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.320]   We should play introvert, extrovert.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.320]   That would be kind of fun.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   You're awfully quiet.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   I think you're an extrovert.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.440]   All right, we're making in jokes.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440]   That's a bad sign.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.320]   Anyway, Friends of O'Reilly is what FU stands for.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.160]   And it is- I think it's a great thing that O'Reilly does because it is a rare chance for
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:27.560]   people like Vivek Kundra to let their hair down, to hang out with entrepreneurs, people
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:35.520]   who are doing creative stuff in the nonprofit space, and really exchange ideas in a free
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.520]   fashion.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.960]   There's a FU bar also.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.960]   This must be mentioned.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.360]   B-A-R as in drinks.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.360]   As in drinks.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   But it's labeled the FU bar.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.640]   I was drinking- Barrettunde and I were drinking as absinthe last night.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.240]   Absinthe to make the heart grow fonder.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.160]   And, and, and, and, and, um, discussing-
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.600]   This is what Barrettunde's session was on.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.960]   Was on, uh, Utopia versus Dystopi.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.640]   Is the world about to end or is technology going to save us all?
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.840]   And it was a- it's just great.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.560]   We're standing there holding absinthe and drinking and discussing this.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.360]   And it was just- it's like going to college again.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.160]   Leo, it's entirely possible you had that imagine- you do imagine the whole thing.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   That was after the absinthe.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160]   Actually, Barrettunde wasn't there at all, would you?
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160]   I don't even know who that guy is.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.760]   So Leo was standing next to a tree talking to us about an hour.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.760]   See that tent?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   Off in the corner?
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   That's me.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   And I enjoyed myself.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.160]   The best sessions was, uh, it had Tim O'Reilly.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.040]   You had, um, Nick Bilton from The New York Times.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.480]   And you had Vivek, uh, who, uh, Kundra, who's our CIO, uh, talking about privacy.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   Incredible.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.800]   Tim was- Tim was talking about how, you know, he lives in public and thinks it's underrated.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.640]   You had- And I'm on that- I'm in that, obviously, that group.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.120]   You had Nick talking about Good Heavens.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.120]   The companies are- Right.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.360]   Himping out our privacy information to everybody what's being done about this.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.960]   And you had Vivek furiously taking notes and asking really smart questions.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.960]   And you know where that's going.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   Absolutely.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   Tim said, I thought that- I kind of like what Tim said, which is essentially that, uh,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.520]   yes, we have problems with privacy.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.000]   In fact, and it's the very nature of technology that, uh, all this- you should just assume
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.280]   all this information is going to leak out or get out or somehow be figured out.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.360]   So the real issue is not to legislate again, you know, in, in draconian fashion to kind
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.360]   of protect us, but to do what we've always done with privacy, which is to set standards
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.480]   and mores and taboos about privacy.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   He said, we have windows.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.480]   We all have windows.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.600]   Uh, but it's so taboo to come up to somebody's window and look in that we don't do it.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.960]   It's actually against the law, but even the taboo, uh, you know, everybody has locks,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.720]   but a lock is more- In fact, this is another great session I took on lock-
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   Locks.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.720]   Lock cracking.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.680]   Even lock- Ocks aren't- are just a symbol of, please don't come in here because they're
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.480]   easily circumvented.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.160]   And- and, uh, so Tim said we don't want a chilling effect from legislation saying companies,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.880]   for instance, uh, I think, uh, Nick suggested there should be a standard security model
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.120]   so that things like the PlayStation Network don't hack, don't happen, that every company
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.800]   that holds consumer data should buy- by law required to use this standard security model.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.040]   And Tim said, well, then you've anointed a winner.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.720]   There's not going to be any innovation in that space, you have a very chilling effect by
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   doing this.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.520]   Yes, maybe people are a little more secure, but probably not.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.280]   And what you really should do is you should establish, you should figure out where is the
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.680]   harm in privacy violation?
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   What is the harm?
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.520]   Not every privacy violation is harmful.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.240]   Don't assume they're all harm.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.280]   So let's- let's take that, uh, case and talk about the girl who made her party, birthday
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.080]   party public by accident in Germany with 1500 people showing up on Facebook.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.080]   She invited people.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.080]   That's right.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.080]   Well, she made it open.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.520]   1500 people are a few people, or 15,000 people, some crazy number.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.840]   The harm on that.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.440]   Like how do you quantify the harm in that?
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   I would say the harm is de minimis that she had to move her party.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.440]   Right.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   She had the higher security.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.440]   The police show up.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.280]   No, she didn't have- no, well, that's dumb.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.440]   She shouldn't have had the party at the same place.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.440]   She should have moved it.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.920]   Well, people showed up anyway, right?
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.920]   It's their house.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.600]   Oh, she gave out her house.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.440]   Okay, that was kind of dumb.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.440]   But, but, but it should, how, I mean, that's a foolish thing to do.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   Right.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.960]   And are you saying it was too easy?
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:27.000]   I'm saying development of software needs to reflect the societal norms of what privacy
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.360]   is in order for what you're suggesting to work.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.360]   Right.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   How about Andrew Wiener?
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.600]   Let's talk about Andrew Wiener.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   Hot to me.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.680]   No, but I'm just saying that was a dumb thing to do with some harm for him.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.280]   And if you are an Andrew Wiener fan for you-
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.200]   It's a good name Wiener just is too good for this.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   But that was his mistake.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.920]   I'm just like it was her mistake.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   It was his mistake.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.440]   So what are we going to legislate?
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   No, the interesting thing here is when, when you have products that, for example, disclose
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   a whole bunch of information to people or hide information poorly.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.280]   And then this is one of the examples we were talking about in the session, you have something
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.480]   like the Burmese Hunta or the Chinese government-
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.480]   Well, that's legitimate.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.480]   Mining, all this available information.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.640]   But in another way, which is yes, we have windows, no, you shouldn't look in them.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.080]   But imagine if the entire government of Burma or China can look in your window, take notes
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.920]   on everything you do and you'll never know they were there.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.480]   And that's where it starts to get a little fuzzy because yes, you make silly mistakes.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.320]   Your life leaks a little bit and you can say that's up to you.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.600]   But the problems here are life-threatening in some cases, real and the-
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   And there are enemies.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.120]   There are bad people out there who want your personal data.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.280]   That actually was Nick's point was that we're all good people in this room.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.040]   So we're assuming everybody's good, but there are bad actors who will use this data in a
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   bad way.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.960]   Well, you could see why this is a challenge.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.360]   I mean, I'm on Tim's side, but you've raised some issues.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.680]   Yeah, it's an interesting discussion.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.440]   The problem is that privacy used to be a gradient, meaning that if somebody came to your house
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.600]   and actually took a photo of what's happening inside, there was no place where they actually
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.240]   posted and make it public that would go basically binary all over the world.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.680]   Now privacy is binary.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.040]   Either you have it or you don't.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   Right?
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.200]   If you're supposed to photo that's out in public, you can never take it back.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   Right?
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.480]   And that's the problem with privacy is that we've come to this extremist world.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.960]   While we were sitting in one of the sessions actually talking about all this, this news
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.840]   crossed the wire and probably somebody should have mentioned it and brought it up because
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.400]   it's an interesting story.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:29.680]   The United States is underwriting a detour around sensors.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   Oh, that's right.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:36.560]   The Obama administration has agreed to help deploy shadow internet and mobile phone systems
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.680]   for dissidents in repressive areas.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.640]   So that I mean, I kind of applaud this at the same time.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.600]   It's kind of an interesting idea that the effort includes secretive projects to create
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.160]   independent cell phone networks inside foreign countries.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.680]   I guess this is, you know what?
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.800]   This is better than military intervention.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.920]   This is maybe even better than having a spy network.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.920]   The resistance.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.920]   So that what we didn't have to stand back when and is not what we've done in all sorts
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.920]   of really upsetting military situations.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.640]   Is it worth the same way for communications or is it different?
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.200]   I don't have to pay over a minute to myself.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.560]   No, no, you are paying over a minute forever.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.560]   Okay.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560]   Sorry.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.560]   What fun is this, right?
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   You know, the funny thing is it was $2 million.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.040]   It was a $2 million State Department grant.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.040]   I mean, it's not even that expensive.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.480]   But an interesting policy decision.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.680]   Would you say based on the fact that Harper was there and Vivek Kundra was there that
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:38.200]   we have a government that is technically more savvy and I think you have politicians
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.600]   who are coming from the technology age?
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.240]   I think I would say, brock, finally.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.240]   Yeah, finally.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.520]   Barack Obama being able to use the internet during the campaign was a massive, massive
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.320]   advancement in government understanding technology.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.440]   But from what I can hear about the political structure and how campaigns work, there's
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.480]   still very, very much in the dark ages as to how the internet works.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.720]   Well, Cuf 2.0 is one of Tim O'Reilly's big interests.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.120]   And there was a big presence in Code for America.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.880]   I think there's a big focus on civic hacking.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.360]   What is Code for America?
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.480]   Code for America is a nonprofit organization that make the of fellows basically who get
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.960]   paid very little to do some civic hacking, which means to build tools, software tools
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:23.160]   that companies have but to give those to government, open data and tools that help citizens help
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.160]   themselves.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.640]   They call it a new kind of public service.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.560]   And this is what Tim has talked about.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.560]   We've actually did a special on government 2.0.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.720]   You can go back to our Twitch specials feed and read all about it with Tim.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.320]   But one of the things that Tim was talking about is the idea of a government as, and
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:47.240]   this is very 21st century, a platform as just as Facebook would be a platform or Windows
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.600]   would be a platform, a platform for people to write software that makes government work
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   better.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.600]   Exactly.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.200]   So to do that, you need APIs into the data.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.440]   Open data, APIs and hackers who are willing to spend time to build tools that make things
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.840]   easier for citizens to help themselves and help one another.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.240]   So this is really the Code for America is one part of the tripod, the hackers, but you
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.320]   also need to get APIs and open data.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.120]   One of the neat things I think about the way this is being done is back in the age, this
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.400]   would have been a $100 million contract to some large consultancy.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   But there's really cool companies.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.200]   There's a company called Sercradup in Seattle, for example, startups, small companies that
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:27.320]   are getting small pieces of access to this data and then using that to grow and make
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.640]   more information available to the greater public.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.960]   And that's something that I think that partnership with Entrepreneurism is also an exciting feature
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960]   that we've been in now.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   Definitely.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.520]   And what was interesting is that through you get to recognize patterns.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.280]   You get to recognize what's actually happening in the technology world, what people are thinking
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   about.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.560]   And as you see, all the Code for America fellows were there and people, somebody came up to
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:52.200]   me and I forgot who it was and said, "Well, it's like Code for America is the new Facebook."
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.960]   And there was this kind of pop-up like this.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.960]   That was pretty amazing.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.720]   Although everyone not in from the US, there were quite a few international attendees.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   I mean, my roommate was from New Zealand.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.960]   She pulled me aside and said, "What's all this for America stuff?"
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.360]   She thought we were really like, "Ultra National."
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   Yes, she did.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.400]   It was actually a meme, but it was a joke meme.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   That's right.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.560]   It was pretty funny because all the Brits were saying, "Hi, I am from whatever, for America."
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.080]   I sly mocking.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.440]   So Colin, who was one of our newest employees, he came from Philadelphia, he put it out this
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440]   site.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.840]   This is OpenDataFilly.org.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.240]   And the data on the Philadelphia region is plentiful.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.800]   Search and find that data with OpenDataFilly.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.320]   It gives you a chance to scrape and get information.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.360]   There's an API, a scraper wiki API, SQL, light database.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.360]   That's kind of cool.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.160]   That's kind of neat.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:50.160]   One of the big things I saw, you're right, Ben, you start to see threads come through
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.160]   all of the sessions.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.320]   You can see that this is what these people anyway, and I think if these people are representative
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.920]   of the people who are really doing some interesting thinking globally, and I think Tim does really
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.080]   make an effort to do that, that these threads are important because these are not just here,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.400]   but what everybody's thinking.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.800]   One of them is big data.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   Yeah, huge meme.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.120]   And what we can do with big data.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.120]   What is big data, Gina?
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.600]   A huge, large aggregate sets of data that can give us insights into behaviors and make
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.280]   life better through those insights.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.440]   I guess, I don't know.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.680]   Yeah, it used to be basically called data mining because if you had a huge set of data,
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.120]   you would go look for a nuggets of information that's actually useful.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.520]   What's happened is in the last 10 years, the amount of data is exploded where data mining
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.880]   no longer is actually the right way to look at it.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.720]   You don't mind for little things out of it.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.720]   You look at the large aggregate data set and see what comes out of it that can power your
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.720]   entire business.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   Right.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.360]   The only thing that's happened is it used to be the only way that you had big data was
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.920]   a large company would go and have the data on its customers and its functions, but there
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.840]   was no access to small companies, to individuals, to government data.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:56.360]   Now we're actually entering an age where anybody can go access massive data sets across
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.120]   different disciplines, bring them together and build something new out of that.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.680]   And finally, the walls are coming down around some of those data stories.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.600]   Yeah, and I think that's the interesting part is that the walls are absolutely coming
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   down.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.760]   So it used to be that you were siloed in your data set that you could actually only mind
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.960]   the data that you had and to get other people's data to work nicely with you was really hard.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.600]   But now data works really nicely almost across every single social and internet company in
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   the globe.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.800]   There was a huge emphasis on just measuring everything.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.840]   I mean, geeks are just enamored with data.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.840]   Measuring and visualizing.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   Measuring and visualizing.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.360]   So I mean, fitness was actually another geek fitness was another big theme.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.140]   And a lot of that was just like getting the metrics, the devices that measure your heart
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.040]   rate and your steps, the steps taken and your sleeve like the Fitbit and the.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:43.040]   I was talking to one of the guys that talked to Jason there who is runkeeper.com.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.760]   Yeah, he was an interesting guy.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.280]   They announced an API.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.920]   They call it the health graph for, you know, they've been keeping people's run data for
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.920]   some time.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.200]   Then they want to keep all your health data in an open database with an open API, have
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.760]   all these devices right to it because when you know what your heart rate is and what
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.080]   you're running was and your stress level was and maybe your cholesterol level and how
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.280]   much you slept and you can you can collate all that data.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.600]   You can see very even learning a lot about your.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:15.760]   So that's happening is that you know, API is a method of accessing data and the reason
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.200]   we have API is that we're very limited pipe and connection in which we could access other
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.680]   people's data.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.320]   Imagine in a world where the pipes are cheaper, the data storage is cheaper.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.440]   You don't need an API anymore.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440]   Why not?
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.440]   How do you access it?
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   You just get dumped.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   It's just there.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.440]   Right.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.920]   So this was the issue with Twitter was that they would never let anybody have the firehose,
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.440]   which you of course would love, Gina, which is everything.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.120]   You have to buy it.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.920]   But so they gave you an API so you could ask for stuff.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.920]   Right.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.200]   You'd like to have the dump, the whole thing.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.800]   The reality using the Twitter API now is that you request a page of 200 tweets, you
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.760]   know, kind of one at a time on the on the poll API and it is really limiting, right?
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.160]   So you're talking about a time where we could, you know, query the entire Twitter database.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.880]   I mean, even Twitter, but it's just there.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.880]   You have it.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   You just have it.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   This is part of it.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   Exactly.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   Right.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.400]   And this was actually an issue for my previous short-lived company, Spark By, where we were
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.600]   trying to make it really easy to go and find the best consumer electronics item, answer
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:17.240]   questions like, what's a great red Dell laptop that's Photoshop compatible?
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.760]   And we wanted to go and we wanted to know everything that was on Amazon, but because
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.920]   they would only give us API access because they'd say, you can only talk to us once
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   a second.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   That's right.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.640]   You have to ask every time not the raw dump, we had to jump through a lot of hurdles in
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.960]   order to make that work.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:35.440]   So companies are coming to terms with the balance between you can have everything and
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.000]   know we're just going to drip feed you.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.840]   And I think that's an ongoing evolution.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.040]   So APIs at some point are going to be overtaken by something else that's going to allow us
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.800]   firehose and just consistent, always on persistent access to data from our partners.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   Benha is here.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.080]   He is the CEO, cheeseburger.com.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.400]   I can ask cheeseburger.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.280]   It's really weird when I say stuff like that.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.200]   And then you say my title of my company.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   It doesn't quite match.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   Your choice, man.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   This is what I love about Ben.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.800]   He can be the hugest goofball in the whole world, which I witnessed last night at three
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.040]   in the morning while he was, you know, killing me in werewolf.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.400]   And then you go to a session with the guy and he's all smart and stuff.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   Crazy.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.400]   He's a smart and serious.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   It's actually really cool.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   It's the glasses.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   It's really cool.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.400]   It's the glasses.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.840]   And actually that's one of the best parts about food camp.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.000]   You see the full person as opposed to just, you know, the.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.680]   Also Ben on beer is a, is it experience?
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.680]   A loud experience.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   I don't know.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.680]   Yes.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.680]   I think that's friendie aid.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   I hate to say.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   Sorry.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.400]   You see me at any conference in the world.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.000]   You'll know exactly what Jesus talking about.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Well, let's put it this way.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   We're playing werewolf.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.280]   We can't tell if Ben's a werewolf because he seems to be asleep.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.080]   He didn't wake up with the rest of the villagers.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.400]   His head was just on the table, but he woke up eventually and killed us all, which was
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.520]   kind of annoying, frankly, to be killed by a drunk werewolf is just even more humiliating.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.520]   Very dramatically.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520]   Standing on the table.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.520]   I.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.520]   I.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.160]   Give you anyway, as I was saying, Ben has your in fact, Ben wants to reinvent how we read
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   news.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.160]   We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   It's a neat project.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.600]   And he wants your help, which is, which is even neater.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.040]   I like that a lot.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:15.760]   Also Gina, Trippani, of course, from this week in Google and smarter where.org Dan Shapiro.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.760]   Should I say from Google?
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.760]   Should I say?
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.760]   What should I say?
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   From Google from Google.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   I love it.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.760]   Two weeks ago.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   What is your title?
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   Like Google?
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.760]   What are you doing?
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.760]   Product manager with some adjectives and decoration on top of it.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.760]   So working on.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.760]   And you acquired your company.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.760]   Yes.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.760]   Yes.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.760]   Yes.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.760]   As of two weeks ago.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   Working on figuring out what I'm doing.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.200]   And also, you know, a serial entrepreneur and an investor in a lot of interesting startups,
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.960]   which we will talk about too in just a little bit.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.160]   But before we do that, I'd just like to mention our good friends at Citrix who make a product
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.480]   that everyone who is in support ought to know about and ought to be using.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.800]   Of course, you know I'm talking about go to assist express.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.560]   We started using it on the screen savers back when it was just go to assist to.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.080]   It was kind of cool on TV.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.080]   Solve people's.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.720]   It was a neat segment we would do.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.680]   Most of the time would be a fun call and we'd talk you through it.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.760]   And every once in a while we could actually say, "Okay, we're going to fire up go to assist
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.760]   and get into your computer."
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.640]   Well, that was almost 10 years ago.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.240]   They've come a long way.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.240]   And it was good then.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.400]   And it is even better now.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.040]   Citrix, you know, because they do the great back end for remote access on Windows machines,
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.680]   both for enterprise and consumers.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.640]   It's just the best.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.000]   128-bit SSL, great 24/7 support for you.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.360]   If you are an IT or software consultant and you have clients and colleagues who need to
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.440]   be supported, this is the easiest way to do it.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.840]   Much better than phone support.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.480]   Certainly a lot better than traveling across the world, across the country.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.720]   You even just walking down the hall.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.240]   We always knew when the IT guy at Tech TV was coming because he wore a key chain with
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.240]   a lot of keys on it.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.680]   You hear him, "Jing, jing, jing, jing, coming down the hall."
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   It wasn't Santa.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.560]   Usually he was there to yell at you.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.720]   You could do it yourself.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.880]   What do you mean you put chocolate in the keyboard?
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.560]   I seem to have a big problem.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.280]   You could do this yourself.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.280]   Remote support.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   It's just the easiest way to do it.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.120]   And you could do up to eight sessions simultaneously.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.640]   Unattended sessions.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.480]   Just all the features that support pros looking for.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.560]   Drag and drop a file from your computer to the support ease computer, whether they're
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.280]   hot fixes or patches or installs.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.280]   It's just so easy.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.280]   You can even show them your computer.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.400]   They say, "This is what it's supposed to look like, dude."
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.360]   You could get an assay of what software is running, including all the security software,
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.440]   what operating system version I can go on and on.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440]   You know what?
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440]   Better than that, try it.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.440]   Free.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:34.640]   For 30 days, PC or Mac, visit gotoassist.com, g-o-t-o-assist.com/twit.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.640]   We love Citrix.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.440]   We thank him so much for their support of this week and tech and all of our Twit show.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.440]   Ben, what do you tell us?
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.560]   I know you're going to leave in about five or ten minutes.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.560]   What is Moby Dick?
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:50.160]   The Moby Dick project was an idea that came from actually a food camp and ORD camp where
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:55.000]   we talked about what's wrong with the way news articles are presented today.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.760]   The problem that we see is that one, the article format's been around since the 1800s.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.720]   Basically, we've been consuming the same news product for hundreds of years.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.520]   That has led to just being ported to the web the way people think about articles.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.400]   Imagine a breaking news story, let's say the Japan earthquake, and you read the same article
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.240]   over and over again when they update the first paragraph.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.240]   Halfway through the article, you're going, "Hey, haven't I read this before?"
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.120]   It's a real waste of your time.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.800]   Second, the collective social memory of front pages of newspapers, if you walk down the
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.120]   halls of the New York Times, you'll see these collection of amazing historical moments that
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.960]   you no longer see because the internet just wipes everything clean every time.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.960]   It's hard for you to get that.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.960]   It's possible, but it's very difficult for you.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   Easier than paper.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   You get the paper.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.400]   You have to go to a library or go to their arch.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   But at least it's available, and at least we remember it.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.680]   When we actually remember those moments, it's a part of who we are.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.240]   Imagine what do the newspaper look like when you were born in your hometown.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.560]   Those are really interesting memories that you will never get on the internet.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   It's a point.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.720]   You can't get it now, but if it's on the net, it doesn't.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.520]   It's a part to find the newspapers don't organize it themselves.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.000]   You actually don't know how news forms over time.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.080]   Third, I think there's not enough diversity of opinion in the way news is presented.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.000]   There's a handful of large media outlets, and they try to be un-biased.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.320]   What's happening is they have a bias you just don't know.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.520]   It's very hidden.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.520]   We should be transparent about it.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.240]   We should say what the bias is.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.120]   This is not a company that you want to start.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.360]   This isn't a service you want to provide.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.120]   It's a new way of thinking about journalism.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.720]   I'd like other journalists to consider.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.920]   I would love to actually have an open source software project that handles these features.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.400]   You've composed a WordPress style software like it.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.240]   We're big users of WordPress at Cheeseburger.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.120]   We love what they did with the open source platform and how they've built a community
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.120]   out of it.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.880]   We love for them or others to help us take the lead.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   You did a little mock-up.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.560]   This is what you showed at Foo Camp.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   It's a wireframe.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.480]   You want to give us a little tour.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.240]   First of all, it's got tags up at the top.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   That's right.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.160]   The tag is actually provided by the users.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.920]   This is like a Wikipedia almost.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.920]   A little bit.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.480]   It's edited by a handful of people who work on this page and about this topic.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.240]   There are selected editors for the page.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   You self-select.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   You want to create a page?
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   You can do it yourself.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.040]   How is this different from a Wikipedia topic?
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.600]   Wikipedia has great breaking news coverage, actually.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.560]   It does, but it doesn't help you scrub.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.280]   It also doesn't provide you with the details as it's going on.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:23.000]   Scrub in the sense that I can run through history and put back what it's called.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.720]   It does provide your revisions, but it's more technical.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.160]   Also, this is not about facts.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.640]   This is not about the actuality.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.740]   You can insert opinion.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.400]   You can insert perspective.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   You can insert basically.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.560]   There's a place in it for facts, but also a place in it for opinion.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.040]   So on the left, that's the facts.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:48.000]   So here you have a mock-up of a page with a headline that's probably from the pro-revolutionary
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   side.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.320]   You could potentially actually have a government-centric voice that says, "You know what?
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   Those are rebels.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.320]   They're just criminals."
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.320]   Interesting.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   Which you heard out of Egypt.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.640]   I know that it seems awkward and weird to actually encourage diversity of opinion when
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.160]   you believe the other side is false, but I want to trust the public to make that opinion
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.360]   for themselves, not to be filtered purely by journalists.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.480]   So on this page would you have on the other side of the page the pro-Egyptian government?
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.080]   Well actually, what's interesting about this page is that if you scroll to the right,
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:21.280]   so the left has the facts, the middle and has media, I'm using the entire 1080 space.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.120]   If you move to the right, there's unconfirmed stream of tips and news that's coming in,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.280]   where the crowd actually helps you sort and-
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.000]   So you have karma, you have plus and minus.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   That's right.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.400]   It's commentary on the far right.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.560]   And in the middle you'll see this bar that says "credible opinion speculation."
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.000]   So on top of that block you'll see that you can actually vote on something.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.320]   So you can say, "This is speculation.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320]   This is a piece of credit.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.320]   This is incredible.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   You can actually say why it's speculation."
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.320]   That's fantastic.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.920]   And so the theory is if enough people use this, the crowd source, I mean I believe in
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920]   the crowd.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   There are problems with the crowd.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.480]   You look at Dig for instance and the crowd can be "game," the crowd can be "wrong,"
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.440]   but you trust them to do something like this.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:05.680]   I would trust the crowd to be no more smarter than being able to pick our own leaders.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   Which is to say-
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.680]   Which is what they do.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.840]   Which is to say that we are able to run ourselves.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   And if that's the case, why not news?
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840]   Run our news.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   There's an important fact to it here.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   I think people should know, which is that in addition to being a world-renowned cat genealogy
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.400]   and morphology expert, Ben's actually a closet journalist.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.000]   Yeah, I have a degree from Adil.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   And knows what he's doing in this space.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Did you ever work on that?
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   I interned.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.720]   I interned for the Oregonian, the San Sentinel in Florida, and the Times Pick a You down in
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.720]   New Orleans.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.000]   And you decided you would want to be one because?
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.640]   Well, when I graduated in 1999 and dot coms were handing out signing bonuses like chocolate
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   candy tickets.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.640]   And you knew how to program.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   Actually, sort of.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.640]   I knew how to work with HML.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.640]   You knew how to fake it.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   I knew enough.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.640]   Which is much more important.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   Yes.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   It's a little all-er in life.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.480]   Fake it till you make it.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   Good.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.240]   So what can people do if they- I mean this is an interesting idea.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.720]   Is it right up on it on Read, Write Web, Marshall Kirkpatrick, who was at the food camp with
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.760]   us at this session, wrote an article about it?
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:11.400]   So we're looking for journalists as well as technologists and especially UI designers.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.400]   And we're thinking about putting together a working session.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.400]   Is it a UI problem you think?
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.720]   I think I want to think about this outside of the scope of journalism.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.960]   I want to think about information, not how journalists think.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   That's interesting.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.400]   And I want us to actually try to kind of get out of that.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.360]   Every time I've gone to a journalism conference, it's been very difficult for them to get
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.400]   out of the problem of, "Oh my God, journalism is no longer paying the bills.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   What do we do?"
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   Let's stop talking about that.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.400]   Let's talk about progress.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.680]   What do we have to do next to save journalism?
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.680]   Right.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.680]   Really?
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.680]   So email me, benhuh@gmail.com.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.680]   B-e-n-h-u-h@gmail.com.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.960]   Really 400 million pages a month on your site.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   500 now, I think.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   She's the least.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   Holy cow.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   Nice.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.960]   Holy cats.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.960]   Holy cats.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.960]   What are they?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.960]   It's not just cats though.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.960]   You have other animals, right?
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   Well, fail blog.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.960]   Human animal.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.360]   And meme base, which is all about memes.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.360]   Right.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.800]   And my personal favorite there, I fixed it.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:11.880]   Yes, which just the book came out of all the fix it projects that people never quite
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.880]   finished to the level of.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   It's quite got right.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.480]   Is this a variation on fail blog?
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.480]   It is.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.480]   It's a section of fail blog.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.920]   It's called Redneck Repairs.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.160]   There I fixed it.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   There I fixed it.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.480]   That fail blog got to work.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   And I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.

[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.

[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.

[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.

[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.

[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.480]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.480]   This guy is pretty amazing.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   Pretty cool.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.480]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:05.480]   A lot of famous CEOs will give college commencement addresses, that kind of thing.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:13.480]   Zuck spoke to eighth graders at the Bellhaven Community School in Menlo Park to commemorate
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   their attitude of "I can, I will, in order to come as far as he has."
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.480]   Listen to the kid's voices.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   This is a young man who not too long ago was in his middle school sitting on the seat just
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.480]   like yours.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:37.480]   It's a handful of dreams and not knowing where or where it was going to lead them to.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.480]   I love the little kid voices.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   It has led us, it has led him to our community.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   And very soon he will be our neighbor.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   This young man.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   By the way, that's what this is all about, that Facebook's moving to Menlo Park.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.480]   I know he's thinking, get on with it.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.480]   I just want to talk and get the hell out of here.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   Hurry up.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, lady.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.480]   It's sunny, I'm sweating.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   So without further ado, I like to...
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   I should have wear the flowers, flip-flops today, the shower flip-flops.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   And I think she said "Zuckerman."
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.480]   Did she say "Zuckerman"?
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.480]   I think she introduced him as "Zuckerman."
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.480]   You know him, you love him.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   CEO of Bookface.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   It's kind of cute.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   Thank you.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   Thank you, Principal of Aura, for having me today.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.480]   And congratulations to all the creators of Bellhaven for your promotion.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   I think that's kind of... I bet you, Mark, feels very comfortable with that group.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   It's like he said, "There are no shortcuts to success.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.480]   A lot of building a company or a product like Facebook is just about determination and believing you can.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.480]   Everything that's worth doing is actually pretty hard."
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.480]   That's kind of good.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.480]   That's kind of something you don't hear people say very often.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.480]   Relationships are the most important thing.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.480]   Focus on building great things with people that you love, know,
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.480]   or ever does anything along great friendships, make life fun and meaningful.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   I think that's true.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   And do what you love, which is probably the best message you can give in.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   And don't believe anything you saw in the movie.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.480]   And the movie was a lie.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.480]   Those sons of bitches, they lie!
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.480]   I'd love you to just lose it.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   No.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   If you love what you do, you'll power through adversity.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.480]   It's a lot easier to focus on challenges that you actually really enjoy doing.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   I think it's kind of cool.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.480]   Sweet.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:43.480]   And Alexa Sotsis writing for TechCrunch points out that there's no shortcuts is grammatically incorrect.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.480]   So don't do it.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.480]   As is Ackerman.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   As is Ackerman.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.480]   And bookface.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   I love it.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   Actually, this is kind of interesting.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   We were in Subastopol.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:05.480]   And the folks who do some of our, we're going to be doing our bandwidth at the Twit Cottage,
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   who will be charging us, I think actually fairly good rate.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:15.480]   I think somewhere around $1,000 for 35 megabits symmetric, which is kind of stunning since
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   that's what a T1 costs not so very long ago, are putting in gigabit fiber in Subastopol.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:27.480]   And they're going to charge for those speeds $70 a month.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.480]   Wow.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.480]   Do you want to move?
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:35.480]   To Tim's serve big data over those points directly from Riley Dens.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.480]   Wow.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   I don't know if that, does that scale?
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.480]   I don't know.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.480]   Dane Jasper we've had on before.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.480]   He's the CEO of SonicNet.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.480]   Says it's a trial.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.480]   It's going to reach about 700 homes.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:55.480]   But he says, I do believe that service that fast for a low cost is possible.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.480]   He's doable.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.480]   So, well done, Dane.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.480]   SonicNet's a really nice little company actually.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.480]   But they don't serve much to the people listening today.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   Every time I talk about bandwidth, there's always somebody in Sweden who says, you know,
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   if you have 100 megabits symmetric for $14.19.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   And they go, thank you, I know.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   But they're getting me back.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.480]   They also have to eat lootfisk.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   They have to eat lootfisk.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   Now that's the Norwegian.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.480]   I don't know.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.480]   And they don't get the US only.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   You googles.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.480]   That's really what it is.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   They don't get all that US only stuff.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   They don't get Netflix and I do.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   They didn't have Google Voice for years.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   Yeah, so that's really, they're getting me back.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.480]   We have Spotify.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   Do you have Spotify?
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.480]   No, I don't have Spotify.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.480]   iTunes Match.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:45.480]   Apple had a little bit of a press conference keynote this week that WWDC was on Mondays.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   And I don't believe that was this week.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.480]   Hi, Seth.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   So, Eileen, what's the news this week?
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   WWDC.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   Oh, that was this week.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   That was this week.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.480]   It feels so long ago.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   This week, we've been on another planet for three days.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   So, some more details coming about iCloud.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.480]   And in particular, iTunes Match.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.680]   iTunes Match is the service that allows you to, in iTunes, say, you know, I have this.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:16.480]   Can you make a copy available on my iCloud for $25 a year?
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.480]   So, interesting article on the infinite loot column, Chris Forresman writing in the...
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   Arge Technica website.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   He says, "I, iTunes Match will let you mirror up to get this."
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   What is Google?
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.480]   20,000?
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   It's 20,000 songs on Google Music.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.480]   I think it is.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   Yeah, that's...
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   25,000 for it.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480]   It's like they...
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   Yeah, we got you 20...
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   25,000.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   How about that, Google?
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   See you on.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   Raise your hand.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   It's just a coincidence, right?
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   25,000 tracks in your iCloud.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.480]   The songs can be pulled down, downloaded to any iPhone, iPod, Touch or iPad, as well as synced
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   with Macs or PCs running iTunes.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   This includes tracks that you have ripped from your CDs or downloaded from the Internet,
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   even those you've obtained in a less than legal manner.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.480]   So, actually, I think this was the...
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   I'm just channeling Steve Jobs, but I could see him going into the music executive's offices
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   saying, "Dudes, we figure out a way for you to make money on pirated music."
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.480]   20, you know, and I bet you Apple's given most of this money back to them, right?
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   You know.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   They're so they can do the service.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   Dude.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   Yeah, at that price, there's not much money there.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.480]   It's got to be going back to it.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.480]   Yeah, but I think the record company, if they get 25 bucks a year from all the pirates,
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   they're happy.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.480]   That was...
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.480]   They'd written that off the books anyway.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   Right.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.480]   That is more than zero dollars.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.480]   More than zero.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   I actually thought the most interesting thing just was the news that's knocked out after
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.480]   WWDC, which was about the subscription pricing.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   Did you hear about this?
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   They're going to do that?
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.280]   So there was this big thing about subscriptions had to...
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.480]   If you wanted to do a subscription, it was actually really something.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   Oh, the news...
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   I had subscriptions.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   Yes.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.600]   You had to pay 30% to Apple and you couldn't price it any higher than any other source.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   And this was the death now to a lot of publishers who just couldn't afford to take their thin
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.440]   margins and a lot 30% on.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.520]   We were screaming about it.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.480]   I mean, it was such a stupid thing for Apple to do.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   And they agreed.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   It seemed like such a grab.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   And they backed down.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.480]   Complete about face.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.000]   I got somebody tweeted me and said, "See Leo?
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.800]   Think about this next time you whine about Apple's policies."
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.000]   And I had to tweet back, "Dude, if people hadn't complained, you think about what would
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   have backed down?"
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.280]   They backed down because people whined.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.280]   They wanted to get it.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.800]   They tried to get away with it and they didn't.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   So it's interesting.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.080]   And they obviously pay attention to that.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.080]   I agree with you, Dan.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:41.800]   That was kind of a shocking about face from Apple.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.520]   So what else did they announce?
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   iOS 5?
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.320]   Anything exciting for you in the new iOS?
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   You were really an Android person in that genome.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.320]   I'm getting me fully Android.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.480]   I mean, you're surrounded.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   It sounds like, yeah.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.480]   You too?
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   Well, me too.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.680]   I'm getting a sense of the trolls and say, "Oh, it looks like iOS 5 really caught up
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.680]   to Android."
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.680]   Well, those notifications.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.680]   Okay.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   Now that I'm saying this to you guys.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   Oh, I'm ready now.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.880]   As Android users, doesn't that notification system look exactly like Android?
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.120]   It looks similar, yes.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.120]   Very similar.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.080]   The only difference is there's widgets in the notifications.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   Right, that's true.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   That's true.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   I have one last argument.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:18.920]   When people ask why you use Android over iOS, it was often like it was notifications, voice,
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.920]   input, and turn-by-turn directions.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.120]   So now I have one less thing that I can say kind of differentiates the two platforms.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.480]   I mean, not that-- listen, it's not a holy war, folks.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.280]   I'm really not trying to sense the trolls.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.000]   But no, it's great for iOS users who have this great experience.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.240]   You said notifications are terrible, so it's kind of a long time ago.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.240]   It was a big thing.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.840]   And I think still-- this was a little bit of a surprise.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.400]   I think everybody thought that Apple would announce a partnership with Nuance and that
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.640]   they would have dictation everywhere, which is another-- your second feature that you
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.280]   really like about Android phones.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.280]   And they did not.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.280]   Right.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.440]   And there have been some rumors that perhaps they were going to that-- this happens sometimes
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.160]   in Apple Keynote's last minute poll.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.840]   Maybe they couldn't do the deal with Nuance.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:02.160]   Nuance is notoriously tough to deal with, really tough negotiators.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:07.360]   And some people thought, if Nuance got word or rumor that Apple was interested in doing
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:12.800]   this, they might have made it very difficult for Apple to agree with that buy on the farm.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.280]   When they do this with Nuance, and I think it is when--
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.280]   I think they will do it.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.440]   It's going to be interesting because Nuance is a different religion than the Google approach
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.440]   to voice.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.200]   So the Nuance approach, if memory serves, is that they're going to do it on the phone,
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.520]   which means it's going to be very fast, but they don't have giant Google server farm to
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.120]   help them with the processing.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.000]   Whereas Google sends your voice back to Google+--
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Right.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.160]   --analyzes it and then does shockingly good voice analysis because they're doing it at the
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   Googleplex.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.160]   Right.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.160]   Send back to your phone.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.640]   But it only works when you're online and it's a little bit slower.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.640]   Right.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   You need data and it's slower.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.640]   Right.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   You need a connection and it's slower.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.760]   The interesting thing is the guy who founded Nuance is at Google.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.400]   I think his name is Mike Cohen.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.200]   He's the voice guy at Google.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.120]   But the Nuance he founded was a very different company from the Nuance.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.360]   Nuance, today, is really a holding company that took the name Nuance after they acquired
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.800]   Learnout and Houseby.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.120]   They acquired all T9--
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.120]   T9.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:09.480]   And they acquired everybody and then they wrapped it around the Nuance name, which they also
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.640]   acquired, basically.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.400]   So I don't know if it's the same technology or not.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.720]   I'm not sure.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.000]   It doesn't send the server on the iPhone.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.640]   You don't have to be online for the dictation to work.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   I don't know.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.200]   What I know is that Nuance has a lot of products, maybe even all the products--
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.680]   All the products are locally.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.680]   --are locally.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.680]   They don't do it in the cloud.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.480]   But you don't have a lot of processor and more importantly, you don't have a lot of RAM.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.840]   RAM is really important in voice strike conditions.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.840]   So I don't know.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   I'm not sure.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.080]   So it may be a snappier response, but worse quality.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.080]   Right.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   And they didn't do it.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.080]   Right.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.080]   They also--
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.080]   Right.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.080]   I guess this is all--
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.080]   So it doesn't move.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.080]   --it's all moose.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.120]   That would probably be the biggest thing is that it doesn't exist.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:50.280]   They also bought Siri, remember, which was a very interesting natural language app for
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:55.560]   the iPhone that allowed you to say, book me a table for two for Sunday night at Eel
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.480]   Franayo and it would do it.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.560]   It would hook into open table and other things.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.160]   You could tell it all sorts of stuff.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.320]   And they own it, but they didn't implement that either.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.600]   I believe that uses nuance.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.200]   As I remember, I talked to these Siri--
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.000]   Yeah, I believe Siri just did the analysis of the language once you'd already figured
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   out what the person had said.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Right.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.040]   And they were using nuance or just about anything to convert the voice.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.040]   It didn't really matter.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.040]   Got it.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:23.000]   Steve Jobs also, right after speaking at the Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.720]   on Tuesday, went to the Cupertino City Council and pitched a spaceship.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:33.000]   The new Apple building will house 12,000 people.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.640]   Steve says there is not a straight piece of glass in the place.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.040]   It's completely curved.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.440]   It's a ring.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.480]   Almost all the parking for tens of thousands of cars is underground.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.800]   They're adding trees, not taking out trees.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.880]   There'll be many, many more trees on the space.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.880]   It's part of the old HP campus.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.800]   It's the iPad of buildings.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.000]   It is the iPad.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.320]   You have to say after-- I had to even bring this up.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:02.240]   But after seeing Steve at the conference where he really looked frail and by the end
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.480]   of it, he was very tired.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:12.840]   You have to think that he's thinking of iOS 5, iCloud, Lion, and perhaps this building
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.840]   is his legacy.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.240]   Now, this building won't be started until 2015, I think.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.240]   I mean, it's a--
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.840]   I think they want a great ground next year.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.640]   Oh, maybe don't kids be done in 2015.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.760]   Great ground next year, done 2015.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:31.720]   So that's a monument to yourself, I'll tell you.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:35.000]   Yeah, I mean, his presentation in the city council really felt like a product announcement
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   to me.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   He did it.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   He did it.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   He just happened at this point.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   It is just happened.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   It was just happened.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   It was just happened with the numbers.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.520]   It was like, it had the same kind of cadence and build up and everyone was just like, "Wow,
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.840]   it stars in their eyes afterwards.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.960]   It felt very much like a product announcement."
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:49.960]   It's pretty cool.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.440]   Are you guys gamers at all?
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   Very casually, very casually.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.640]   Well, look at these three stuff in the just a second.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.880]   We'll talk about the Nintendo Wii U!
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.880]   Wii U!
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.080]   But first a word from our friends at FreshBooks.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.080]   FreshBooks.com is the place to go if you do invoicing.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.680]   Anybody who's-- well, you probably still do invoicing, don't you?
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.680]   Okay, generally.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:17.320]   Anybody who's been a freelancer or a self-employed knows about the pain, the horror that comes
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:22.920]   on the 31st day of the month when you have to make invoices and get paid for all your
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   clients.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.160]   I was doing it and hated it until Amber MacArthur.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.000]   This was, I think, 2004.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Told me about a company called FreshBooks.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.440]   In fact, I remember when I first saw the site, I said, "Wow, this is my first--"
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.960]   This is like the first Web 2.0 site I've seen.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.280]   It had the Web 2.0 look, the big buttons, the big text.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.720]   Very friendly, very readable.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   You know what?
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.520]   Here we are some years later.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.920]   I think 2 million people since have signed up for FreshBooks.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.960]   It changed my life.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.800]   Their tagline, "Love invoicing."
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.880]   That sounds-- yeah, right.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.760]   I will never-- no.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.760]   You might.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   Seriously.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:06.120]   For instance, if you do time and hours, they have a tracker on the Web or on the iPhone
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.720]   that automatically puts those hours and numbers right into the invoice.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.040]   If you use multiple currencies, I did.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.480]   I had to build Canada.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.560]   It'll automatically do the currencies.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:17.840]   Everything I like is you can have automatic invoicing.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.240]   If it's the same invoice every month, it'll do it automatically for you.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.440]   You can even-- your clients can even set up auto pay.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.800]   Now, that's how you get paid quickly.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.680]   They can press a button on the email that says, "Pay by credit card," or one of 11 different
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.040]   online payment services like PayPal and authorized.net.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:41.280]   If your clients are the other kind of client, the ones that take a while to pay, automated
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:45.880]   late payment reminders will make sure that they don't forget about you.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.120]   Some clients even still want paper invoices.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.760]   They'll do that too for an additional fee.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.080]   They'll print, stamp, and mail your invoice.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.280]   It really is a great service.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   Here's the best part.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.320]   Free for the first three clients.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.440]   Many of us, that's all you need.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.640]   It's not a temporary one time only.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:07.680]   It's free for the first three clients, period.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.800]   I think you're going to love it.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   I did it.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   I've done it.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.120]   I highly recommend it and I encourage you to try it.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:18.440]   Yes, they're still giving birthday cakes every week to new users.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.920]   If you sign up today, you'll be in the drawing for a free birthday cake, even if it's not
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.400]   your birthday.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.400]   It's good birthday cake.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.400]   We had one.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.400]   You weren't here.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.400]   See, this is why you should be here.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.400]   This is why I clearly should be here.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.760]   The cake isn't a lie?
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.400]   The cake in this case.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.120]   You are a gamer.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.120]   It's not a lie.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:35.800]   Sorry, just kind of handed that one.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   I gave you that one.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.080]   Dan Shapiro is here.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.760]   He's a newly minted Googler.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.920]   I know we can't ask you questions about Google and stuff.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.480]   Can I ask you personal questions?
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.480]   How is that?
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.840]   Was it kind of cool to walk in the door and say, "Here I am"?
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.840]   Oh my gosh.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.000]   I'll tell you one thing.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.040]   You hear all the stuff about the Google benefits and the food and it's all true.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.040]   You're going to get real fat.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.040]   It's a really light dance.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.040]   It's a really nice.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.040]   Do you ever leave?
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.960]   Not only is the food amazing, they color-coat it.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.960]   There's green for healthy, good for you.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.720]   Yellow perceived with caution and red for taste really, really good.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.720]   No, for a joy in moderation.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.040]   That's actually good that they do that because they probably initially had a problem with
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.560]   people, you know, the Google 15, right?
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.560]   Right.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.560]   Right.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:18.400]   I just got a head start on that.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.280]   So I was so much better.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.280]   Very tempting.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.280]   It must be.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:26.000]   I saw pictures of the Googleplex of them making cheeseburgers with Krispy Kreme donut
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   buns.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   That's probably red.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   That's red.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   I'm thinking that's bright red.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   That's like, "Let's kill our employees."
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.800]   That's all like, "We'll do that for the ones we want to get rid of."
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.640]   The medic's on site as well.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.400]   So it must be fun though.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.240]   I know that what you love to do is create businesses.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.240]   That is a lot of fun.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.680]   It's also really amazing to go see how a phenomenal business runs at scale and be a
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.680]   part of that.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.560]   Well, here's something you can learn, isn't it?
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.200]   Because the real challenge is to have, what do they have?
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.720]   40,000, 50,000 employees and still feel like a startup, still feel nimble, feel like things
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   are happening.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.720]   Hey, come on in.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:00.720]   Kevin Marks is here.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.720]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.880]   Sitting in for Ben, huh?
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.760]   You could take that mic right there.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.920]   Now it's feeling like this week in Google all of a sudden.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.920]   It is.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.920]   I like that.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   It's weeks taken over.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.240]   Kevin was also at Food Camp.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.120]   In fact, he's wearing this year's...
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   He's model...
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.640]   Kevin Marks is modeling this year's Food Camp shirt.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.640]   And badge.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   This is 2004.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.640]   Oh, that's the old one?
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.640]   Kevin's an older time.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   Oh, they're right.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   The current ones.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.640]   Scooch in.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.640]   Scooch in.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.640]   They get right on that mic.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   You have to talk right into it.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.640]   But they're green again this year.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   So it looked exactly the same.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   It's slightly dark over here.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.040]   Well, see, that's how you know it has a food camp.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.040]   The pros now.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:39.480]   Well, as you probably could tell if you were a food camp regular like me, this is the
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.480]   2004.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.480]   Hey, can I get...
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.240]   Can we get water all around?
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.480]   And maybe even a coffee would be nice.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.480]   Thank you, Angel.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.920]   How many hours of sleep did you get last night?
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.920]   Not much.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.920]   You don't sleep at Food Camp.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.920]   That's a mistake.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.920]   You sleep when you're dead.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.400]   Or have been killed by werewolves.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.400]   Well, right.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.880]   I was dead, unfortunately, many times last night.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.000]   You don't sleep at Food Camp because there's so many amazing people and there's no...
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.800]   You cannot get to everybody.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.800]   They make it so you can't...
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.400]   There's no way you get to all the sessions.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.400]   There are at least...
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   At a time?
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.400]   Something like that.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.400]   More than that, 10.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.720]   Yeah, there's quite a few simultaneous sessions.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.480]   So it's impossible to get to every session.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:21.840]   And one of the things people do at Food Camp, besides sessions and having a laying werewolf
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.360]   is talking a lot, a lot to different people.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.440]   And you actively look for new people that, you know, if you're smart, you look for new...
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.680]   Which is why, am I excused for not talking to you, I'm more into it.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.000]   I should have talked to you more about it.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Well, yeah, we actually didn't...
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   No.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Well, we hung out a bit, but not...
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.040]   I really make an effort to try to meet new people.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   I did too.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   So much fun.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.400]   So Kevin is good to see you.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.640]   Kevin Marks is at Salesforce.com now.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.120]   New job for Kevin.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.120]   Kevin Marks...
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.120]   Is it Kevin?
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   No, it says Kevin Marks.com on here, but that's not your blog.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.960]   It's a pay us at Good Knee.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.400]   But Kevin's worked at like all of the big four?
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   No.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.400]   Not...
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.400]   So Apple, Google...
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.400]   The Horseman.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   You haven't worked at Facebook.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.400]   Okay.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.040]   And who's the other one?
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.040]   Amazon.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.040]   Have you worked at Amazon?
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.040]   Amazon.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.040]   Amazon.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.040]   So three of the four?
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.040]   So you're 75%?
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.040]   No, I'm 75%.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   Okay.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   So 50%.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.040]   Are you working on cloud stuff at Salesforce?
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.040]   Cloud standards.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.280]   Working on getting the stuff that Salesforce building connected to the open standards in the
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.600]   cloud, the activity stream stuff, and so on.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.400]   And Salesforce is very much involved in big data.
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:31.800]   We were talking earlier about big data and how interested.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.960]   That seemed to be one of the threads of conversation that was going on there.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.400]   What do you do with data?
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.000]   How do you learn from it?
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.320]   I was talking to Andreas.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   Is it Vigant?
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.320]   Yes.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.360]   Who's a professor at Stanford?
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.760]   And a big data whiz.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.880]   And he was eating a hot dog at the time.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.560]   And I said, "So what do you do with big data?
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.560]   Do you...
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.160]   Do you ask questions and it gives you an answer?"
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.960]   And he goes, "Oh, it's iterative.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:58.960]   Yes, it's iterative.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.960]   You ask a question.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.960]   It gives you an answer.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.960]   You ask another question.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:02.960]   It gives you an answer.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.960]   And you iterate.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   Oh, I got it.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.960]   So this is good.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.920]   He's a good enough lecturer that actually could learn with sign language.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.200]   For those who are listening, the sign was he made his finger go around in circles.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.680]   But we're going to get him on actually.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.680]   It was very interesting.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.480]   I asked him to be here, but he couldn't.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.040]   But we'll get him on in a later chat.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.440]   There was another conference this week.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:22.480]   The Economist put on in Santa Clara that was all about that.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.920]   Yeah, you were at that as well.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:30.440]   In fact, you did a session called, which I thought was fascinating, Cloud versus Pocket.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:38.800]   So the challenge is we are simultaneously putting all information in the Cloud and having
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:42.520]   their, for reference, Steve Jobs said the truth is in the Cloud.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.520]   But we're also kind of...
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.760]   Did he actually say the truth is in the Cloud?
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   That's all scary.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:50.720]   But at the same time, we're carrying around more and more stuff with us all the time.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.600]   We have more local storage.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.080]   And that used to be a thousand songs in your pocket.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.720]   Now it's 25,000 songs in the Cloud.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   So the question becomes which, you know, which should be master, which should be right.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.680]   And the trend has been the Cloud has the right answer and the stuff in your pocket is just
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.960]   a local cash for it.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.960]   Which is...
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960]   That's Apple's vision, I think.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.960]   But it's all yours.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.960]   Because that's the way Google was built, too, with Android.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.960]   You get a new Android.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.440]   All your contacts appear from the Cloud automatically.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.360]   And you don't really know when you save it where it is.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.440]   Apple did seem to be a little bit less focused on the Cloud, a little bit more interested
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.680]   in local storage.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.680]   But it's also emphasized again and again that it will go up to the Cloud and come back
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.160]   down to your other devices.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.160]   Yes.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.160]   That's true.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.400]   Responding, I think, to a concern.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400]   Some people, I don't share it.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.120]   But some people have that, "Oh, if my stuff's in the Cloud, is it safe?
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.120]   I want a local copy of it?"
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120]   Yes.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.120]   As well.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:42.960]   There is value in heaven that it works offline.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960]   So that's...
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:50.720]   Apple showed off their Doc's integration with the Cloud, which means that you can have
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.400]   edit histories and have old versions.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.840]   And those get persisted, but it's certainly for you.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.840]   It's not collaborative editing like Google.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.040]   The presumption is you laid it and then a copy will be saved.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.560]   So it's more like source code control than it is like that.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.280]   So that is one of the models.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:17.800]   The problems we've got is the presumption that you have two classes of device now.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.800]   You have service and you have clients again.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.880]   We're back to that model.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.080]   And as we start engineering stuff for the net, there is a danger that we build things
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:32.160]   with this very split view of things.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.120]   It's an old view and an incorrect...
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.920]   Well, if you don't want to carry with us.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.520]   Well, it's weird in that...
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.480]   I had this when I was trying to...
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.560]   A couple of years ago, I went to the W3C thing, was talking about the social standards,
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.920]   was talking about OAuth.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.480]   And to all the Tim Berners-Lee about that, he said, "Why do you need this?
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.400]   Why do you need one server to give permission to another server?
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.200]   Why don't you just run something locally that talks to them?"
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.520]   And the answer is, "No, you can't really anymore."
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.760]   Because the thing locally hasn't got a persistent IP address.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.800]   So the remote thing can't call back to you.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.040]   You have to poke out and establish a connection first.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.320]   It has to be pull every time.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.040]   And if you think about what Tim Berners-Lee was able to do with the machine he had, that
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.480]   was because it was globally routable and anyone can connect to it and get stuff from it.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.920]   So there's a tension there, which is quite a subtle one in our engineering thinking,
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.440]   which is that we tend to think, "Oh, there are servers that are server protocols, and
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.640]   then there are all the clients that talk to the edges."
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.840]   And you're either running some of the server, or you're running some of the client.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.920]   You have that with ThinkUp.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.160]   You have to post it on a server.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:38.440]   And it's interesting to see some of the developments around that.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.040]   There's a thing called the Locker Project.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.040]   Don't you've seen that?
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040]   No.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.640]   The Locker Project, it's by Jeremy Miller and some others, Jeremy Miller is a venture
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.720]   of Java.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:53.400]   And the idea is to have your own information stored on your own device and root it around
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.320]   there rather than stored on a server.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.880]   But it doesn't rely on a central database to connect things.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:07.680]   It uses a distributed hash table so that you can discover other people without there being
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.160]   a central service to look them up in.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.080]   So you can send messages across the edges that way.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.520]   And that was one of these interesting pieces that's trying to move this the other way.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:24.320]   And the other thing that we touched a bit on there was the idea of we're starting to
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.560]   use, if you look at the Node.js and the way that's come through, people are starting to
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.520]   write server software in JavaScript and client software in JavaScript.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.960]   We're using the same data structures on both sides, not on the same code.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.600]   And we're just migrating bits and pieces back and forth as needed.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.160]   And so you suddenly become straightforward to package up a bit of information and some
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.560]   code and send it to somewhere else to process and bring it back again.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.360]   So there's a bunch of these trends that are sort of happening together.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.120]   And I think we maybe do a swing back to more stuff at the edges again.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.200]   From the point of view of a user, because I mean really this is kind of inside baseball
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.840]   talk for developer point of view, what it looks like from the point of view of the developer,
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.720]   what is the user wants?
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:11.320]   And by the way, I distinguish the user, not enterprise, not businesses.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.840]   But now with iCloud and with Google, we're all using the cloud as end users.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.760]   What does the end user want?
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.760]   What are they?
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.840]   What should it look like to us?
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:27.120]   What it looks like to us is we get to share things with each other without having to post
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.880]   them to the large service.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.880]   That's the, if you've got an edge-driven vision.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.880]   That's what Apple's saying.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:37.400]   They're going to save to set up their own large service.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.800]   So we want it, and this was a great conversation.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.120]   Because we're really trying to figure out, well, what do we want?
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.520]   How should it be done?
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.000]   I mean, Apple sells really shiny devices with big hard drives.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.760]   They have an interest in making sure that you have a local copy.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.440]   But there's a really good user.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.720]   I mean, users benefit from federated, distributed, decentralized data stores.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.480]   It means that they can get to their data when they're offline.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.240]   They can get their data when that service is down.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.240]   They can share.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.720]   And they actually have the bits on them.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.520]   I feel better about that.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   We talked a little bit about federation.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:15.200]   The notion that you could have multiple servers that talk to each other.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.000]   And that in some way, do they federate to form a single or looks like a single data
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.760]   store or are there conversations going in between all of them?
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.440]   The conversations, which you're talking about.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:32.160]   If you look at the approaches to try and build federated social networks.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.360]   Status net, which is the old identity, which is Evan Podromo's project.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.760]   I mean, this is how the web works, right?
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.200]   We're all just a node on the network.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.160]   The web is federated.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:39.640]   Right.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.640]   Email is federated.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.000]   Email is federated.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.400]   Use net's federated.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.040]   Newsgroups.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.400]   So BitTorrent.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.480]   Yeah, BitTorrent.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.320]   Is it federated?
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:47.760]   I don't know.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.760]   We all have our parts of our copy or copy.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   Yeah, Bitcoin.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.680]   Bitcoin's federated.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.920]   We're going to talk about Bitcoin.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920]   We're going to talk about Bitcoin.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.360]   We're not needing a tracker to not needing a tracker.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.360]   That's the other thing.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.040]   You just need the file and it'll discover all the other users with the group of hash
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.040]   tables, too.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.720]   Yeah, that was a good move, actually.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.800]   It was a very interesting move.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:10.080]   We're talking about the news of the week, but also throwing in some food camp stuff,
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.680]   too, which is a lot of fun.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.800]   In some ways, I think food camps should be the news of the week.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:20.000]   Story we missed because we were incognito at food camp.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:28.160]   Spain arrested three anonymous members for the Sony hacks and the bank hacks.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:35.440]   Three people being suspected of involved in attacks against Sony, Spanish banks, BBVA
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.200]   and Bancia, Italian energy company NL and the governments of Egypt, Algeria, Libya,
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.160]   Iran, Chile, Colombia and New Zealand.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.720]   These guys have been busy and been arrested in Spain.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:52.720]   All three claimed were the police claimed were the leadership of anonymous in Spain.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.720]   I don't know how you would know that.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.600]   I don't think they had a leadership.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.600]   I don't know.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.600]   Yeah, I don't know what that means.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.600]   I don't even know.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:06.040]   The individuals are accused of performing and organizing large DDoS attacks.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.680]   They also were claimed to have attacked the websites of Spain's central electoral board
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.680]   on May 18th.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.680]   That's where you get in trouble, by the way.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.680]   We've learned.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.680]   Don't attack that.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:19.720]   You can do a rasmus lurdoff, the creator of PHP.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.360]   He talked about how he got ingest the slightest...
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.040]   We're going to fix the mic there for you, Kevin.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.280]   Just the slightest bit of trouble when he was in Australia.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.600]   He was in Tasmania doing a talk.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.400]   He was demonstrating cross-site scripting.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:40.600]   It happened to be that one of the government websites in Tasmania was vulnerable to a pretty
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.160]   good cross-site scripting act.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.160]   We just demonstrated it.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.160]   It's just a demo.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.160]   He was arrested.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.680]   He found out, in fact, that...
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.480]   First of all, he was arrested and everybody was up in arms until the Hobart police in
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.760]   Tasmania said, "We're going to cut off internet access to the conference at which point I'm
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.760]   looking for."
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.920]   He said, "Rasmus, you suck!"
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.000]   And then, "Go take him.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.800]   We don't want..."
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.840]   And it turns out it's a 10-year...
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.800]   Could be 10 years in prison.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.120]   And "Rasmus," he says, "I don't know how I got out, but I managed to get out."
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:16.240]   He says, "I can't go back though."
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:24.640]   So the funniest thing is that he's trying to describe to them what...
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.840]   Cross-site scripting hack, which, in fact, doesn't in any way affect the server the computer.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:29.840]   It's running on.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.920]   It's a way of getting to somebody else's computer on a cross-site scripting.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.200]   He said, "They were asking, 'Should we format our computers now?
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.120]   Have you breached our security?
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.000]   Are we... what should we do now?"
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   He said, "No, no.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   You don't understand.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   I did nothing.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   I did nothing!"
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.280]   Anyway, so that's interesting.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.280]   I don't know if these guys are from anonymous.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.440]   This would be kind of a shock.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.000]   It seemed like anonymous pretty much had covered their tracks.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.280]   Well, the thing about anonymous, right, is that it's a lot of...
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.280]   Decentralized.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.080]   Yes, it's a lot of people.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.000]   And people are individually, quite silly sometimes.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.600]   So it doesn't surprise me at all that there were some subset of anonymous.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600]   Maybe not even anonymous.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.600]   Well, what?
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.600]   Well, what...
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.600]   Or claimed to be it, or they just chattrooped.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   Or they just messed up, right?
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.400]   They bragged somewhere or didn't use Tor properly.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.400]   There's lots of ways to not do a good job of being anonymous.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.400]   Yes, indeed.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.400]   Yes, indeed.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.960]   It could have just, frankly, been a couple of guys who were using that low-week tool,
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.400]   a low-lyc tool and got caught.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   They didn't protect themselves well enough or whatever.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   And of course, the police are going to say, "We have the leaders!"
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.960]   We have arrested the leaders!
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.400]   By the way, anonymous ops, Val revenge.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.400]   So...
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.400]   They already took off the Spanish police offline, I think.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400]   Oh, Kidoki.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.400]   So it begins.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.400]   It's interesting.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   I mean, it's actually a little bit scary.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:57.320]   I mean, law enforcement has to be a little nervous about the whole idea that...
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.400]   They're hardening websites.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.720]   Yeah, the Wall Street Journal is reporting, "Anonymous hackers claim retaliatory attack
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.880]   on Spain police."
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880]   Wow.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.880]   Wow.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880]   Didn't take long.
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.840]   E3 happened this week.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   We had E3 coverage.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.080]   I hope you watched it if you didn't.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.560]   It's on our Twitch specials feed.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:18.720]   Brian Brushwood and I, and Glenn Rubenstein, we're at E3 on Tuesday.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.720]   It's always a fun.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.080]   It's a really loud, garish, sexy conference.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.200]   I think it's a last technology conference where they have women in scantily clothed
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.000]   women, and not actually just women, but men.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.360]   I mean, there are guys, Conan the Barbarian outfits.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.200]   Don't try and make this like, you know, everything.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.200]   No, it's sexy women.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.200]   Okay, it's sexy women.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.200]   It's straight up sexist.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.200]   It's straight up anti-women.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.200]   It is an equal.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.160]   No, I have to admit.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.160]   And I always, you know, it's just...
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.160]   Thank you, Dan.
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   Thank you.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.160]   You're right, Dan.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.160]   What am I saying?
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.160]   Sorry.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.160]   I lost my head briefly.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.160]   There's that one shirtless guy.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.560]   There was a shirtless guy.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.560]   Okay, I saw him.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.240]   He wasn't so good looking, but there was...
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.240]   Really it was Leo.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.240]   It was me.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.240]   I love my shirt.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.280]   Actually, there's a picture somewhere of Brian Brushwood and me.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.920]   We saw Duke Nukem Forever.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:06.920]   It exists.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.080]   It's going to be out next week.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.080]   Holy cow.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.480]   You see you guys are looking me like blank, but that's exciting.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.760]   It's a little while in the making.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.560]   Oh, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little bit.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.560]   You got the picture.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.200]   All right, the chat room has pulled up the picture.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.680]   So at the Duke Nukem Forever booth, they have...
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:32.840]   Apparently, there's a scene in the game where Duke sits in a throne surrounded by two school
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.840]   girls.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.080]   So they had a throne with adult women dressed as school girls in the plaid skirts and the
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.080]   whole...
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.080]   Classic.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.080]   Yeah, classy.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.080]   And imaginative.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.080]   Well, I thought I'm going to sit and throw, but I'm going to do something a little different.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.080]   I'm going to have Brian sit in my lap.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.080]   Oh, I like that.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.080]   Okay.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.080]   So that made it okay, right?
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.760]   The women look amused.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.760]   They were puzzled.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.040]   And they look like they're trying to avoid being stabbed by Brian's hair.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.360]   Yeah, they were puzzled.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.360]   We had a good time.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.400]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:05.840]   I think the big announcement at E3 this year was Nintendo's Wii U, which is a...
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.680]   Do you have to pronounce it that way?
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:09.680]   Is that the kinetic?
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.680]   Well, let me put it this way.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.480]   If you're the kind of person that's pronounced Wii, Wii.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.480]   Then you have to pronounce it.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.920]   Then you have to say Wii U.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.920]   It's a strange name.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.720]   W-I-I space capital U. It is a new...
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.800]   It will be out next year.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.480]   We don't have a price announced for it.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.160]   It is a new successor to the Nintendo Wii.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.920]   High death, finally, which is good.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.120]   And a little bit more aimed at the hardcore gamer.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.360]   But the thing that was interesting is it has an iPad looking device with an accelerometer
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.960]   and a gyroscope and game controls on it and a full screen, touch screen that you use as
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.520]   a controller in addition to your Wii mokes and your nunchucks.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.000]   Something that wasn't totally clear to me.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.240]   Was that thing that we use?
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   Or was that the controller?
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.360]   No, the Wii was a whole new game machine.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:51.360]   Okay, so it's good.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.360]   But the controller comes with it.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.960]   A box with an iPad-like controller.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.960]   And buttons plus touch screen?
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.240]   And gyroscope and you know, and position it.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:04.840]   So you could walk around like that or you could have it like a DS experience where this
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.360]   is a controller that you touch or there's a map there as you wander in a dungeon.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.040]   It actually was kind of cool for multiplayer because now we don't know how much you're
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   going to cost.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.240]   But if each person has one of these, they all have their individual screen and then
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.080]   there's the big game on top on the big screen.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.360]   It was interesting.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.000]   Tony also announced a new product.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.080]   They call it the Vita.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:28.040]   It's basically the successor to the PlayStation Portable.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.720]   And I had to wonder, is there a market for this now that we all have smartphones that
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.320]   we can play games with?
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   Does anybody really want to buy a portable gaming thing?
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.320]   Dedicated.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.320]   Dedicated gamers, right?
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.320]   Maybe.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   Just like real photographers.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.080]   It's like the DSLR of gaming devices.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.080]   Portable gaming.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   Turn 50 bucks.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.720]   I bought one bump in my pocket rule.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.720]   That's the only bump I allow in my pocket.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.720]   Okay.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.280]   I'm not going to say anything at all.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.840]   I apologize for even thinking it.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.840]   But I just have a feeling I'm not alone.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840]   That's all.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840]   All right.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.840]   We're going to take a little break.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.840]   Dan Shapiro's here.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.840]   Kevin Marks has joined us.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.840]   It's great to have you.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.840]   Kevin Marks.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.840]   How's Salesforce been?
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:11.840]   Is it fun?
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.840]   It's great fun.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.840]   There was some interesting Salesforce people there, including JP.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.840]   Yes.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:16.840]   Who is, I tried to get here.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.840]   Was he Salesforce?
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.840]   JP Salesforce.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.640]   We're going to explain where we have to explain where Wolf for Peter who don't know anything
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.640]   about it.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.960]   Kevin, you played where Wolf too.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.200]   I'm not last night at that.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.200]   I played a little bit.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.200]   I played with you, I think.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200]   I think I did.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200]   There were a number of Brits.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.200]   You know why I'm playing with Brits?
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.200]   They're very...
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.200]   You know the husband and wife?
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.200]   Simon and...
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.200]   Oh, I can remember his wife.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.200]   Natalie.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.200]   Natalie.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.200]   Natalie.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.200]   You know their story?
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.200]   They founded a startup called Lanyard, which is very cool.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.200]   Lanyard is awesome.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.760]   LA and YRD.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.360]   There's no A and land.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.840]   There's only one A and Lanyard.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:59.520]   But the story was they were traveling around the world on their honeymoon and they got
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.800]   to Morocco and they were kind of not feeling well and it was Ramadan.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.800]   So they couldn't go to...
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.520]   And they were kind of in an area where they couldn't go out to eat.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.000]   So they had a rent an apartment and they were in this apartment not feeling too well
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   for three, four weeks.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.520]   So he's a Ruby on Rails programmer.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.520]   She's a UX person.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.560]   So they wrote Lanyard on their honeymoon.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.600]   I didn't realize that was them.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.600]   It's heard that story.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.400]   It's a great story.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.080]   We're going to get them on one of our shows.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.080]   They were charming.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.080]   Oh, they're adorable.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.040]   Wonderful couple.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.480]   And they've got this great startup.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.240]   I think they just closed around a financing pretty recently.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.600]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600]   No, no, no.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.800]   This is what happened.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.040]   So they get into Y Combinator.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.640]   They write Lanyard and then they get into Y Combinator.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.680]   So they move out here and they go through the Y Combinator thing and then I think they
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.680]   got funding.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.680]   That's just a great.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:55.240]   It's just one of those wild stories that shows you in some ways it's very inspiring
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:00.280]   that just a couple of people who have some skills and a good idea and they're stuck
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.400]   in the house for a while.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.320]   And on their honeymoon thinking about conferences.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.120]   Well, that's a little sick, but we're not.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.120]   We're not.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.120]   We're not.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   We're all.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.040]   It's just and they were adorable and playing werewolf was fun with them because they would
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.680]   kill each other and that was always fun.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:20.240]   So there was a great moment where somebody said, ask your husband if he's the werewolf and
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:23.480]   she stares deep into his eyes and says, are you a werewolf?
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.800]   Very intense moment.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.400]   I'm not a werewolf.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.720]   And she looks at it real says, I can't vouch for that.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:30.720]   Kill him.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.720]   That was the end.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.760]   And she had a little thing she said now, if he giggles when I do this, are you a werewolf?
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.480]   And she and she does her eyebrows and he giggled.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.640]   So we had to kill him.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.640]   We had no choice.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.640]   Ironically, he wasn't.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.640]   It was kind of sad actually.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.200]   They ended up kind of at each other's throats and I don't know how that marriage is going
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.200]   to go.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.720]   But anyway, we wish him the best.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:54.720]   No, we're just kidding.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.080]   They were actually were really, really sweet.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.080]   So let's take a break.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.080]   We're going to move on.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.000]   We have a great cast of characters here with us.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.320]   We're going to wrap up pretty soon because we're going to get you to the airport.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.320]   I'm absolutely worried.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.320]   We'll get there.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.480]   We'll get you the airport.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.560]   And we've got a lot of visitors in studio, which is a lot of fun.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560]   And we've got Kevin Marks and we'll get Dan Shapiro.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.480]   I just, you know, Gina's never been to the cottage.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.480]   So it's just really fun.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.480]   You know, it's fantastic.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:20.520]   I just keep kind of gazing around like this is where all the magic happens.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.640]   I only get to see you from my office in San Diego.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.920]   I'm glad you came now because, you know, we're probably that you won't get another chance
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920]   to see it.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.920]   It'll be this mantle next time.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:29.920]   It'll be the brick house.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:30.920]   I'm excited.
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.160]   You'll like the brick house, I think.
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.160]   And this cottage is adorable.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.160]   It is a cottage.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.160]   It is.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   It is very.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.480]   Pick a fence, roses out front, old push button lights.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.520]   We could be in, I don't know, we could be in the UK.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.520]   We could be.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.120]   And I love that it's lined with programming books.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.120]   Yes.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.600]   All Riley or Riley books.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.960]   They're all, they're my personal, this is my personal, my wife.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.200]   The reason actually basically we're here is my wife threw my programming books out of
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.200]   the house.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.200]   I followed.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.000]   She said, you can't have those books on the shelf anymore.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.560]   They're confusing.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.560]   What is this Python?
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.600]   I keep seeing a snake.
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.920]   I don't know.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.720]   So this show brought to you by our friends at audible.com.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:14.600]   If you are not yet listening to audio books, what the heck?
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.600]   Get it, get going.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:23.520]   Go on over there to audible.com/twit2 for your chance to get two free books, two, not
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.960]   just one, two free books.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.560]   And I can tell you what the first one should be.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.120]   This is very excited.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.560]   Very exciting.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.680]   Paul Therrot was referring to this.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.920]   In fact, Paul wanted to make it his pick on Windows Weekly on Thursday.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.560]   I said, you can't.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.800]   Because we're going to talk about it.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:48.840]   They have done Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, a brand new recording which just came out just
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.520]   a few days ago of Solaris.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.640]   They call it the definitive edition, one of the great works of science fiction.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.640]   You may remember the movie.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.760]   Actually, there were two movies.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.680]   There was a Steven Soderbergh version of it.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:06.080]   And then there's an Russian movie, which is on Netflix, by the way.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   This is the 50th anniversary of the publication of Solaris.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:16.960]   And they've commissioned a brand new translation for the first time ever from Polish to English.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:21.320]   And it's narrated by, let's see if Gina gets her street creds here.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.800]   I'll play you a little segment.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   Ooh.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.760]   You tell me who this is.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.920]   At 1900 hours, ships time, I climbed down the metal ladder past the bays on either side.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:33.000]   Alessandro Giuliani, do you know that name?
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.040]   There was just enough room to raise my elbows after I tapped the metal.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.240]   Battle star Galactica, that ring about?
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.640]   It's a little echo, the way I'm playing it right here.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.560]   So I apologize for that.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.480]   So you may not be able to hear.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.680]   Or rather hung suspended in a bed of air.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.560]   All of one piece with my metal shell.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.560]   Now she's squeaking.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.560]   I love him.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:57.400]   He was one of my feet.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:58.720]   Which one is he?
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.440]   He was the, um, with the curls, the dark curls.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.480]   Oh, I can't remember his character name.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.480]   Alessandro Giuliani.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.480]   Felix Gider.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480]   Felix Gider.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:12.960]   He was, yeah, he was, he was, he was great.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.760]   He had a great webisode.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.760]   I'm so sad.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:16.760]   Did he really?
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.760]   One of the webisodes kind of really dives into his personal life.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.760]   Felix.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.760]   He's one of my people.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.760]   I love him.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:29.680]   So, uh, this is, uh, the, the story in brief is, uh, Chris Kelvin arrives on an orbiting
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:34.280]   research station to study the remarkable ocean covering the planet's surface.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.280]   But his fellow scientists appear to be losing their grip on reality.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:42.720]   I was like that plagued by physical manifestations of their repressed memories.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.160]   When Kelvin's long dead wife suddenly appears, he's forced to confront the pain of his past
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.200]   while living in a future that never was.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.360]   Can Kelvin unlock the mystery of Solaris?
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.520]   Does he even want to find out?
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.720]   Listen to the book.
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.200]   The definitive edition, brand new translation, brand new recording.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.200]   You're going to love this.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.200]   This sounds great.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.200]   I love Audible.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.200]   So you can get it right now for free.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.960]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.760]   That's just the first, you get two books by the way.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.760]   He's trying to hear Lieutenant Guided's voice.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.760]   I know.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:11.760]   I want him to write it.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.760]   I know.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.760]   Are we allowed?
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:15.760]   Awesome.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:16.760]   Are we allowed?
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:17.760]   I love it.
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.760]   He was.
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.920]   I think that's the first time that we've had a host sign up for Audible because of it right
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.920]   on the spot.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.920]   I love it.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:24.920]   Uh, so if you go to audible.com/twit2, that's just the first, you get two books by the way.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.360]   You go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.360]   You're signing up for the platinum account.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.960]   That's two books a month.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:31.960]   That's what I do.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.920]   And it's kind of the, you know, it's a subscription.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.480]   Your first month's free though.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:38.240]   And you guess who you get two books and you can cancel at any time in those books you
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.240]   can keep.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.240]   They don't go away.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:43.920]   Uh, in fact, that's one of the things I really love about Audible is that you have
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.920]   a library.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.400]   I have a, I don't know how many books do I have?
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.400]   I think 500 books now.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.120]   I've been an Audible subscriber for more than a decade.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:54.760]   So, um, let's see what all, if I go to all the books, so they're always in your library.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:58.200]   If you have the iPhone app or the Android app, that library is on the phone and you can
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:01.200]   look at any book, listen to any book that you've ever listened to.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:06.480]   So it really is, what's wonderful about Audible is it really is a library.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:07.960]   Your audio book library.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.640]   And as I listen to more and more audio books, I just, I feel like I've rediscovered reading,
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640]   thanks to Audible.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:14.640]   It's just a really great service.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.960]   I want you to try it free for, uh, two books, absolutely free.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:24.160]   Just go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.200]   If you're already an Audible member, they've got a summer listening sale going on right
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.960]   now up to half off on many, many books.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.160]   And yeah, that would be the good one to start with.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:35.160]   Solaris, Stanisaw, Lamb, read by Lieutenant Geida.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.320]   Uh, let's say thank you Audible for your support.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.240]   Um, what else is I going to talk about?
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.680]   You know, our fearless moderator from last night just arrived.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.280]   Who's our fearless moderator?
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.440]   Quinn from Quinn.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.280]   Come on in here.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.320]   Get a seat for Quinn.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.320]   How did she even find us?
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.320]   Quinn's sitting there very quietly.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.560]   Quinn was pushing, uh, pushing absence.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.040]   The dead of night.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.040]   And, uh, some lemon thing that was made out of rubbing alcohol, I believe.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.840]   Can we get a seat for Quinn?
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.720]   All right, we've got my people are scrambling right now.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:12.000]   It's so nice to see you.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.200]   I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, how did you find?
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:20.640]   I didn't, I didn't know if he wanted to be outed, so I didn't, I didn't call you out.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.880]   So you'll have to share a mic with Dan.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:27.720]   I hope you don't mind getting close there and, uh, what time do you need to go to the
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   airport?
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.560]   Yeah, I should probably, I should probably take off.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.560]   Well, we're going to wrap up in a second.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.560]   Okay.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.560]   So Quinn, what do you do?
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.560]   Tell us, introduce yourself.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.360]   Oh, well, I'm a journalist and, uh, I also...
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.640]   You have to really lean in on that sucker.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:46.960]   Um, I'm a journalist and I also just finished up a teaching at ITP on, uh, Physiology and
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:50.000]   Identity, a, a class called the Laboratory of the Self.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   Wow.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.360]   What does that mean?
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:59.720]   Well, um, I look at the, uh, physiological part of human identity and body augmentation
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:03.840]   in the past through history and then, pro, prospectively in the future.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.000]   When you say augmentation, does that mean like piercings and tattoos or does it mean
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   like horns?
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   I mean, what is...
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   Yes.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.800]   Um, it's, uh, it's actually, when I started looking at it, I was looking at functional body
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:15.800]   modification and I...
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   Functional, as opposed to decorative.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.800]   Yes.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:23.080]   I mean, decorative ends up being a really important part of human history, but, um, but the functional
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.080]   was my main interest.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.080]   So would that be, uh...
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.840]   Well, you see, this is the thing is I started out looking at things like, um, the magnetic
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.800]   implant to get yourself a sixth sense for, um, electromagnetic fields, but when I started...
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:37.680]   Quinn told us a funny story about that.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.680]   Which story?
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.160]   Wasn't you, wasn't it you who were...
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.160]   Oh, the TMS.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.160]   Um, that was me.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.960]   Um, that wasn't the magnetic implant.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.960]   That was another thing with your brain and magnets.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960]   Yes.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.960]   Yes, it was another thing with my brain and magnets.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.440]   So people actually put magnets in their brains to give them six cents?
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.440]   No, the magnet goes in your finger.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440]   And does it help?
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.440]   And when you say people...
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.440]   Who?
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.440]   You?
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.440]   Yes.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.440]   Do you have six cents?
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.440]   I not anymore.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.440]   Do you took the magnet out?
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.440]   Yes.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.440]   Did it help?
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.440]   Did it work?
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.440]   So it did work.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.440]   What?
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.440]   Uh, it did work.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.040]   It's a sense for things like spinning motors and live cords.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040]   Oh, okay.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.040]   Something magnetic.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.040]   Yes.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.040]   So it makes sense.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.040]   So it makes sense.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.040]   It makes you magnetic.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.040]   It makes you able to sense the magnetic field.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.040]   Even very...
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.040]   The part you...
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.040]   The part you took is you can also pick up magnets.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.520]   So you can feel the pressure on your finger.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.240]   It's not really a pressure.
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.240]   It's a kind of a...
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.240]   It's actually a very, very profound oscillation.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.240]   I didn't know people did this.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.680]   There's no skin in the way.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:35.040]   Well, I usually recommend that people don't do it because the magnet failed.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.800]   It's a bionutral sheath.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.560]   That sheath breached my body attack magnet when it was...
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:43.400]   But when it was removed, it was removed by a hand surgeon so that I couldn't get an
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.400]   MRI.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.400]   Ever.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:49.280]   Well, see, there was a fast way to get it out in a slow way.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.760]   And I went for the slow way.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:58.400]   So although I did point out that no one was ever going to sneak up on me with an MRI machine.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:02.360]   That's a problem I'm doing by constantly.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.800]   And I had a sense for that sort of thing.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800]   Wow.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800]   It's coming.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:07.800]   Yes.
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:08.800]   So what other...
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:09.800]   I want a sense for found oscillation.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.800]   That sounds cool.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   But yeah.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.240]   But I kind of started out looking there.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:19.440]   But in the end, I found that the most profound from a society point of view, modifications
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.400]   tended to be things like vaccination and birth control.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.400]   Oh, well that makes sense, yeah.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:28.720]   And really, we live in a world that birth control had a great deal of effect on.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:32.880]   And then looking back further, I was kind of inquiring about how the new generation
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.320]   of drugs might affect society.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.040]   And the best model I could find for it was the introduction of coffee in Europe.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.600]   And it had tremendous effects.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:44.840]   And coffee half of the culture in Europe and was tied to the story of the Enlightenment.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:45.840]   And...
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.840]   Very interesting.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840]   That's very interesting.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.840]   It was a very exciting body.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.920]   I guess that is my body, any kind of stimulant or anything like that.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.760]   Certainly anything that you take to change the function of your body and the way you
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.760]   see yourself.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.640]   Your journalist, who do you write for?
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.640]   I'm a freelancer.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.160]   I've written a great deal for Wired.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:08.280]   I most recently wrote a piece in The Atlantic on a virtualized biotech company.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.280]   Oh, neat.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.760]   I love it.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:17.960]   Berrickin, which is bringing a drug to market for under $30 million with six employees.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:18.960]   Wow.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.960]   Generally considered to be impossible.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.960]   Yes.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.560]   But the guy who's doing it is doing it.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.560]   And it's working.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:33.880]   And he's doing it by creating a network of vendors and freelancers and smaller companies
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.400]   that he uses to outsource each part of the drug development process.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.440]   Quinn, you're also as a photographer but didn't have a camera with you.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.320]   I was impressed that you were willing to kind of not do that.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.000]   I try to demeitiate my food experience as much as possible.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.920]   I think I tweeted like twice.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.520]   That's more than I tweet?
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520]   Yes.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.520]   I did not.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.760]   I tweeted once to tell Baratunde to switch a session time though.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.760]   Yes.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.760]   And he tweeted that he was switching a session down.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   That was a little interesting.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.360]   And you made it worthwhile because you brought absence.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.360]   I did.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.080]   You brought combustible lemons.
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.080]   From the aperture science.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.080]   Yes.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.080]   Well.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.080]   Very exciting.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.080]   But where was the potato?
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.080]   I can't believe I missed this.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.840]   Ah, that's the problem with food camp.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.480]   Oh, there are so many things going on.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.480]   Just sing out.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:23.160]   And you write every month for maximum PC.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.160]   I do.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:27.040]   Do I write on intellectual property law and digital rights?
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.920]   What was just what was the highlight of food camp?
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.360]   Actually, we should do that and then we'll wrap up.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.920]   I could describe a little bit of werewolf too if we have time.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.880]   But what was the highlight of food camp for you this year?
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:43.560]   Actually, the thing, my big takeaway from food camp is that there's so many fascinating
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.920]   things that are waiting for better batteries.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.480]   Oh, God, is that true?
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.200]   There's so many mobile applications.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:55.000]   There's even, I, there's even some fascinating kind of cyborgian stuff I saw there.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.280]   But everything's just halted right now waiting for better batteries.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.720]   None of it can get through a day.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.440]   And really, if you are implanting something, you kind of needed to get through longer than
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.440]   a day.
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.760]   Longer than a day would be nice.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:10.960]   I think we have to work on having ATP power devices.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.080]   Because those power fuel cells are one of the things people are looking into.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:18.440]   Yeah, because that's the powerhouse of the blood of the of the biocys.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.040]   Have you seen the robots that eat meat?
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:24.440]   Because talking to the mic, if you just leave the robots that eat meat.
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.840]   The robots that eat meat.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:30.800]   But these recently built clocks and tables that are carnivorous.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.440]   Okay, that's weird.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.440]   It's not good, Dan.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.520]   I don't know why you would celebrate such a thing.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.880]   No, I'm not celebrating.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:37.880]   It's it's peculiar.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.720]   But no, these are actual machines that run off of biomass.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.760]   So they actually get energy from the meat?
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.320]   So in one case, they just eat it and spit it out.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:51.520]   It's a clock and flies are attracted to it.
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:52.520]   Oh, I would like that.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.520]   They stick to it.
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.520]   It's a Venus fly clock.
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.520]   Exactly.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:00.560]   They're all going to a fuel cell where they are digested, which powers the clock.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.560]   I want that.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.680]   I want it badly.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.120]   The problem is children fall into it too.
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.120]   It's the only negative.
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.400]   You have to put it up higher on the clock.
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.560]   It's a really long time.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.640]   It just takes one.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:16.160]   Dan, what was the highlight for you?
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.760]   So there was there was a couple of things that just kind of clicked together for me and
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.280]   in sort of one like beautiful, uh huh.
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.000]   We talked about privacy earlier.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.880]   We talked about big data and I suddenly had this, this sort of like, oh, I see the problem,
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:35.720]   which is right now our lives are becoming more public and the government is still very
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:36.720]   private.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.040]   And in fact, we want it to go the other direction.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.360]   We really the government to be public.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.360]   Yes.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.640]   The whole big data thing, the whole privacy thing, these are aspects of the same thing,
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:49.960]   which is we want the curve to go, we control our data, but we have access to the workings
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.920]   of our government and our companies.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.280]   And in fact, right now, it's the other way.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:59.200]   And so there's many different ways, aspects and directions, there's a movement to go reverse
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:04.160]   that trend and push it so that we know the people who are running our lives and they
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.160]   don't know about ours.
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:09.000]   In fact, that was one of the things that that privacy session that we went to, that
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.760]   somebody said that was quite true, is that we don't maybe mind if businesses have our
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.760]   information.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.560]   What we really don't want is the government to know that information.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.480]   And they said, what did they say?
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.480]   What was the line?
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:21.000]   Why the government shouldn't have our information?
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000]   Oh, right.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   Because they have a monopoly on violence.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000]   Kevin Marks, I appreciate your coming.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.840]   It's kind of the end of the show, but what was your highlight for Fukim?
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.400]   There were a couple.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:38.640]   But one was a very interesting session that Kathy Sierra put together on gamification
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.120]   and white's evil.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.640]   Wow, that's interesting.
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:45.720]   Because last year, Jane McGonagall was all about gamification of everything, right?
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:46.720]   Yes.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:51.080]   And but the problem is it's now been through, you know, passed on from hand to hand and
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.280]   lost all the all the Janeness from it.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:58.680]   And what we have instead is people just adding leaderboards and badges and nonsense and basically
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:03.080]   doing little skinner boxes instead of, instead of actual games.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:07.640]   Has anybody played Farmville as anybody who's been addicted to Farmville as I have for we
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.640]   rule?
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.640]   I agree.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:16.400]   Gamification is an evil and Zynga is evil because they suck you in, don't they?
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.400]   Right.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.080]   But it's also become this is suddenly it's the trend for marketers to do.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.720]   So every every site is getting badges and you know, you get a badge for going to our website
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.800]   and suddenly it's all in turning into nonsense.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:32.440]   So that she had a very good arguments that and the thing that she was particularly worried
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:38.160]   about was people talking about gamification for education and doing this because it because
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:45.160]   it has this initial increase in right affect and then it drops off to lower than before.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.160]   Oh, is that true?
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:52.560]   This is the actual research if you start giving people extrinsic rewards for doing things that
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:57.160]   are actually challenging, you know, not trivial.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.160]   Right.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.840]   Then the reaction is that they value the task itself less and do less of it.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:07.240]   And to some extent, you know, education already has that problem with GPA chasing.
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.240]   Right.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:13.120]   Last year Jane did a session on using games for education on teaching people to look left
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.360]   before they cross the street.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:18.520]   And she actually launched a company based on a five minute talk that she did at food camp
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.520]   last year.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:23.920]   I don't know if you saw this, but now public and hiring based on an experience she had
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.080]   with recovering from my beloved traumatic brain injury.
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:27.080]   That's right.
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.080]   Create a game around it.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.080]   I think you were there.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.080]   That's right.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.080]   And that's now a conversation game.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.080]   Really concussion game.
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.080]   And it helps her quite a bit.
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.080]   So there is some learning process.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.720]   The thing is yes, there is some value here and if you are actually a game designer, you
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.200]   can use those processes.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:48.160]   Now people are like making sort of cargo cult versions of this where they take the problem.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.160]   They don't get it.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.160]   They don't get it.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.160]   Right.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:56.320]   And actually end up polluting the sites and making things that aren't games either.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.320]   Right.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:05.160]   There's some wonderful studies in child psychology of, I'm remembering this.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.880]   So I might not have all the details perfect, but they took a group of children and they
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.520]   gave them crayons to color with.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:17.160]   And then they paid one part portion of the children like a dollar for their drawings
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:19.920]   and then brought them all in the next day and gave them crayons to color with.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:23.320]   And the ones that had been having a great time yesterday coloring colored again and
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.640]   the ones that had gotten paid wouldn't do it again until they found out if they were
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:27.640]   going to get away.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:28.640]   Oh, that's sad.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   And now they weren't having any fun.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:32.640]   Well, guess what?
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:34.600]   Welcome to the world, kid.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.800]   It's called work.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.800]   We all do it.
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.440]   We all hate it.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.440]   So take that.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.440]   I read about that.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.440]   That's very funny.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:47.200]   External motivators versus internal motivators and how external motivators can really ruin
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.200]   things in a way.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:53.680]   There was some great research in Israeli daycare along the same lines that when they said,
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.480]   please come and pick up your kids on time.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.120]   People failed to do so at some rate.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:01.600]   And then when they said, we're going to charge you $10, the rate went way up.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.600]   Right.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.600]   It's worth $10.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.760]   Oh, if it's going to cost me, I'm going to do it.
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.760]   How about you, Gene?
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:11.080]   I think it sticks to your memory from the last three days.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.080]   My brain is still processing.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:17.240]   But I think my overall takeaway is that we as geeks have sort of the power, a lot more
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.640]   power than we think that we have.
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:21.800]   And they're the tools that we create, create culture and influences culture.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.680]   And then it's important to sort of imbue our ideas and our values into the tools that
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:26.680]   we create.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:27.680]   Right.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:31.640]   And that we just can't sort of make things and be like, oh, let's just see what happens.
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:36.280]   I think that we have to kind of use our power for good and be more aware of our power.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.280]   So that's very true.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:41.920]   And I feel just very, very privileged to be alive at this time and to have the kind of
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:45.560]   access that we got at food camp and have access to folks like all of you.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.720]   I'm thrilled to be here.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:48.720]   Thank you.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:51.360]   So there was one other session where we were talking about the problem with the Protect
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.080]   IP Act and what we can do about that.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.040]   Oh, let's talk about that, Kevin, because I wasn't at that session, but you talked to
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:57.040]   me about this morning.
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.400]   So that's very important.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.800]   This is a call to action for everybody who watches this show.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.800]   Yes.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:06.240]   Well, the problem is we haven't got a concrete call to action yet, but there is an act
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:08.600]   being put through Congress who would protect IP.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.840]   You know, some more at this too, right?
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:11.840]   Yes.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:17.760]   Actually, I've been working with them, watching a little bit the demand progress campaign
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:23.800]   to try and stop Protect IP, which is the new name or the other name for Koika.
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:24.800]   It's interesting.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:28.720]   Like one of these things gets out, it's given a name and then it gets a bunch of bad press
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.400]   and they like change the name and then continue to try and do the same.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:37.440]   Protect IP, Koika, it's all an internet blacklist.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.760]   For me, one of the most chilling things about this is that this is in the backdrop of these
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:51.000]   raids that have been done by ICE and DHS alleging contributory criminal copyright infringement,
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.360]   which is not a law.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.080]   They're already doing these seizures based on something that not only isn't a law, but
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:01.600]   was rejected by Congress a few years ago.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.840]   And they announced last year they announced those raids from the Disney headquarters.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.720]   Yeah, and that's just kind of cheeky, I think.
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:10.880]   So now we know who's running the show, right?
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:16.560]   So Koika and Protect IP would expand those powers.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:22.840]   They legitimize what's already going on and they'd allow more domain seizures and they
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:30.480]   allow the government to create a list of websites that you couldn't access in the US.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:36.800]   And every ISP would be compelled to go get that list and block your access to those things.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:41.400]   And there's no profound judicial review on what goes on to that list.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:47.040]   So basically it's to protect big content companies and they get to say, we don't like
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.040]   these guys.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.040]   Take them out.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:56.040]   And then ICE or other federal agencies, the DHS will take them out and we won't be able
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.040]   to get to.
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.680]   And it's really unclear where the edges are, those, those things are.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:02.000]   And I think it really runs into a lot of first amendment problems.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.800]   Yeah, it's clearly contrary to the internet.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:09.480]   So the question is how can we, as Geeks will understand this, make lawmakers understand
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.480]   it.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.640]   Kevin Marks, you have some experience with this.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.440]   Well, it is a challenge.
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:20.040]   I mean, the problem is that the lawmakers, it's very easy for the Hollywood side to tell
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.640]   their story because that's their job, their professional story tellers.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:26.640]   They're good at creating narratives and getting glamorous people to present them well.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:28.800]   Whereas from our side, that's not what we do most of us.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.440]   We're sitting here just building things.
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.320]   And it's very hard to make common and carriage sexy.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:38.960]   That is, this isn't a sort on the principle of common carriage, which is a very old principle
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:43.200]   of common law that says, if I'm transporting something for you, I'm not responsible for
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:45.000]   the contents of it.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.840]   So this is, this is, this is why we're able to build many of these websites that host
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:53.320]   staff because the liability is, is not passed on to the host.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.360]   It's the person who put it up there who's liable.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.880]   And there's another piece called Safe Harbor, which was part of the Copyright Act, which
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.960]   is why, I mean, one of the reasons the US was able to build some of these sites and
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.200]   it was trickier in other countries.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.600]   Without which you could have no YouTube.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.600]   Right.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:10.560]   Without this, could have YouTube, you couldn't have photograph hosting and things like that.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.120]   And this isn't a sort on that principle.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.360]   This is saying, okay, we, we are going to hold you liable for this and we're going to take
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.720]   your entire business away because you're hosting somebody on your site, updated something
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.480]   we don't like.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.720]   And that, that is, you know, that, that's scary.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.360]   We need to fight, fight back against that.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.000]   So if you've got some direct.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:36.080]   Well, right now, like I said, most of this work, footwork is being done by demandprogress.org.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:40.920]   But there's always like the most direct option, which is calling your representative, calling,
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:46.480]   emailing, writing paper letters to your Congress critter and your, you know, your senators
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.480]   and so on and so forth.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:51.960]   And those things, especially if you take the time to do them, not just sign a petition,
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.840]   those things, those numbers do build up and they do listen to that.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:57.040]   It's not the only thing they listen to, but it does make a difference.
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:01.680]   You know, I actually spent a summer back in high school as an intern in Congress or in
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.280]   college, I think it was.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:06.480]   And it's funny, we were talking earlier about Apple reversing their subscription stance.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480]   Right.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:11.720]   And the one way Congress is like Apple is they do listen if enough people squawk.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:16.040]   And so it's very true that if you call your local representative, call your local senator,
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:19.320]   the one who represents you or write paper mail again, even since paper.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.760]   Even if it's time to do paper.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:25.680]   The phone calls are given a reasonable percentage emails kind of lowest on the totem pole.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680]   Right.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.360]   But make the call takes a minute.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:31.880]   Somebody answered the phone, there'll be a staffer you say, my name is so and so, I live
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:33.320]   in so and so, that's important.
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:37.640]   So they know you're a constituent and I wanted to let the Congress member know XYZ.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.040]   That's your assignment.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:43.520]   Everybody is listening to call your member of Congress and, and or write to them and
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.560]   say, you've got to oppose the protect IP.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.960]   Say, tell them you're upset.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:48.960]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:49.960]   Say this is wrong.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:55.160]   And you know, Kevin, Kevin had a great little bit of great strategy with this, which is
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:59.200]   that every constituency has a reason not to like it.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:04.120]   If you're a libertarian on the right, obviously government intervention is a bad idea.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:11.720]   If you're a, if you're, if you're a Christian coalition, you wouldn't like it because it
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.400]   fact would impact churches as much as anybody else.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:17.200]   So it's an free, any free speech.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.840]   It's an anti free speech move.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:23.400]   And that's one of those things that you should be, you should be able to build a broad coalition
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.400]   for that.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:25.400]   The double ARP.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:30.200]   The double ARP, I'm sure wants to continue to use the fast and fast.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.720]   See your, see your grandkids pictures.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:37.800]   There's older people joining the net in connection with the, you know, and seeing photo hosting
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:38.800]   and things like that.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:43.400]   And you wouldn't be able to have a public photo hosting site on the threat of this.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:44.400]   Flickr doesn't exist.
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.400]   Or photo bucket.
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:49.320]   Or photo bucket, which you know a little bit about Dan Shapiro.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.320]   It's my heart.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:53.800]   Since that's one of the, it wasn't a Flickr project originally.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:59.120]   No, Photo Bucket was an independent company bought by Fox and then my previous company
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.200]   on tell us, fun Photo Bucket out and merge.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.200]   So I'm on the board.
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.200]   Awesome.

[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.520]   Okay.
