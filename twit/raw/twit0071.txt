[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.200]   This weekend tech is brought to you by Dell.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   Check out Leo's Fix online at twit.tv/dell.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.200]   And by Showtime, Showtime presents Dexter, a killer new series.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.200]   The premiere's Sunday, October 1 at 10/9c with replays all week.

[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   Doug Kay is here from IT Conversations.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   He's going to hand his tiara off to me a little later on.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.200]   Absolutely.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.200]   Last year's podcast person of the year.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.200]   And if you should fail to succeed in your duties,
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200]   you'll be running around.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   Okay, thank you.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   Actually, Doug has some big announcements.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   We'll get to that in just a second.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   Also with me, Steve Gibson, another Twit from securitynow@grc.com.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   Setting next to Steve Gibson, the great Scott Bourne from Mac Break Weekly
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   and the I Life Zone.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   He's also a great aperture expert, aperturetricks.com and podcastingtricks.com.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200]   And what we're going to do today, before you give it off,
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   keep the microphone, what we're going to do today is talk to a lot of podcasters.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   As many as we can in half an hour before they take the stage away from us.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   Podcast Expo is the gathering of the tribes for podcasting.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   The second year, we've done it about 2,500 people.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   We've taken over a small part of the Ontario Convention Center.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   A lot of booths showing podcast software, podcast hardware.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   Broadcasters general stories here and thanks to them, we've got audio on this podcast.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   Which is really handy for a podcast.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   It certainly makes a difference.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   They lend us their illicit multi-mix 8 firewire.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   What would you say, Doug K?
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   You've been podcasting longer than anybody on this panel,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   longer than anybody except Christopher Leiden.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   That's right.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   What would you say is different this year about podcasting from years past?
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   I think last year it was still new to everybody.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   I think those of us who have been in it.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   I think what I'm seeing today is people who are podcasters and have been podcasters
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   and can be considered veteran podcasters this point.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   A whole year!
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   I think that's it.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   Some of us are here for the second time.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   Wow.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   I think at least for our little club of 2500 people, we are mainstream.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   It does feel like a club though because you see the same faces.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   In fact, one of the things that kind of surprises me about this is a lot of people here
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   promoting their podcast to other podcasters.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   Really, what we need to do is promote it to people who don't know about podcasting.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   It's great and you want to get the word out, but these are the last people that you'd probably
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   say, "Hey, I have a podcast to."
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   Scott Borne, you also a long time audio guy.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   In fact, you come from, as I do and I think Doug too, from Real Radio, Scott was...
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   He's got that voice.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   He does.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   That radio voice.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   Do the thing you were doing, he's Scott Allen, or Alan Scott.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   Alan Scott.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   Alan Scott, he was a DJ.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   Go ahead.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   Let's just hear a little bit of the Al Scott.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   Okay, we're going to go back in time to the days of AOR Radio.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   This is the Al Scott show.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   We've got a brand new one coming at you on WFP stereo 93.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   It's the Deep Purple.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   Anybody from Indianapolis recognize that?
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   Yeah, a couple of fans there, including Elvis Paltry.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   You're from India.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   That would be your only excuse for dressing in a chicken suit and singing Elvis.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   I got to tell you, I never met anybody in a chicken suit in Indianapolis.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Well, you just have to go back, apparently.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   It's very big now.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Things have changed since the days of Radio Radio.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   You were doing streaming radio before anybody.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   Yeah, in 1994 we launched a company called Net Radio.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   We used Real Audio 1.0.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   We delivered music to folks on 1200 BOD modems, and it sounded like your aunt, Ed, Ed, and
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   a chicken in a toilet.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   But we had an IPO and made a lot of money and got away with it.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   But, you know, we wanted to do what's going on now.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   We didn't have the bandwidth.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   We didn't have anything like RSS.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   We did deliver information on demand through a company called Pointcast.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   As you and I discussed last time.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   You did Pointcast?
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   We did Pointcast.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   We took Net Radio attached it to Pointcast.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   Technically.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   That was the first podcast, if your criteria is audio delivered on demand, and that was done in 1994.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   And if you don't use the word POD.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   Well, that's one of the issues.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   I certainly raised that in my keynote.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   And if you go to the Twitch site, you see, I don't say the word POD anymore.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   I say, "Netcast" you love from people you trust.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   And that says, "Netcast" everywhere.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   Am I crazy?
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   Is this a quick-sotic attempt?
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   You know, Scott and I are kind of thinking, you know, Scott and I have actually talked about
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   maybe we should trademark this, maybe we should pursue this, maybe we should get an industry
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   group to own it, to protect it.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   Well, you want to prevent anybody else from grabbing it and using it, and then, you know, doing an end run.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   Russell is here, we'll talk to him in just a little bit from a podcast ready.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   They're one of the sponsors of it, but they're also of the show, but they're also one of the people Apple,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   they're the people that Apple sent that famous cease and desist letter to.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   Now, did you get one?
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   Ray Slakinski is actually, and the guy created iPod or X.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   Right.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   Which was the first really good podcast client, which got put out of business by iTunes pretty much.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   Pretty much.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   Phenomically, but then they went after you the name too, right?
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   Right.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   Well, we got a cease and desist order, well, almost a year ago, and what they did within the letters,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   we had an iPod pretty much on the logo, it was changed a little bit to look like a transistor radio.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   They forced us to remove that, the iPod as part of the name had to be removed, but also we couldn't just
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   drop the eye and make it potter X.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   We had to remove pod from the name.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   So, this is nothing new to me.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   This is something well over a year ago.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   Now, people say to me, well, they're not going to go after podcasters.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.200]   In fact, Apple and its letter to podcast ready said, we're not going to go after podcasters,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   and yet I was talking to Russell from podcast ready yesterday, and he said, well, in fact,
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   they do go after podcasters.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   There was a podcast called Pod Golf Fit.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   Podcast only.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   They weren't selling services, they weren't selling hardware.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   Not the letter from Apple said you got to drop the name.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   Here's what I think happened with podcast ready.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   Podcast ready, my understanding is they filed a trademark application.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   Now, when you do that, you're attracting attention and you're forcing Apple's hand.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   They must defend their trademark.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   So, you're really not giving them much choice in that case.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   Well, but what the issue is are they trying to trademark pod, and they apparently are.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   The word pod itself.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   Well, I think you simply in a situation that they are forced in order to maintain any trademark,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   they must continue to pursue it.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   Well, what I think is what they're doing is using this Eastern Decision going after something
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   like my podter or ipodter that sounds like ipod, but in the same letter, also trying to
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   get you to remove pod.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200]   Right.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   I'm not sure if they have much legal ground to actually get you to remove pod, but they
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   have it to remove my pod and ipod from the name.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   The point is, they have to ask.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   Right.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   They have to put that in the demand letter.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   And nobody has caved except for you, right?
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   No, no, no, no.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   A lot of people have caved.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   Not the only ones.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   A few of caved.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   iPodter, which is now called juice.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   Lemon.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   It used to be ipodter lemon, now called juice.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   Got the same letter.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   So, let me ask the podcasters here.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.200]   Should we find a new name or do we stick with podcast?
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   Stick with podcast.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   No, raise your hands.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   It's audio.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   You have to teach these people.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   Say, should we stick with podcast?
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   Yes!
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   Should we change to something else?
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   Yes!
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   Should we use netcast?
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   No!
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   I can't win.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   I think it's going to be a podcast.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   I think it's a podcast.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   I doubt that in the least.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   And as I said, I'm not trying.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   My changing unilaterally, I know nobody's going to...
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   I'm like Audie Murphy, charging over hamburger hill saying, "Come on guys!"
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   And nobody's following you.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   No, no one's following you.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   Well, you started off by asking, "Am I crazy?"
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   I guess you are.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   Yes, yes.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   But I just feel like it doesn't serve us.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   That's certainly one of the things we're talking about here.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   Another thing that everybody's talking about is monetizing podcasts.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   We are, as you say, a mature industry now.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   People are taking ads.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   They're looking at ways of monetizing.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   That's certainly one of the things.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   And there's a lot of new services.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   Now, you've got one Doug K. GigaVox, which is the company that you've formed.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   It's got the umbrella company around IT conversations.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   You haven't asked something really cool.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   A lot of podcasts are going to be interested in level later.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   That's right.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   Why don't we go live with this show?
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   You're looking at me now?
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   Yeah, when is this show launched?
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   I'm going to get it out as soon as I can.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   Okay.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   Probably Saturday.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   Starting sometime, hopefully Saturday morning at GigaVox.com.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   By the time you hear this.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   By the time you hear this, otherwise I'm in deep trouble, at GigaVox.com you will be able to download for free a copy of the level later.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   Level later.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   The level later I guarantee will make all your podcasts sound better.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   And it's free and I guarantee that on a double your money back guarantee.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   If you don't like it, I'll give you back double what you paid for.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   But what it does is it goes in to your show and it levels out all the long-term variations such as,
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   as we're talking here and we have different people at different levels because of the mixing situation.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   It'll smooth all that out.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   If you've ever done an interview with uneven speaker levels, if you've done a phone interview, it'll solve all those things.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   We've had this problem in our production department for many years.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   We've had some internal tools. We've finally decided to publish those tools and make them available to all podcasters.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   Level later.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   It definitely leads them.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   I'm going to tell you that I know that your level later will be out before this podcast is out because I'm going to use it on this podcast.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   All right.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   Now, it is my initial reaction.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   I looked at it. I said, "Oh, it's compression. It's not compression."
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   No.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   Leveling is very, I'm sorry, limiting is very short-term.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.200]   You know, get the spikes out with a limiter.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   Compression is moderately short-term. It acts within a few seconds.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   The level later works over periods of many seconds.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.200]   What we're doing in there, we're going in and making a loudness map of the entire wave or AIFF file
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   and deciding where the changes are and then going back in and doing individual RMS normalization for each second.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   That's what I was going to say. Smart normalization.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   Smart normalization.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   I think that's something we need.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   And we can do it because we can do look ahead and we can build that map.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   We can do things that you cannot do in a hardware because we have infinite look ahead.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   You're also going to offer a service that you're using right now to build IT conversations.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   That's coming a few months from now.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   Yeah, we have a new, our real business is the content management system
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   that will be available for all serious and large podcasters.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   You know, anybody who has a little bit of a budget to pay for it.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   And that is a company.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   Why are you looking at me?
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   Yeah, really.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   Don't look at that.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   And this is a perfect example of a change that's happened between this year and last year.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   Now we're talking about perfecting the podcasts that we're making.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   I remember last year people were saying, how do I do one?
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   Right.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   We haven't been a very good example of the answer to that question here.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   People at home don't know as it took us about four hours.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   Those questions have been answered.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   People are able to make the podcast now.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   And so now they want them levelized.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   Right.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   So this is the new gig of Vox, a services business.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   Yeah, we've always been a technology company but because we've had some strong content IT conversations,
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   people thought of us as a content company.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   So giving out the level later, and I see the author of it, Bruce just sat down there,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   we're giving it out there to try and get the message across that we really are a,
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   if I may say so, one of the premier podcast technology companies.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   You may say so.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   Thank you.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   Say that.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   I just said that.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   Also here, I notice it's not podcurrent.com.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   Ray Slickinski's a little gunshot.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   He's calling it popcurrent.com.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   Tell us about that.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   Popcurrent is a site to solve actually the problem of promotion of your podcast.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   Like Hallelujah.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   What you were talking about before is that podcasters are currently promoting to other
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   podcasters or at least some people that know about podcasts.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   So the iTunes podcast directory, you already have to know sort of what a podcast is in
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   order to start checking those out.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   So we're trying to reach out to the rest of the world.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   And by doing so, we have a site very much like Dig.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   Use the same model where you either pop or flop a particular episode.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   So podcasters can submit an episode up to the site and people rate it and it goes up
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   to the best page or to the hot nail page if it's new and popular.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   And people can see it that way.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   But the interesting thing is that we don't say it's just podcast.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   We have categories like talk and video and books even.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   So we have some cross-pollination between people from MySpace, people from YouTube that are coming
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   to the site that have no clue what a podcast is but are coming for a band.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.200]   But see their podcast just below that entry and they click it, like it and then possibly
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   subscribe to it.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   And now they know what a podcast is.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   So we're trying to reach out to that other group.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   There's a lot of people here I think who are recognizing that's the next step for
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   podcasting.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   We've got to get people to see it, to find it, to know it exists.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   New markets.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   New markets.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   We've got kind of, I think we're plateauing a little bit frankly.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   I think that we're hitting that where 300, 500,000 of the doctors have already adopted.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   So what we're trying to reach out to is all those people that are on MySpace that are
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   using the system to find bands but now we're kind of bringing that out from MySpace and
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   getting people over into podcasts.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   See the YouTube video.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   That's a great idea.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   Well we'll be on it.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   I know most of you guys will want to be on it too.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   I think that's really important.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   Thank you Ray.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   Thank you.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   And thanks for Ipotter X which was equally important.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   Now just one quick thing about Ipotter X.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   I've been promised by August we will release something transistor.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   It will come out soon.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   I hope by the end of the year.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   Good.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   Just to satisfy all the fans that still use the software.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   It's a great program.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   You've made some great strides in supporting new file types, OPML type subscriptions so
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   you can subscribe to the Leo channel that has all the feeds.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   It's got some great features that iTunes can ever match.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   Well that's another issue I raised is that we are so iTunes dependent that isn't a long
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   run non healthy.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.200]   We are going to release it with just you know software bugs.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   We're like Microsoft and Vista.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   Eventually we will come out with the software baggage that you might want to use.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   Nobody's like Microsoft Vista.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   Thank you Ray Slick.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   You're welcome.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   Hey Han, they're microphone over to this other guy because here's a face I haven't seen in
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   so long.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   Martin Sargent.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   Oh my gosh.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   It's so great to see you.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   His podcast is infected and that's actually the name not the problem.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   It's maybe poo cast would be a better name for that.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   And you're part of the new revision three.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   Yeah I am part of revision three.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   Infected as part of revision three so is a new show that I got up there called WebDrifter.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   Martin Sargent WebDrifter which is actually a pilot that was commissioned by Comedy Central.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.200]   Oh.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.200]   Which got turned down.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   Thank you.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   Who needs Comedy Central?
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   Who needs it?
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.400]   Because we got revision three now so you guys can all go up there right now and watch the
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.200]   first episode of WebDrifter.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   What's that about?
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.400]   WebDrifter is the premise is I've been meeting Martin Sargent, I've been surfing the internet
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.200]   doing nothing else since the Clinton administration and I finally finished it.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   And I don't know what to do with my life anymore so now I'm going to retrace my steps.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   This time I'm going to do it for real.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   I'm going to go to the physical locus of every website and go behind the website.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   That's a great idea.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   So in the first episode we go to AlexChoo.com behind that.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   He's the guy who invented the immortality rings of course.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   Right.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   Which is a secret to Martin.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   Yeah, look at me.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   I've not aged one day since the Clinton administration.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Seriously.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   Look at this.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   I feel so youthful.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   Compared to my messy white man.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   Oh, you.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   I thought this was supposed to be new media.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   You know what?
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   It's more like ARP.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   We are the old guys, aren't we?
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   That's fine.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   I don't mind.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   It's great to see you, Marty.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   Marty came here last week and turned out there wasn't an expo here so he's decided to
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   come back.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   But the park is free.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   I'm an early adopter.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   What can I say?
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   A little tour.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   I've never left.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   I've been living in the parking lot for a whole week waiting for this thing to start.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   Marty, it's so great to see you.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   Things are going well.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   Things are going real well.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   Things are going great.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   I'm very excited about this new medium as I'm sure everyone here is.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   It's just great having tried to work in the Hollywood machine for a while now and doing
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   okay.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.960]   I'm making it a little bit but to be able to sit at my kitchen table with my friends with
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.040]   less than $300 worth of equipment and still reach a huge audience.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.040]   That's the future, man.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.040]   Isn't that great to be here with you guys?
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   So thank you very much for the opportunity.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.040]   Martin, sorry.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.040]   Check out WebDripster and in fact it on Revision3.com.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.560]   Hey Russell, come up here Russell for a second.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.440]   I want to talk to Russell in just a second.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.720]   But I do want to mention while Comedy Central sucks, Showtime isn't so bad.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.840]   This podcast is brought to you by Showtime.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.840]   You're excited about Dexter, aren't you?
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   Oh, Dexter, yes.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.840]   It really looks good.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.840]   Have you seen the ads for this?
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.840]   Actually, I have.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.240]   And you know what I really liked was the fact that they had the ladies from the L-word
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.760]   saying that if I would be interested in a guy, it would be Dexter.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:49.560]   He's a psychopathic dysfunctional serial killer who happens to work for Miami Homicide.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.560]   He's a forensic investigator.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   I thought he used to work for Tech2D.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.760]   He's a serial killer and he only kills bad guys.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.240]   He kills other bad guys.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.280]   Yeah, the guy who's a black comedy.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280]   Yeah, I think.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.280]   But you know what I like?
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   It's the guy from a Six Feet Under.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.080]   Yeah, the guy who played David, I love him.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.080]   I love him.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:10.200]   So the premiere is Sunday, October 1st at 10 PM, 9 Central replays all week or watch it
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.000]   on demand at any time to subscribe, call 1-800-SHOTIME or go to SHO.com.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.240]   We thank Showtime for the support of this podcast.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.200]   Now, let's say hi to the folks from Podcast Ready.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.240]   Russell, and how do you say you're last time?
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.240]   Holloman.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.680]   Holloman is the guy who got the Apple letter.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.320]   Congratulations, Russell.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.320]   Well, thanks.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.160]   You're a cause celeb here.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.920]   I noticed that you still calling yourself Podcast Ready, that you haven't taken the pod
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.920]   out of your name yet.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.320]   No, no, we haven't.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   What's your plan?
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.960]   Plan is just keep doing what we're doing.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.800]   You know, we've had a lot of success in the last couple of months.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.080]   You're a sponsor, the major sponsor of this podcast show.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.320]   We have a lot of Podcast Ready-enabled devices out there on store shelves right now, trying
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.000]   to introduce, you know, a whole new group of people to podcasting.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.160]   So what, so it's a hardware device?
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.080]   Well, no, it's a software package that we added to a hardware device.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.080]   I see.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:13.000]   And MP3 manufacturers are preloading it on their devices so that when, you know, a new
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.520]   device is sold, a new potential audience member for it.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.520]   And what do you get?
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.880]   You get, does it automatically download podcasts?
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.520]   What it does when you first connect your device, it contacts our server, it gets an initial
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.440]   subscription list of podcasts.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.640]   Do you tweet on that list?
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.640]   It will be.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.640]   Yeah, it will be.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.320]   That was the deal.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.480]   Anyway, no.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.480]   So it's just-
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   It wasn't the deal.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.480]   I want to say.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.480]   You absolutely do not have to.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.280]   In fact, you probably shouldn't because people who listen to it can figure out how to get
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.280]   it.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.520]   You should have mommy cast stuff that, you know, people who are not technically literate
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   what want.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.440]   Reality, it's actually a mix of half and half.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.520]   Half of it is mainstream and half of it is, you know, not.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.520]   Right.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   Are you able to change that actively?
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.920]   So it's a constant-
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.920]   Alex Lindsey is here, by the way, for the picks and for it.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.920]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.920]   Sorry.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.480]   So you can decide what that- is it just checking into the server and then getting whatever
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   the server tells it should be the-
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.760]   The list is actually dynamically built, you know, based on the device or the source.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.280]   Now one of the things we are going to do, you do have a software program.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.440]   It's written in Java, runs on Mac and Windows.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.280]   You've said it'll go on Linux soon.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.440]   They're putting it to Linux right now.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.040]   And so we've made it- one of the things we did last night when we were talking, I said,
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.560]   can I please have a customized Twit version I could put on the website?
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.560]   People can click a link.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.600]   Again, this is- I don't have anything against iTunes.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.240]   iTunes is the best thing that happened to podcasting, but also now in some ways the
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:43.080]   worst thing, because it's so dominant, I want people to come to my site and simply say,
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.520]   click this button, download this software, it'll automatically download all our podcasts,
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.920]   and you can listen on your computer or put it on MP3 Play.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.160]   So we are going to start doing that.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.160]   Right.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:56.360]   And the way it works is when that software gets activated, it will get your initial subscription.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.360]   Right.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360]   So later on, you can change it.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.240]   Change your feed, or you add a show.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.240]   That's cool.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.240]   Then the very next download.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   And it'll be free, right?
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240]   Absolutely free.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   Okay.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   So that's- I think that's neat.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.840]   And it is actually an issue for Linux users.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.520]   Is that not true that it's a- well, you're a Mac user too.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.560]   You know, Randall Schwartz is here.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.200]   He's a geek and a hacker and a podcaster.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.360]   He does the geek cruises news.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.120]   But you- but you- see, I think Linux is a little tough to get podcasts downloaded on.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.400]   So it'll be nice to have a Linux client.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.640]   So work on that, would you, Russell?
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   Absolutely.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.160]   I would do to help you in your fight against the evil empire.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.000]   Never thought I'd say that, did you?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Yeah, that's sacrilege.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.720]   You're going straight to Apple Hill.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.160]   Well, I mean, you know, what can you do?
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.160]   I don't know.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   You've got lawyers.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.080]   As far as- as far as that's concerned, I just think it's really important that people
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.320]   understand that it's not just because we filed for trademark in the device space.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.920]   It's anybody who's filed a trademark.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.960]   It's- it's- whether it's content or anything else.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.200]   We were talking to Denise Howell-
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   It's all about the pod.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:02.400]   Well, as the lawyer IP specialist who is the host of Tharnex podcast this week in law,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.240]   we were talking to her yesterday and you and she both agreed that what- in all likelihood,
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.200]   Apple has retained a law firm, just kind of independently to be sifting through all the
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.560]   filings and whenever one shows up, they press a button and out comes a letter and they send
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.560]   it to you.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   Probably so.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.560]   Because I've seen other letters.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.560]   They're all the same.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   They're pretty much the same.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.560]   They just change the category titles and that's great.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.060]   So, you know, we'll see how it goes.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.060]   Thank you very much, Russell.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.060]   We really appreciate it.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.800]   Scott, Warren, you know a lot about trademark law.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   Do you have any opinion on that?
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.680]   I do, but I- I- I want to jump in here real quick about one thing I think is remarkable.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   Now, if you look at the Twit podcast, if you look at the- all the tech podcasts that,
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.280]   you know, the top 25 or 30, like half of them are Twit podcast.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:50.580]   And yet, you're still a guy saying, even though I'm in all these podcast directories
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.520]   on top, I still think we got to get out of this.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.960]   I just think that's pretty remarkable because that shows that your message is not
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   because you're hurt.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.960]   It's because they're- No.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.100]   In fact, Apple, I ought to thank Apple.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.700]   We have a Twit artist page.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.700]   They've been very good.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.060]   Scott and Peter here somewhere.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.300]   I asked them to be on the podcast, but of course it's hard for them corporately to come
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.300]   on up.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.300]   They can't say anything.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.300]   They can't say anything.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.300]   But I have the deepest respect for them.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.300]   I think the iTunes people have been very good to us.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.300]   Very good.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.300]   All around.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   It isn't for me, I'm saying this.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.300]   You're exactly right.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   It's you.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   It's for everybody.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.300]   Because all the Twit podcasts are on the top of the directory.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.300]   So, it's a statement against interest.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.200]   It's not competing with all these people and that's the point is that we're all in this
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   together.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   So, I think Leo deserves a hand.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   Oh, please, now.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.480]   I think one of the things that we should be lobbying to do is get Microsoft to step up.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:40.980]   You know, obviously, and this may even be the intent by being active in this space, Apple
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:46.040]   has in effect said to Microsoft in any device maker that are not used the word pod.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.120]   And if you buy a Zoom, we played with a Zoom yesterday.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   Yes.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   And you know what?
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   It was pretty nice.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   It was pretty cool.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.120]   Yes, pretty cool.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.120]   But guess what?
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.120]   It doesn't say podcasts on.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.340]   They would be foolish to do that because you know Apple's lawyers would be on them right
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.340]   away.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.340]   If it was Brown, it wasn't Brown.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.340]   If only it wasn't Brown.
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.340]   You know what?
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.340]   I bet the Brown looks good.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.340]   But anyway, I just want to say that.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:09.580]   And so, I understand Apple's point of view, but we got to get Microsoft to put an aggregator
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.580]   into Vista.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.740]   Zoom's got to have great podcast support.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.740]   It doesn't yet.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.740]   The bottom line is one of the reasons we got into podcasting was so that we had a lot
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.500]   of ways to get to viewers or listeners and so on and so forth.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.700]   And the problem that we have now is it's suddenly gotten back to one outlet again.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:30.000]   And people perceive it as an iPod and that's great for those who have an iTunes and an
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.440]   iPod, but it's not so good if you don't.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:37.040]   And I think that I think Apple has to be almost overly careful about making sure that they
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.760]   really take care of making sure that smaller podcasts are really well positioned and pushed
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   because then you don't get this kind of backlash or as much of one.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.760]   There's much worry.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   Right.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   Let's talk to some more podcasters.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.760]   There's so many podcasters here.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.000]   And of course, as I'm walking around the show floor, everybody I see, I say, "Come on
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.700]   over and we only have about."
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.700]   I don't know.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.500]   They're going to throw us out soon.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.940]   Only a few more minutes, but let's say hi.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.300]   Yeah, I'll get you Robbie.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.300]   Calm down.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.300]   Calm down.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.740]   For Robbie, he's looking at me because the last year he didn't make it either.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.740]   He's been waiting a whole year to be on the podcast, but I want to talk about Neo fight.
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.740]   Ben is here.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.740]   Ben introduced your partner for Neo fight.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.580]   Yeah, Ben Friedman and Tiffany Young.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.580]   Hi Tiffany.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.580]   Hi, Tiffany.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.580]   Nice to meet you.
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.820]   So it's kind of, it's another tech podcast, but an interesting twist on the tech podcast.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.340]   It's a tech show for beginners and it's a debate show.
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.080]   I'm kind of the geek.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.280]   And you know, it's got LEDs and blinks.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   I like it generally.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.700]   Tiffany is more of the realist, so she'll tell you if it's actually worth money or not
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.020]   and every day, five days a week, we record a new show and it's a new gadget, whether
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.520]   it's an iPod or whether it's, oh, can I say that?
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.520]   Sorry.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.920]   Whether it's a media player or whether it's a, you know, a coffee maker or a new vacuum
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.780]   or anything, any new bit of technology, you know, we'll talk about it and see if something's
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.780]   worth the money.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.620]   I kind of like the consumer reports of the podcast.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.420]   Do we still use podcasts?
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.420]   You can use anywhere in the vidcast.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.420]   You can use the vidcast.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.420]   Internet TV.
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.980]   So what we try to do is we try to reach the general media that's not over the, over the
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.980]   top techy.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.860]   So we're able to talk about things such as vacuum, like Ben said, and I can say Ben,
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.140]   you know, he's like, oh, it's so cool.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.140]   It's got this world full suction.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.140]   And you've got the real world point of view.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.140]   And I'm like, are you kidding me?
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.620]   This is a joke that you're not making in the book.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.620]   And you know, it's all your fault, Leo, because six months ago I called your show and said,
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.620]   I love your podcasts.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.940]   You know, what should I do if I start one?
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.340]   And you said, start one right now.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.340]   You'll be rich in six months.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.340]   Oh, sorry.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.340]   Where's my money, Leo?
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.340]   Where's my money?
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.340]   That's what I want to know.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.780]   Don't forget to watch Dexter on Showtime, 10 o'clock.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.780]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.780]   Hey, good luck.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.780]   It's great to see you.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.780]   Thanks for coming by.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.780]   Appreciate it.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.780]   And come on up here.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.780]   We got Craig Severson.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.780]   Why don't you come up here?
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.780]   Robbie, you come on Robbie.
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.780]   Don't be shy.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.220]   Robbie is the youngest podcaster here.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.220]   Am I wrong?
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.220]   No, wait a minute.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.620]   I met a five year old podcaster earlier.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.060]   The podcast with this family, though.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.500]   Robbie, how old are you?
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.500]   14.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.140]   I'm from 15 in November.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.140]   How exciting.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.700]   And you're part of the Teen Podcast Network.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.700]   What's it called?
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.700]   TeenPodcasters.com.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.700]   TeenPodcasters.com.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.660]   How many of you are there?
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:10.540]   We started with 75 and we recently renewed membership and now, unfortunately, we're down
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.540]   to 30.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.540]   But they're all doing podcasts?
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.540]   Yes.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.540]   I think that's great.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.540]   That's very cool.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.540]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.540]   Really cool.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.740]   You see all the time teenagers are doing web pages.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.740]   Isn't that great?
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:27.540]   But it's really neat to see that also, media, rich media like video and audio, this is
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.540]   your natural tongue.
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.540]   You're completely comfortable with it, right?
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.420]   Now, the last time we talked to you, you were kind of taking time off from the podcast.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.420]   Have you gotten back?
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.180]   Yeah, I still am a little.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.700]   I'm trying to, I'm working my way into TPN, starting to do new projects, stuff like that.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.700]   That's neat.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.900]   So if you're a Teen Podcast or TeenPodcasters.net or com?
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:47.900]   Not.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.900]   Not.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.900]   Not net.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.900]   All right.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.900]   Hey, Robbie, I got you on.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.700]   Hand the mic over to the video, the video grunt.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.340]   Craig Severson is grunt media.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.340]   Yes, sir.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:03.860]   And you're doing, have you ever seen, isn't this the best video podcast ever?
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.020]   This guy is so great.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.020]   Really inventive.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.860]   I got to pay another 20 bucks if you keep doing it.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.860]   No, no, no.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.580]   But I bet, Twit doesn't know me, but I do look forward to watching some Showtime programming
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.580]   on my new Dell laptop.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:19.580]   That's a drill with my digitalcom.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.380]   You know, while we're mentioning that, you might want to visit Dell.com/Twit.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.940]   This is ridiculous.
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.420]   This is ridiculous.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.820]   I don't want to sell out that big.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.700]   We'll put a commercial in later.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.700]   How about that?
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.700]   My next show is going to be This Week in Grunt.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   Is it?
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.700]   Twit would be good.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.700]   Hey, why not?
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.700]   Twit, you do have a podcast grunt.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.540]   You're starting to do audio as well as video.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.540]   Yes.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.540]   And this teaches people how to do it, right?
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   Right.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:49.420]   And with Padra, my attempt was to explain what a podcast is to my mother-in-law.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.420]   And she got it.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.420]   So it works.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.620]   And I don't use any scary abbreviations in this explanation, but my whole point is to
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:59.300]   explain complex things very simply in video files that are less than five minutes long.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.300]   Excellent.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.300]   It's a beautiful podcast.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.300]   Thank you.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.300]   Highly recommended.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.220]   Hand the mic over speaking beautiful to my newest Twit, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:12.100]   I'd like to introduce Denise Howell, who is a very well-known legal blogger and the host
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.860]   of the new Twill, which is done.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.620]   But if Leo would just get off his duff and put it out, it would be out there.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.620]   Welcome, Denise.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.620]   It's nice to meet you.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.620]   Hi.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.620]   It's great to be here.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.620]   We're excited.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.620]   Tell us what Twill is going to be all about.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:31.180]   Twill, This Week in Law, is going to examine issues much like you often discuss on Twit,
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.580]   legal issues that relate to the technology world.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:39.820]   We're going to have a semi-irregular panel of folks who are going to join me, including
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:45.740]   Ernie Svensson, who writes the Ernie the Attorney Blog, Kathy Kirkman, who writes the Silicon
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:53.100]   Valley Media Law Blog, and is a partner at Wilson-Sensini in Palo Alto, and John Paulfree,
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:58.060]   who's a professor at Harvard Law School and the executive director of the Berkman Center
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.460]   for Internet and Society there.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.900]   We've got some really great folks that are going to weigh in on this stuff who know a
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.900]   whole lot about it.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:11.540]   There's me kind of wrangling them all, and our first guest, once that show gets edited
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:18.820]   and posted, is Hank Berry of Hummer Windblad, who's a venture capitalist and also the former
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.060]   CEO of a little company you may have heard of called Napster.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.340]   Yeah, Hank is fascinating.
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.100]   That's a really good interview, a really good panel.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.500]   I look forward to getting that out.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.060]   Yeah, we're real excited about that.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.860]   Since I get home, Denise.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.060]   It's great to have you on board the Twit Army.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.060]   It's wonderful to be on.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.220]   Are we allowed to continue?
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.420]   Is there a Bonnie around?
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.940]   Bonnie, I have how much more?
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.940]   10 minutes?
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.940]   10 minutes.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.940]   5 minutes?
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.940]   10 seconds.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.940]   10.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:45.940]   10.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.940]   20.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.940]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:48.940]   Thank you, Bonnie.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.740]   And thank you to Tim Workwin and the podcast brothers.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.820]   Tim has a podcast of his own, which is really great, with his brother, Emile.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.260]   And then, of course, is the organizer of this event.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.260]   Right.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.900]   Very kindly, they're letting us occupy the stage a little bit longer because we had quite
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.980]   a bit of a technical snake.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.420]   Frank Klunheris, why don't you come up here since he was a guy who helped us.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.420]   Help you, thank you.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.420]   You can't off the microphone, Denise.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.420]   Thank you.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.500]   Frank is with techfile.ca.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.420]   And we're recording on your Edderall.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.420]   So thank you.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.420]   Yeah, let's hope it works.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.660]   Yeah, you're in trouble if it doesn't.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.620]   Well, actually, you won't because nobody will know.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.620]   That looks good.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.860]   No one will know this existed.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.540]   The amazing Twit 71.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.140]   There'll be 10,000 people who saw it happen.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.420]   You won't believe it.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.940]   But it's lost forever to the ages.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.740]   You know, that's a good-- it happens.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.340]   I'm thinking maybe that's not a bad idea.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.340]   We could lose all the episodes.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.340]   Urban Myth.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.860]   Urban Myth Twit.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:43.860]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.780]   So tell us about techfile.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.460]   Well, we're still producing, doing our interview thing.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.460]   We're still alive.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.460]   We made it this far.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.380]   We went on a little bit of a hiatus for a while.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.380]   It's like pod fade.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.380]   That's right.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.820]   It's some family commitments I had to take care of, but they're back.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.620]   And I'm still doing my thing.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:05.260]   Interviewing podcasters and trendsetters in IPTV and podcasting.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:05.980]   It's a great show.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.220]   I've been on it many times.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:07.980]   Numerous times.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.620]   In fact, Steve and I in our hotel room.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.060]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.460]   Never mind.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:12.940]   Twice.
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:13.460]   Twice.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.780]   Two hotel rooms.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.220]   Hey, Chuck Tamasi's here too.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:16.980]   Check chat.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.820]   Come on up, Chuck, because I'm trying to get all the great tech
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.980]   podcasters on too.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.140]   Chuck Chat is another one of those podcasts
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.660]   that's been around for very long.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.020]   How long have you been doing that, Chuck Chat now?
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.460]   December 2004.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.660]   Some friends in Tech LaPel pins for you, gentlemen.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.620]   Tell us about friends in Tech.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.300]   It's a network of tech podcasts, yeah?
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.940]   Friends in Tech is a loose network of friends just
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.300]   out to have a good time cooperation, comradery,
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:49.100]   and work together without any real strong commitment of got
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.620]   to have a shot every week, got to have postings on the blog.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.060]   But it just comes naturally, organically.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.100]   We're having a good time and we enjoy it.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.540]   So say we all.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.700]   So say we all.
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.380]   So Ronald D. Moore this morning, Kevin.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.140]   Oh, over there.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.900]   Do you see them in Black Street?
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.420]   It's been Scully would say.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.940]   I see you have black.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.580]   So well, you know, one of the things I talked about this morning
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.740]   in the keynote was we are all in cooperation with each other.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.940]   There's not-- you know, we're not yet at the stage
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.980]   where we have to say, boy, Chuck's success
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.380]   is our detriment or anything like it.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.140]   There's a vast sea of listeners.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.860]   None of us have reached yet and anything we can do
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:26.940]   to reach that sea of listening.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.380]   Although I do have a story to share with you, Leo.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.580]   I was doing an audio tour at EAA in Oshkosh, Wisconsin,
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.460]   the great fly-in they do every year.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.220]   And I was interviewing the pilot of the B1B bomber
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.660]   that was parked there.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.860]   And he said, I said, could I interview you
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.780]   for an internet radio show?
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.380]   He goes, oh, podcast?
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.780]   He knew what a podcast was, which is a good step.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.340]   So the word he's getting out there,
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.540]   just a quick show of a-- a clap of hands, applause for armed
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.140]   forces people that are out there.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.380]   Yes, you bet.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.940]   Working hard.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.940]   And he said, do you listen to Twit?
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.100]   And I said, listen to it.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.340]   I went on it.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.460]   You know what really scares me is the number of air pilots
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.940]   who listen to Twit.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.940]   I get email all the time.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.860]   And you realize they're listening to Twit on--
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.380]   Right.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.140]   --read it while they're flying.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.340]   Some of them are listening right now in the air,
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.460]   flying a plane.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.740]   Please, pay attention.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:15.260]   Yes.
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:15.740]   Go down.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.060]   Look, look, look, look.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.540]   No, there's-- I got an email from a Qantas pilot the other day
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.420]   because we were talking about whether you could bring laptops
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:22.940]   on it.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.340]   So we've eased those restrictions.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.340]   In fact, I got a number of messages from pilots who said,
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.460]   you know, it's OK now or we have some limitations.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.900]   At the time, Qantas wasn't letting you plug in a Dell or a Mac
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.980]   because of the exploding batteries.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.940]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.420]   And I think they've eased that a little bit now.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.060]   It's not quite--
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.380]   It's not that enforceable anyway.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.660]   I mean, Virgin told me I couldn't.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.300]   And then I did anyway.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.300]   And how would they know?
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:44.820]   No, no.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.260]   They don't even know whether I was--
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.380]   What kind of computer I was using.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.060]   The exploding batteries.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.700]   How many exploding batteries did you hear about a year ago?
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.460]   You know, all of a sudden they're all blowing up.
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.300]   What's the deal?
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:55.980]   What are they using?
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.780]   Organic animal parts from China in these things?
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.020]   Is the electrolyte?
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.940]   It's a fat-driven battery.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.820]   Well, thank you, Chuck.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:04.940]   Appreciate your support.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.940]   Hey, can I get Matt up here real quickly from ChuckChat.com?
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.340]   ChuckChat.com, ChuckChat.com, ChuckChat.com.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:15.540]   We owe a lot to Cashfly, who provides bandwidth
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.220]   for some of the Twit podcasts, including the variations of the Twit.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.260]   The not-- AOL provides a bandwidth
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.140]   of the MP3 version of Twit and has since day one.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.820]   But when we started doing--
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.780]   Originally, we were doing AUGA, AAC, and low bit rate MP3s
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.060]   via BitTorrent.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.020]   And that proved to be--
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:35.020]   I mean, if it's podcasting, it's hard.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.380]   BitTorrent's works.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.660]   But Cashfly stepped forward and said, you know,
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.060]   you can use our service.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.300]   And we're very grateful.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.420]   In fact, many of the new podcasts we're launching,
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.580]   including this week in law, will be launching on that cash.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.100]   I appreciate it.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.820]   I mean, it's weird because you guys are definitely
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.700]   one of our more popular netcasts.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.100]   I mean, we do Ignatian, all the revision three shows.
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.020]   And it's weird.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.620]   Every show you add, your traffic just goes, tik, tik, tik, tik.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.460]   Yes.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.260]   Yeah, and actually you're hosting the new Windows podcast
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.020]   with Paul Therrot, Windows Weekly.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.260]   You told me the other day it was half a gig of it a second.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.420]   Yeah, about 550 megabits a second or so you were putting--
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.820]   I don't know how we do that.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.420]   That's amazing.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.340]   I don't know how you do that.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.220]   That's really amazing.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.380]   So we thank you very much.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:19.900]   Thank you very much.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.820]   Really appreciate Cashfly.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.540]   Cashfly is one of the really great organizations.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.460]   They stepped forward when revision three
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.140]   was-- didn't have enough bandwidth to get its system.
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.580]   The new system came out.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.220]   And everything crashed.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.660]   And Matt and Cashfly came forward right away.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.060]   And so we really appreciate the help.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:43.580]   Who else-- I promised this guy, Craig, push him up here.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.140]   I promised other people a chance to get up here.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.580]   And I can't remember who I invited up.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.540]   I guess Paul won.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.380]   Oh, podcast-- it's Robert Walsh.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:52.940]   Robert Walsh.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.460]   Oh my god, I don't know what you look like.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.060]   So I know it's you.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.340]   This is one of the great podcasters.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.580]   I've only heard your voice, Robert.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.500]   Most people just say you don't look anything like I expected.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.740]   And then they make a really weird face.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.780]   You know, that's something radio people have put up with for years.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.340]   Right, Scott?
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.140]   It's a really depressing thing.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.820]   We meet people and they go, oh, gosh, your voice
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.820]   sounds so much better than you.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.740]   Look, it's a depressing thing.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.980]   Well, you've been doing-- how long have you
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.020]   been doing podcasts for one long?
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.180]   December 2004.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.420]   Long time.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.020]   And you've interviewed pretty much everybody.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:29.380]   All the keynotes here, plus all the podcasters of the year
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.260]   and quite a few other podcasters that people probably
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.180]   never have heard of.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.020]   And that's the best part is the ones that people have never
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:35.580]   heard of.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.220]   Did you do Rob Moore, who did the keynote,
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.380]   the Battlestar Galatica keynote?
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.060]   Yeah, I had Ronald on in May.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.580]   Ronald, yeah.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.460]   And he was really fun to talk about.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.860]   It was a great keynote.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.860]   I mean, he--
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:45.700]   I was neat.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.420]   I become a fan of Battlestar Galatica.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.180]   And it's really great.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.140]   And for the Rika people, I just had Colin Ferguson on from
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.460]   Eureka, who does a podcast for you.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:52.980]   That's Rika.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.340]   And so they're starting to get the message that this is a
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.380]   great way to market, to get the world out.
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.140]   And especially to that sort of audience.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:37:59.580]   The geeks.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.340]   Yes.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:00.820]   Yes.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.700]   Yeah, they know, don't they?
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.820]   And Colin, he was actually going to create the podcast on his
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.540]   own, the sci-fi channel found out about it, and said, oh,
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.900]   no, no, no, we'll help you.
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.100]   We'll send you the same recorder.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.260]   They send Ron Moore.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:12.940]   You're kidding.
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:13.740]   That's neat.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.700]   That's really neat.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.060]   But he gives a lot of good behind the scenes.
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.340]   It's fun.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.580]   Well, what Ron does, basically, is what you would get on the
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.300]   DVD, but the day of.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.300]   The director's commentary.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.980]   Well, and probably more authentic and real, too.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.260]   I mean, if he's got the cigarette, one had him booze
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.260]   and the other.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.420]   And I may tell you, those silons.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.460]   But I hate him.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.340]   You're not going to hear anyone really criticize their
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.620]   scene in a DVD movie.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.900]   He mentioned he was smoking, but what he didn't mention when
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.380]   I--
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.780]   he mentioned my interview was that people were sending
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:49.380]   emails wondering what he was smoking.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.740]   And it is cigarettes for the record.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.060]   I'm sure it was.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.820]   Not that we would encourage that behavior.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.380]   A monthly young people.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.380]   That would be Nate and Dye, if you want to hear that other.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.340]   Nate and Dye.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.420]   They promote it.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:00.900]   Evelyn.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.060]   A little bit.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.220]   So what's next for a podcast 411?
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.500]   Oh, I want to have Denise on.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.300]   Good.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.940]   Now that she's got a podcast, I've been waiting for her to
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.700]   do a podcast that I've been waiting for a year.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.180]   Have you?
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:12.980]   Oh, that's great.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.820]   Yeah, matter of fact, when I did the interview with you,
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.060]   I recommended--
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.460]   Well, that's how I found Denise.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.580]   Oh, one of many.
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.140]   One of many.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.900]   Now, a lot of people suggested Denise Howell.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.220]   And yeah, we're glad to have--
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.020]   I actually have another podcast at IT Conversations.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.060]   It's called Sound Policy.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.980]   So you could have interviewed me before, Robert.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:28.620]   But that's OK with me.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.340]   I forgot.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.780]   Yeah, you were on IT Conversations.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.580]   That's right.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.020]   But actually, your name just came up in the legal panel
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.220]   here at the Expo.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.060]   Dun, dun, dun.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.540]   Duh, dun.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.260]   No, in a very good way.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:44.100]   That you're actually putting release agreements for your
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.620]   guests and things up as an online form.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.100]   Is that right?
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.740]   What I do-- every interview I do an audio release, at the
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.260]   start of the interview, and I say, I'm now recording.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.460]   We're not yet in the show.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.180]   When I say, welcome to the show, we start.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:00.900]   I edit heavy.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.340]   At any point you want to take something out, you tell me.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.340]   Otherwise, everything's fair game.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.980]   Feel free to start over.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.860]   And that's the beauty of audio editing.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.360]   Right.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.100]   And that is not live.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.060]   Because sometimes I do interview companies.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.740]   I've had POD show on.
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.740]   I've had Yahoo on.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.500]   I'm trying to get Apple on.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.580]   And you want to make sure that they feel comfortable with
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.100]   on the show.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.820]   And when you do the editing, that you don't get sued at
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.860]   the end for making it not what it was.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.340]   Which would be POD Parsons from GoDaddy.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.100]   They definitely took advantage of that opportunity to ask
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:35.860]   me to take things out.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.660]   Interesting.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.300]   So now Denise scared the pants off.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:39.820]   Well, no.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.980]   She gave me the willies.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:41.420]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.580]   I didn't want to be kidding.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.820]   Because I was at her lecture yesterday about all the legal
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.500]   ramifications of stuff we do.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.780]   And we haven't done it.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.660]   We haven't protected ourselves in any form or fashion.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.380]   I didn't ask you for a release before I put you on here.
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.660]   I don't edit a thing.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.820]   Whatever you say goes out.
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.180]   So if anybody has a problem, please call Denise Howell
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.580]   because she's our new counsel.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.460]   And just remember we have no money.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.460]   We have no money.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.780]   No, don't bother suing anybody.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.700]   Speaking of which, I'd like to remind you, this podcast
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.460]   brought to you by Visa.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.060]   If you are-- actually, it isn't.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.460]   I think we're done with the Visa thing.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   So forget I said that.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.540]   Mastercard.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.900]   No, don't say that.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.300]   But it is brought to you by Dell.
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.620]   And we do want to thank the folks at Dell for providing us
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.780]   with support for the podcast.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.140]   And remind everybody, we've got some great picks on our
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.060]   website at twitter.tv/dell.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.220]   That's the Leo's picks page.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.500]   And if you're buying a Dell, visit there first.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.300]   And then go through there and then everybody will be happy,
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:46.700]   including me, especially me, twit.tv/dell.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.620]   We thank them for their support of this podcast.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.620]   I think we're going to wrap things up.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.900]   We're running out of time.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.700]   It's been really great.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.340]   Thank you, Rob.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.660]   We'll look forward to the next podcast, 411.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.180]   Podcast the number four, number one, number one.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:58.740]   Dot com.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:41:59.940]   Dot c no m.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.460]   That's easy.
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.460]   It's just bloody easy.
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.260]   And it's going to stay podcast for a 411.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.740]   Although I did register blogcast 411 when Microsoft was
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.540]   going around about blogcast.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.180]   And then there was what?
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.140]   Nanocast?
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:11.660]   Yeah.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.900]   So every six months, people want to change the name.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.380]   And then GoDaddy has this big spike in domain name
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.780]   registrations.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.860]   And at the end of the day, the only one that gets happy
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.780]   about the name change is Bob Parsons.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.820]   It's all the conspiracy on Bob Parsons' part to get the
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.860]   name changed.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.540]   Well, I didn't register a net anything.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.340]   So you don't have to either.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.740]   If you want to read Denise's blog, it's a really great
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.300]   legal blog.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.260]   What's the URL for that?
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:35.580]   That's it.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.940]   BagandBagage.com.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.900]   And you have a Vox blog.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.900]   It was great.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.420]   I was looking over Denise's shoulder at the Podcast
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.060]   Academy yesterday, and she's blogging.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:45.740]   It's really great.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.940]   It's really neat that you just--
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.460]   Yeah, it's fun.
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.580]   I used that basically just to throw up YouTube clips and
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:50.860]   things.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.860]   We saw a great clip.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.940]   Tim from Frenchmaids TV showed that was a
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:55.980]   hysterical clip.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.780]   It was an NBC promo.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:58.700]   From YouTube?
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.460]   From YouTube.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:03.460]   That NBC is uploading intentionally to YouTube.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.500]   It's not to promo, it shows.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.780]   And it's so funny.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.580]   And it's so great.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:10.380]   And a model for anybody in the corporate world who wants to
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:15.460]   see what a good, funny, compelling promo looks like.
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.540]   Well, self-mocking.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.740]   And that was what was great about it.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.300]   It wasn't self-serious.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.340]   It mocked itself.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:21.420]   And that's really important.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.460]   I think that's kind of part of the culture here.
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.500]   We don't take ourselves that seriously.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.860]   And when that big network executive comes on, it takes
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.540]   itself seriously.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.340]   That's what the question is.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.740]   And Tim will be a guest on it.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.580]   I just interviewed him.
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.100]   So he'll be coming up on the podcast
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.340]   for one in about two weeks.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.700]   It's a really great podcast to listen to.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.100]   It's like kind of the actor studio where you really get to
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.580]   hear the behind the scenes.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.140]   Scott Born is at--
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.540]   let's make a little announcement.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:44.300]   What do you say?
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.540]   I'm very happy to announce that the iLifeZone, which you've
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.900]   maybe heard of or not, is now formally part of the
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.500]   Twit podcast.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.900]   We're very happy to have you.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:59.260]   iLifeZone is a great podcast that it explains--
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.180]   it's for beginners of how to podcast on using the iLifecast.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.620]   It's very how-to oriented.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.700]   We're slow on punditry and news, high on tips and tricks.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.260]   And high in production value.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.420]   High on production values.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:12.620]   And of course, you can catch me with Merlin Mann and Alex,
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.220]   as you as we do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.220]   Really?
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:16.580]   We're starting to--
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.340]   Which we're supposed to do this coming Tuesday, but
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:20.020]   you're not going to be there, so I'm going to have to do it
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:20.380]   myself.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.860]   It's another new podcast.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:26.260]   I've added like five podcasts today.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:27.820]   I just can't stop.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.100]   Alex Lindsey is from the Pixel Core.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.540]   And if it weren't for you, half of these podcasts wouldn't
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:33.060]   happen.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:33.700]   So I thank you.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.340]   Well, we--
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:34.340]   We--
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.820]   --cluting this one, by the way.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.460]   Who'd have what's on the happen?
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.580]   We have a lot of fun playing.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.420]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.620]   Pixelcore.com.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.220]   That's correct.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.420]   And Steve Gibson, we're going to see you on security now.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.700]   We've got one actually.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.860]   As soon as I'm done here--
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:46.460]   In the camp.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:46.980]   --it's done.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.420]   It's going to go up episode 59, all about parallels.
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.900]   Of course, by the time you're hearing this, it will have
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.980]   already been up.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.780]   Don't confuse me.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:54.500]   Oh, that's right.

[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:56.540]   It's confusing.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.020]   That's the time.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.260]   It's the podcast time war.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:00.740]   And we really want to thank everybody who
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.940]   sat through all of the technical difficulties
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.140]   getting this running.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.780]   There would be no podcasting without all of you
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.540]   as podcasters.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.940]   It is really a pleasure to be part of this community.

[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:40.620]   This is crap everywhere.
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.620]   It's ads everywhere.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.620]   This was a gathering in the top.
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
