[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.080]   I'm used to it
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.600]   And we've got Nicholas daily on senior reporter a consumer reports. Hey Nicholas. How's it going? Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.320]   Doing okay, how are things that consumer reports because I feel like that is that's a publication people don't talk about enough
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.400]   But I feel like it's still super valuable for many many readers, right? Yeah, no, we're still kicking
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.600]   I think we're nearly a hundred years old at this point
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:09.680]   But yes, still kicking around I primarily cover laptops and wireless routers and write to repair stuff and and other fun stuff like that
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.960]   But yeah, still around still writing refrigerators and lawnmowers and cars and I guess EVs are now a
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.600]   Thing now even I mean listen even I'm like reviewing EVs now. So yeah, I'm reviewing e-bikes right now. So I'm watching you
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.880]   Nice. I mean we can talk about that if anybody's thinking about EVs or alternative means of transportation at some point
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.800]   But yeah, so thank you Nicholas and yeah looking forward to this track guys
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.360]   This is a great group of folks and I feel like to kick things off
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.720]   It's one of two things it feels like every every week
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.800]   I do think agile podcast as well and every week we were looking at the news
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   It's either do their AI or it's whatever the hell Elon Musk is doing now like how he is messing up
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   So do you guys have a preference?
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.760]   Any any votes here AI or Elon Musk? Do we start with the good or the bad or I guess the in between?
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.680]   I'm all about AI these days all about the AI. Okay, Doc Rock
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.880]   There there's a bunch of things happening. It's not as big as the past few weeks where I feel like you know
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.040]   We saw chat we saw GPD for get an ounce. We saw Google release barred
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.960]   To the public and this week there there's like less major news, but a few like important things
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.840]   I think something a lot of people were talking about was the news that President Biden
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.280]   Basically says that you know
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   He's eyeing the dangerous round AI and is aware that this is a thing that we need to be paying attention to and unfortunately
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.640]   That Reuters article is a is link block for me now
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.760]   But I saw the story going around because it's interesting that Biden I think has like through osmosis and through you know
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.680]   Whatever people are telling him is like gathered enough around what's going on with AI
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.320]   What do you guys feel about this response because I feel like this this is
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.000]   This is kind of how the government is viewing things now
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.760]   It seems like they're aware of the danger but also trying to tell companies to be a little more careful about how quickly
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.960]   They move forward any any thoughts on this
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.040]   I think we're going to see a slowdown starting
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.840]   Because this first
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.100]   It's not really the first six months. Let's just be straight on as we all know because we're in tech this stuff has been
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.840]   Popping for a while
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.600]   All myriad source of apps that we use even something as simple as you know
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.520]   Taking a picture in any of the various phones and the phones bless the picture before you decide to send it out
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.840]   Like that's our into and so we've known for a while
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.640]   But to the Mughal verse this is all relatively
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.840]   Relatively new to them and the scary thing to them is the the general to AI
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.420]   It's mostly scary because the news is having fun making it scary
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.000]   You know, I mean I think it is still it could still be plenty scary too
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   But it has it has some fear stuff in it for the most part us general tech community people
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.180]   We're we're not looking to do anything ill we're trying to have fun and get to whatever our favorite sci-fi movie was back in the day
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.760]   Team Star Wars. I
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.760]   think that now
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.160]   It is good that they're paying attention
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.440]   I just hope that they don't do something weird dumb knee jerk reaction and like we're just gonna ban it like idly
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.040]   Rather than trying to figure it out. Let's just come on
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.760]   You know try to Aloha more it's gone out of here, you know, like I don't want to see that right?
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.880]   I want to see it continue to move and
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.720]   Do the amazing things that I can do?
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.600]   Unfortunately, our culture is greedy enough that there will always be people that try to book the system. I
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.680]   Mean I totally see that
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.920]   Anthony Nicholas like what are your what are your thoughts on Biden's response to AI and I mean
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:54.280]   Where do you guys stand right now because things have gotten it is wild it is wild how quickly things have progressed like, you know, doc rock
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   I hear you we know certain things we've seen computer vision
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.840]   We seem like Google photos
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.280]   We've seen our you know our iPhones like touching up our photos
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:08.680]   But now it's like they are straight up just pulling the vast like resources of human knowledge to talk to us in very human sounding ways
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.960]   And pull facts and to me that is the point where it's getting a little scary
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.800]   But yeah, Anthony Nicholas any any thoughts on what Biden is saying? I
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:23.040]   Mean I'm not necessarily convinced that like and there'll be like any immediate action just because he's talked about it
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.280]   I mean my reaction really was oh
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.160]   This is happening somebody is telling him what's going on
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.200]   You know certainly there probably some people of his ear who are like, oh, we should be concerned about this
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.920]   I think that
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:44.320]   generally the the lag between oh we make a statement of we are concerned to actual regulate regulation is
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.160]   Takes a while I mean certainly we've seen that with you know crypto that there are a lot of statements not a lot of actual
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.680]   action maybe that's starting to change so I
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:00.960]   Think it was interesting. I'm not convinced that there's going to be sort of any immediate steps taken from by the government
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.120]   Government is not famously fast in America, especially when comes to regulation or new tech
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.280]   Nicholas your thoughts. Yeah, no, I can't imagine Biden's devoting too much of his day to thinking about
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.840]   AI to be I feels like he has bigger things on his plate
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:23.800]   then like chat GPT or any of the AI kind of hustlers out there so I don't really have any
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.680]   Not coffee, but it's just feels like it's something that someone slipped under his desk
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.480]   I'm sure somebody sent him the like super cool Brandon photos, right?
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.640]   Or like the sort of like it the Biden memes they're going around
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.920]   I'm sure he's seen the Pope meme and I'm sure he's like oh, this is the thing and people are probably talked about the risks
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.320]   But you know doc one of my favorite sci-fi
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:53.120]   You know stories franchises is battle star Galactica and famously there's no way I in battle star Galactica because they they destroyed us
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.840]   It was very bad and that that was kind of like a core point of that
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.680]   I mean that goes back to like foundation and so many other stories too
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.000]   I don't want to be too too fearful here, but it does feel like I
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.760]   Feel like everyone is feeling the sort of whiplash that's happening
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.440]   It's like oh this thing is cool and oh this thing is moving really fast and oh I can't I can't keep up with what's happening
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.160]   Oh, this thing is reshaping a huge portion of culture so quickly
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.960]   It's you know mimicking the Pope in Balenciaga in a Balenciaga puffy jacket
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.200]   It is doing things at a time when misinformation is so rampant and so dangerous
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.080]   To me, it's like all these things coming together that makes it kind of scary like dr
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.720]   You think we're moving too quickly because you said you were worried about the slowdown
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:41.240]   Alright actually yeah, I don't the thing that I'm having a problem with which is just me
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.240]   is
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   We don't want to take responsibility
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.440]   for vetting our own facts so
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.160]   misinformation kind of sort of shouldn't exist because
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.960]   You can personally double check everything double triple check and yes
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.400]   There are cases where you can triple triple triple triple check
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.680]   And then you know still miss but people aren't even checking
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.840]   They're just taking things at face value
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.640]   And then trying to blame someone else for giving them the wrong information
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.960]   And i'm like yeah, no, that's that's
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:22.760]   That's not a thing. I mean we're yeah, we've already proven we're bad at finding you know discerning facts and information
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.760]   But the AI thing is just like it is so easy. It makes it so easy like you could be surfing twitter and just be like
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   Oh, you get a flash of a Balenciaga of pope and you're like your brain doesn't have time to figure out if that's real or not
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.800]   But flash forward to you at the bar with friends or something like oh, yeah
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.400]   It's the pope wearing puffy jacket sound like what here's the thing the blinsey other popo pope went to me was funny because
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.440]   Okay, so let's just take any
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.040]   octogenarian uncle
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.880]   Who do you know at his age is rocking a Balenciaga?
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.200]   I mean that was just I mean it's supposed to know those standards even the pope
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.920]   Like he doesn't know just like just like niggas said about why didn't knows his AI?
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.960]   Wow man, pope don't know what Balenciaga is you know, he's been sheltered his whole life. He don't know
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.640]   He's he's up that he is in Italy. He's in a pretty
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:21.560]   That's funny. Yeah, the Balenciaga was seen as like an upgrade over the pope's normal like robes like there's one pope
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.400]   That Balenciaga jacket anyone could buy with enough money. So it's like there you go
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.840]   He's already got the most exclusive clothing items on the planet so
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.800]   Totally totally I feel like that's part of the thing. We're like part of me is like now that can't be real
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.600]   But also could easily be real pope has access to like vast amounts of wealth and the the point is he doesn't show it
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.520]   But we know the Vatican's like all all dalte up with all sorts of stuff. So
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:51.240]   Kind of in the AI news. We did see the story about bloomberg announcing its own large language model
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.760]   um
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.120]   And this one's interesting because uh, I feel like a lot of people don't realize you know
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.520]   Bloomberg at its core is a technology company that's something Michael Bloomberg
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.080]   Spent a lot of time talking about when he was mayor of New York and when I was covering startups there
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.080]   And uh when I was on uh on the team with Anthony back then
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.440]   um
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.640]   Bloomberg would always talk about like yeah, he's the original data guy
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.920]   For people who don't know bloomberg is more than just a new site or you know a newspaper
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.240]   They are known for the bloomberg terminals, which
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.760]   you know
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.720]   Track and offer vast amounts of financial data to to investment bankers and all sorts of people
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.360]   Those terminals cost tons of money to to access and that is bloomberg's big money
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:40.120]   So they announced a large, uh language model a 50 billion parameter language model is totally tuned to uh,
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.800]   financial tasks
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.080]   And I just I almost feel like man it took them
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.400]   I guess it didn't take them that long, but I felt like this was inevitable because of all companies to do this
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.320]   It would be the company that's already like made its entire existence on data
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.960]   Um any any thoughts on this and how this could change things for for bankers or the financial, you know sector?
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.520]   I will say that one concern I have is that
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   What what has been surprising to me in terms of this current wave of like chat gpt type
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.240]   Examples and use cases
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.800]   Is realizing how bad a is at that checking that like there are the things that I thought
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.040]   Would be really
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.200]   In my head like a I would always sound robotic, but it would be like very factual
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.280]   And it turns out to be the opposite of at least if we take you know chat gpt
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.240]   Sort of the the paradigm of current ai like is actually it sounds very natural
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.240]   But it's just full of bs and full of wrong facts now you imagine like you're somebody trying to you know
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:46.200]   Trade stocks based on financial information and you're using this interface that half the time just gives you
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.520]   Incorrect information. I feel like that could go pretty badly
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.160]   I mean, I'm sure they've they've got this through but um, it's one of those things that sounds like a good fit
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.360]   but like
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.320]   Actually, I don't know that I I've never been
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:05.160]   You know day trade or anything, but I would be a little bit concerned about using this too extensively right away
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.920]   I feel like here's the difference though. So here's the difference in their data say
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:14.760]   Okay, so chat gpt. I'm trying to help so many of my friends get their head around this chat gpt
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.120]   Right now is doogie housing right um you guys might be way too young for that
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:27.000]   Anyway, he was the the the doctor from like middle school like 14 year old doctor graduated
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.320]   Even as the kid. I was like, I don't think this premise holds up, but okay
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.080]   Yeah, well, let me let you know the real deal doogie housing
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:39.960]   Michael when he is across the street at jabston medical school here at university of hawaii and he's already a doctor
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.160]   And he's what 17 years old. So we actually have the real deal doogie housing across the street for me
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.560]   um anyway, so this
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.880]   This thing is like that
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.520]   He has all the intelligence in the world
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.080]   But not enough experience
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.280]   That he still needs coaching from the experienced people
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.200]   So the premise of that show was always he can do all these incredible things
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:08.040]   But he's still a kid so mom and dad, you know friends and co-workers had the rally around him help him up
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   This is where the AI model is right now
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.560]   What bloomberg is doing is working off a data set that's very specific data set
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:21.240]   With chat gpt is proprietary stuff that only bloomberg cat gpt is done is comb the internet
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:27.880]   So the reason why chat gpt is so bad at fact checking is twofold one it combed the internet
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.200]   So it grabbed all kind of crazy nonsense, but at the same token
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:40.440]   People don't even know how to decide what's fact and fixing yet people can be easily snowed
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.160]   So there is a lot of information
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.600]   Written by people in their brain as factual and they really really mean it
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:55.080]   We all have that one uncle or neighbor that really believes in the shadow people and slender man and whatever
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:00.760]   And i mean at best that i hope that's what they believe in this letter man and not another thing
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.640]   Oh man, my neighbor really believes linder man is real
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.680]   I'm not even joking right it's kind of a thing we cracked up laughing
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.920]   And he always talking about the parallel universe
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.160]   Also this other crease still be such a genuinely nice guy that we don't really make fun of him
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.080]   But if he had a blog and he had been writing all of this stuff down for the last 10 years
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.600]   That's part of the data set and the model is too young to know how to filter
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.320]   The difference but the model will grow up just like a teenager
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:33.400]   I mean tp-d4 is supposedly better than chat gpt with gpt 3.5 right so and what
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.120]   What they're saying here is the blinberg thing
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.640]   Um, I forget which version of gpt it specifically based on is based on four
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:48.360]   Um, but it is getting better like the things you're talking about Anthony like that that does worry me too like we've adding gadgets
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:54.520]   Um, we've we've test out chat gpt doing things like hey, make me a table of specs comparing
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.040]   You know the iPhone 13 to the pixel 7 or 6 or something
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:04.520]   And sometimes those specs would be wrong for no reason like something would just it would give me wrong dimensions or wrong weight
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.480]   I'm like, where are you pulling this from so that does kind of
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.480]   Somebody wrote it wrong in the net
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.800]   That's the part that's crazy. Somebody actually wrote it wrong in the net
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   Okay, like first is right when it's time to get a phone right that week that we're waiting
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.320]   We already pre-ordered it. Let's be honest right but that week that we're waiting. What are we doing?
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.280]   We're watching, you know, you guys in the other contemporaries, you know being the ex two-ah, man
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.200]   I was there back in the beginning. That's what we people used to come into our content
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.360]   We always blew up doing phone week
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:39.320]   Which which incredible to me is even then sometimes whoever has the phone and doing a report
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.520]   They get stuff wrong from a conceptual level because there's a amount of human in it
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.560]   And it's not that it's a spec or something
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:54.920]   It's the way they might look at a particular feature and maybe not fully understand it because when people don't realize about this tech people
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.800]   We get a box of stuff every week
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.600]   We got so many things that we're doing and you kind of mix things together
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.120]   You sometimes you got it in your hand for two days before apple says give it back
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.680]   So you didn't get a chance to dig all the way deep and you get to flame wars in the comments
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.160]   I can't believe you missed this well you come over here and try to write seven articles in
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.600]   Yeah, you can't do it all man with the editor barking down your neck, right?
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.800]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:24.280]   So if that's why even some of the information it got itself is wrong because all of us have written something wrong in a
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.880]   In the tech article at one point in time. Yeah, that is also I guess another reason not to be too afraid of any any of these like
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.920]   Generative chatbots because they're still depending on the information from us and they can't fully replace us yet
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.360]   But who knows who knows like where things will go it feels like it is moving
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:47.640]   Just so quickly and to me that is my main concern because like guys we we have lived through the era of crypto dudes
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.720]   You know, we've lived through the web three era
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:55.800]   Meta is still called meta because you know, Mark Zuckerberg really wanted to bank on the metaverse
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.040]   and like it felt like we've had these waves of like, oh, this is the next big thing and
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:06.040]   Hasn't really worked out well for a lot of those crowds my fear is like i'm looking at AI and being like, oh, yeah
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:11.640]   This is actually the thing. This is the thing that is that is going to make a big impact for the way we live our lives
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.320]   And we are utterly prepared for it as a society as a you know
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.120]   The government isn't these companies aren't but the only thing kind of forcing this is open AI and like the the competitive spirit
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.520]   Right everybody everybody wants to be in on this otherwise they're going to be left behind
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.640]   So that's why the Microsoft thing happens so quickly and that's why google is being forced to push bard out
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.720]   Um, there's some good analysis from niem and lab about the bloomberg thing
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   Um kind of putting a little bit of cold water on it
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.440]   Um, you know the point is like we're going to see a lot of these like very domain specific
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.320]   Uses of large language models. Um a couple weeks ago adobe
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.120]   And in vidia had a whole bunch of news announcing like how they were going to make it easier for other companies to
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.680]   Kind of build their own things based on their specific knowledge. So we're going to see more of these things
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.000]   We don't know how good they're going to be and their usefulness is going to depend on like the source data
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.440]   Um, the bloomberg one is interesting because it's bloomberg. It's frickin
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.800]   They have they have like the financial data. They have
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:14.280]   So much information. Um, I have never used a bloomberg terminal the extent that I have seen when in action
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.760]   I think is on the show industry on hbo, which is very good show. Are you guys watching industry?
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.040]   Oh, now you have still love it still in my succession mode
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:27.560]   Wait, andly you're not watching in this because I feel like it is very much like among the things you guys would talk about on
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.360]   Uh, I feel like succession scratches that itch for me
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   But I think one succession is overall catch up on industry. Yeah, so I will turn this out
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.040]   Everybody knows successions a great show. Everyone's told you to watch succession
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.640]   But industry on hbo is like is very much like that vein
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.880]   It's almost like they're in the same universe to be honest
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:51.000]   But it's set in london at investment bank and it follows a young group of bankers like being terrible people basically, but also
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.160]   Um, I think there's a lot of statements on like the the sense of the state of banking right now and the world we're in
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:03.800]   Um, doc rock you had mentioned that uh, italy announced that they want to ban chat gpt
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.680]   Uh, we can definitely talk further about that. Um, I believe they have done it
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.320]   Yeah, fully right with all the way in
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.800]   And they went they did that because of privacy violations and
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.320]   I feel okay, maybe a little too much but also
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.440]   It is interesting that there's a government that's out there enough to be like, hey, this this is bad for privacy
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.560]   On many many levels like maybe we should do something but I think for a lot of as we've seen with like, um
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.040]   Uh, we've seen with like the european privacy rules like sometimes they tend to go too far
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.600]   But i'm kind of impressed they did something at all
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.760]   Do you guys have any thoughts about this because I don't think it's ever going to be banned fully in america
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.840]   I feel like ai something
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.600]   American companies are just like fully all in on the government wants it to be a thing
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.520]   We want to defeat china, which is what everybody you know is is the main
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.880]   Call to action right now. So I feel like this will never happen in the us but any thoughts on italy doing this
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.480]   I mean, I guess if I think about it more just like domestically
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:06.680]   I feel like the what we're likely more likely to see more of is like, you know, I mean this is a little bit old now
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.720]   But the you know, new york schools ban chat gpt right and yeah, and I think like
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.080]   There may be more like banned in certain contexts than you are likely to see it completely banned
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.720]   Also, how do you have gpt in the school right there? They're gonna go home. They're gonna go
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:28.280]   Library wifi or something and you know, do whatever right and I mean I think in general my feeling is
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.440]   that
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.720]   you know that
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.280]   People are gonna find get access to this in some way these technologies are gonna be developed and so
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.760]   You can maybe do something like this in the short term because you're just like oh my god
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:46.440]   Like this is so scary. We need to figure it out and so let's ban it while we like put other rules in place
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.640]   Maybe makes more sense, but it's like pulling the emergency brakes while you while you try to figure it out. I guess yeah
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.640]   Right, but the idea that like, you know
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:00.200]   That's that you're just like well, we're just gonna shut this out and like the rest of the world will sort of just go on without us seems
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.720]   Not like a long-term solution. Maybe not a great solution
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.960]   I guess if you want to stay competitive which which is the sort of like weird push and pull nicolas
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.920]   Do you have any thoughts on this?
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.800]   Because I I know I would yeah if I were just an Italian
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   Person I would kind of be bummed out that my government has audit has just like banned you can't use it anymore
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.400]   It's like okay. Well, that's
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.440]   If I just moved across the board it's a germany can I use it as if if I moved to like to your cut
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.360]   It doesn't it doesn't you know, I guess it feels like a like you said like an emergency break
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.480]   Let's just hold on for a second. So maybe that's okay, but just to kind of an indefinite ban
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.760]   Uh, that seems like if I were an Italian entrepreneur
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:43.720]   I would be like well why am I even here then like if I'm not gonna have access to tools and tech this place is no longer working for me
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.880]   I'll go somewhere where I can develop my talents elsewhere, you know
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.680]   It is funny how we're seeing different people approaches idea too because it was a last week or two weeks ago
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.880]   There was the the letter from the what the future of humanity institute the the thing that you'll almost back
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:03.480]   To say hey, let's put a six month pause on the AI on you know gpt beyond chat gpt or beyond gpt
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:09.560]   For uh because we haven't my companies have not cut up yet. That is a lot of this always seems self-serving
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.440]   Uh, but if a government does it that just seems out of fear
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.960]   I don't I don't know like fully like what the plan is or they're just gonna sit back and
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.520]   See what happens before they allow it again
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:25.320]   Um, but this is funny. Yeah, this to me my um, my niece goes to guy Kawasaki's all of mother
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.000]   And I wouldn't look at the date real quick February 17th
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.200]   They sent a letter to all the parents and i'm on the list as her uncle
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.000]   I don't know how I got on the list, but my sister. Love put me there
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.840]   Um, and so I could see now and it's from the chancellor
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.480]   And he's like I know you guys read all this stuff and you're hearing about the fears of going what's going on
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.680]   You're hearing about schools in new york and other, you know districts locking it down
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.480]   Here's going to be our approach at at eel body school
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:57.000]   We are putting together a task force of teachers and senior students
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.800]   That will look at how we can effectively use this for the betterment of our students
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.240]   We're not going to ban it
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.120]   But we are going to take a responsible and sensible approach
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:15.240]   And we have an ever active team working any parents that want to come and join you if you want to volunteer to be on this panel
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:21.320]   Whatever, please come in and we're going to meet every week, you know on zoom and see how it's going. So
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.080]   It's funny right the private school takes that approach
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:32.760]   And when they get out in the world people get mad because oh how come the private school kids always have a leg up on you know
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   The regular school kids because the the current
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:43.000]   Administrations in a lot of states they don't want to spend the time or maybe they don't get paid enough to they have literally
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.680]   Actually don't get paid enough. Let me get enough. Right. There's no, this is it's an impossible task
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.040]   We're talking about right like hey this thing that didn't exist six months ago
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:57.000]   Uh, uh, you need to be an expert in it now and you know, also we need to have a we need to have a console
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.040]   We need to figure out like how we integrate this into our our like teaching, you know regimen
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:08.120]   It seems so rough. I can understand why italy was just like no no thanks or why no time no time no money
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.520]   Nobody really understands it
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.960]   No, but the thing that I wonder and I have to call a couple of my my classmates from college that live there
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:22.440]   I'm like yo, can you just pop through a vpn and still get in because if you blocked it and the vpn still work
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.360]   Then that's just I mean usually usually yes usually yes, right
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.800]   It's uh, it's a weird thing
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.360]   It is a weird thing is sort of like I remember when the internet was becoming a thing in the mid-90s
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.720]   And I was like I was lucky enough to have a computer at home to spend time tinkering and playing around with html and doing stuff
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.720]   So when I went to school, uh, the librarian would always be like what it what are you doing?
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.440]   Like why why are you going to websites so quickly?
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.600]   Why are you hitting refresh so often?
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.200]   Which is the question I have gotten because like it's not loading fast enough
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.120]   um
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.840]   Having that opportunity at home gave me a leg up and I do feel like having a chance to play with chat gpt
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.840]   in in the actual school environment is going to be
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.760]   Kind of essential for kids moving forward, but we have no clue
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.640]   We have no idea kind of how this stuff is going to affect anything
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.920]   um
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.720]   Because the New York schools are worried about plagiarism right they're worried about
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.000]   um
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.240]   Kids using it just to like uh have a have a paper written immediately or
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.760]   Solve their homework problems super quickly, right? Like that seems fair to just pause it for now. I guess
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.640]   I'm not a teacher. Yeah, but
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.400]   This is my thoughts on it and i'm probably going to kids a lot of flight for this
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:35.000]   We know in school. We all had our favorite teachers whether it was in high school or you know in college or whatever
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.520]   Your favorite teachers, you normally did really good on the test because they taught you
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.000]   If i'm teaching you properly you have no need to cheat on the test
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.800]   whatsoever
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:54.040]   If you're prepared to play a sport or something at the height of its existence, you don't have to cheat tambre
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.840]   Um, but if it's lacking
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.920]   Um, then you decide to start taking shortcuts
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.880]   And again, I got it. This is partially on us because we're not paying them enough
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:10.360]   Which is a whole different conversation, but students don't even try to cheat on the teachers that they like
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.040]   Well, it's not even about teaching on uh cheating on like tests, right?
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:20.920]   This is like you get homework, right? You get a weekend assignment of like write 500 words a thousand words on this book or something
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.240]   That then it's like, okay
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.320]   A lot of kids will want to engage on it, but maybe people will use strategy p t a little like hey help
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.240]   Help me break down the themes of this book
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.680]   And then they go and you know write something on their own based on that like we don't
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.720]   We don't know what success what's acceptable. We don't know like what counts as plagiarism or not
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.800]   I guess I think it's gonna be really confusing. Uh, do you guys have thoughts Nicholas and Anthony?
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   Yeah, I mean, I
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   Go ahead Nicholas. Oh, yeah, no, it's just feel that like chat gpt in particular
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.360]   It's just gonna be something that people will put on a resume like you just oh michasoft office skill
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.240]   It just feels like a thing that you're gonna kind of have to need to know how to use to just be
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.680]   Competitive with the person next to you or just to get your foot in the door
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:05.800]   So I do feel that I mean if I mean I get the teachers don't have the the resources to teach it
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.840]   But if I were like you said if I were student I would want to be messing with this
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.200]   I would want if I were a parent I would want my kid messing with this all the time just so that they have the experience of
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:20.120]   Using what is this potentially very important tool rather than just saying it's banned. You can't use it
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.320]   My dot the mother is a teacher calls professor
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.920]   I don't know what their chat gpt plans are
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.840]   Uh, but if if you're already talking about like banning it, I feel like the game is already over because if it's like it
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:38.920]   It's already in the ether now. It's like you're gonna have to like wrestle with the fact that this tool exists and maybe you should
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:45.480]   Uh grade test differently or maybe you should not have tests or you maybe you should like evaluate knowledge in a different way
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.720]   Then something that can be substituted for a quick little prompt, you know
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:57.080]   There you go right there. That's this that's the joint Nicholas evaluate knowledge in a different way because we've all been proven that testing is just
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.120]   Waterline useless. I mean, I I don't I don't disagree and also a homework
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.400]   I feel like my kids are my daughters for my son
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:11.320]   Just turned one and it's like I don't want them to be going to schools where like where I went to where I would be carried
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.840]   I had a 50 pound book bag filled with books. I would have hours of homework every night
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.480]   I'm like this is not I was so great
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:25.160]   I was so happy to be done with like middle school and high school because that didn't seem useful or functional at all really
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.600]   um, so yeah, I'm I'm very much alike against like busy work homework, but
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.520]   Again, I feel for teachers. I feel for teachers who weren't supported
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:40.200]   Um, you know, avid elementary is a really good show that really confronts like what public school teachers have to do with like very limited systems right now
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.800]   Um
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.880]   Asking a public high school teachers to completely reshape their the way they think of how they grade and judge kids
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:53.640]   Um because this new tech appeared six months ago. Um, not even six months ago like four months ago
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.280]   Um, it just seems like man. It seems so unfair and I don't know
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.960]   I I'd kind of don't know where we go from there with all this
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.320]   um
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.400]   also kind of part of this story about
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:13.000]   I guess the dangers of uh of generative AI and uh, we saw the story about mid-journey
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.440]   Announcing that they're ending their free trial after that partially that thing the Balenciaga Pope
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.720]   Story uh that picture went everywhere. There are also pictures of uh, donald trump getting arrested
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.080]   Which were not real which were you know generated by AI
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.280]   It is funny to me that mid-journey in a company that is you know became very famous by
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.640]   Saying hey, we have created this amazing image tool that will
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.880]   Create you know make realistic images of whatever you type into
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.800]   Um
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.760]   You know and we're going to open it up to everybody uh for free. I believe
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.520]   Um
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:53.480]   Nobody saw this coming. I don't know. Do you do do you guys feel like this was inevitable after that after mid-journey opening things up so quickly
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.920]   This one's a tough one
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.080]   And i'll tell you why
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.320]   There's no way I looked at the especially the police
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.080]   image
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.400]   And for one second thought that was a real image. Mm-hmm. I mean it didn't even take
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.680]   Uh, discerning. I have a photographer or discerning. I have a creator. I have both
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.520]   Yeah, I mean it is so obviously fake the reflections are wrong
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:27.880]   Six fingers on people's hands like I gave this like, you know walleye fish or something
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:34.360]   Uh, yeah, I don't even know how anybody for one second would have said that. I mean, listen normal people get fooled by all sorts of things
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.440]   And this is true. I yeah
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:42.680]   So to me like it is good enough. It is good enough to sway elections. It is good enough to sway the public and to me that makes it
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.040]   That's what makes this scary again. Yeah, I think we should and
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.720]   Granted the tech has to be moderated
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:57.880]   But I think this is a time for us to slow down and room and and like go back to re-educating people people need to take personal responsibility
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.360]   And maybe we have to find a way to incentivize that responsibility
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.080]   So that they can do it because
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:10.120]   Yeah, it's just it's it's I know it's a long stretch. It's I mean, yeah that it was hopeless
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.160]   That is a hopeless task when he's feeling right. Yeah, our world is getting that bad
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:21.720]   How obviously fake this is it's amazing. I mean, but I I guess I push back against that a little
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:27.960]   I mean, I think we should accept responsibly for sure and I think that there is a useful conversation to be had of like
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.680]   even before a I
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.400]   that people should look with any sort of
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:40.200]   News article or anything they see with with a degree of scappticism not because like oh, it's like the evil liberal media or whatever
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.640]   but just because
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:47.320]   any any, you know piece of content is going to be is pretty you know, at least until now produced by people and is going to be
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:53.800]   Imperfect in some ways and so you should have a little bit of that, but I think also the truth is you know, um even
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:59.240]   People like us who I you know think were more sophisticated about the news about technology and everything
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   I'm sure there are things that show up in our
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:06.680]   social media feeds that we don't examine that closely like you like I don't think anyone can sort of live in a way where they just
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:12.760]   Everything I mean and I'm somebody who's you know worked as a fact checker before like actually like doing serious fact checking that is
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.400]   A lot of work. There's like basic BS testing that you can do but in terms of like oh like
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.200]   Here's a quote that sounds kind of plausible from this person
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.120]   Let me like actually find the primary source from where this comes from or this stat or whatever
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.800]   um that act that actually is really difficult a lot of times because
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:33.720]   Especially on the internet because things start to get repeated and so figuring out where something actually came from um is
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   really hard
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:40.680]   and so I think that I and again, I maybe I don't necessarily disagree with talk that much on the
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.040]   Ultimate solution, which is I do think that as a person you have to take
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:49.960]   Responsibility, especially if you're going to act on this information whether that's buying stock how you're going to vote things like that
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.080]   um
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.960]   But at the same time, I think there have to be sort of societal
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.200]   uh solutions as well because
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.360]   You know, none of us is perfect when it comes to actually assessing these things
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.760]   Absolutely. I mean people have other things going on in their lives like that's the thing like
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   we when we focus on
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.840]   fact-checking and looking at media very very thoughtfully that is that is work that I feel like normal
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.880]   Normal citizens like don't have time for right there. They're busy taking care of picking up their kids from school
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.720]   They're busy getting dinner ready. It is a super tough thing. I'm thinking
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.600]   I live outside of Atlanta now guys. I moved from Brooklyn at the start of the pandemic and um
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.840]   I'm gonna neighbor
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:34.840]   Who is iffy on the concept of seat belts and he believes in personal responsibility for
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.600]   Keeping himself safe in the car and I just
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:43.960]   This is person's an engineer. This person is very like is you know is a programmer
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.080]   I assume like is smart on some levels, but I have to be like
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:53.960]   You know, maybe sometimes this is this is why regulation exists. This is why like I gotta protect you from yourself
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.680]   I'm sorry. I was like you have a child. This is insane. Yeah
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.160]   as an ex-parametric
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.600]   Trust me. I used to be one of those guys like I don't need to wear those things
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.760]   Yeah, but I know how to drive and after about my third or fourth bag
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.400]   I'm like, okay seat belt it is, you know, because it would a lot of people don't realize
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.320]   Maybe you get in a wreck, but when you get ejected from a car
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:23.640]   And then you hit another vehicle that hits another three other vehicles. It's not just you anymore
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:29.400]   You know what I mean? And that so yeah, this is where the personal responsibility part of it does fail
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:36.200]   See it's again. This is such a hard conversation because as a tech person this time is so epic
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:41.400]   Like what's more right now is so epic. We're back at you know printing press level days
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:50.440]   And yet interviews like how revolutionary law this stuff is. Yeah. Yeah, but the level I think of like just industrial greed
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:57.160]   Has made it that this can't grow the way it should because there's so much greed and
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.320]   everybody wants things to be the way that they want it with no understanding of
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:07.560]   A bigger society and I guess where it messes me up as I lived in Japan for a little while
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:14.200]   What the large portion of the population is never going to be everybody but over 99% in the population
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:20.600]   Will not do anything that was slightly convenient to another person. That's just their culture in general
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.440]   And that's what makes everybody fall in love with it when you go there
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.880]   Even though it is like I've talked to people who move there. They're like, oh man
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:32.760]   The garbage rules the rules of like when you put out the trash and like those sorts of things seem really like
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.920]   Stifling in a society, but if it makes everything work
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.640]   I don't know it's stifling to us because we know what the opposite looks like if you've grown up that way
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.960]   You don't even know there anything else exists
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:50.280]   And so you're cool with it and I actually didn't unlike it because you get to walk around and clean neighborhood
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.000]   Yeah, there's some hidden gems that are really
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.040]   That will look like, you know anywhere else in you know major city us
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.920]   I'm they're hidden and they're hitting no purpose because they're trying to you know show the rest of the world that is dope
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.400]   But yeah still it's just in general
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.840]   I could go
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.440]   You know from class and put my laptop on the lunchroom table
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.360]   Go back to class
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:18.680]   For two and a half more hours and come back in my seat has been successfully reserved by my laptop and nobody would touch it
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.800]   That's that's the name you lived in New York and the new york
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.440]   You could turn around to get a tissue and that's a good goal
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.320]   You know it depends it
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.160]   I feel like compassion is shown in different ways in New York and we can always have this argument
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.720]   But there is that a fun show and that flicks old enough where it's just like
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:44.040]   two-year-old kids to your kids said to do like basic shopping tasks where their parents and
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:51.000]   It's easy and they can just do it they could do it because the cars aren't zooming down the streets and people are aware of like children and
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.400]   Societies built itself in a way to take care of kids and the most vulnerable people in that society and hey, that's a beautiful thing
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.120]   um, doc to what you're saying. I feel like
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.080]   um
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.240]   The whole personal responsibility thing just seems it seems tough because it is
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.800]   Individuals right who are up against
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.560]   Everything going on in their lives and then these companies which are funded with tens of billions of dollars from the biggest
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.240]   You know technology companies in the world who want to just win this AI race
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.080]   They want to beat china, which is a thing a lot of people are thinking about
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.920]   But they also want to be the dominant one. They feel like this is the new like AI
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.000]   The new social media race or the new the new the big new tech
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.600]   And if you don't get out there fast and if you don't like cement yourself there, you're gonna miss out entirely on it
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.080]   I feel like microsoft is looking at this being like we're not gonna miss the smartphone again
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.360]   Like we're not gonna miss out on the iphone right we're we got to be here
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.560]   No matter what happens. I do feel like we're just like
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.680]   It's pedal
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:52.600]   It's it's pedal to the floor like just moving forward on it without really fully taking into account of like what it means for normal people
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.160]   And uh, i'll tell you guys my personal philosophy when I think about tech and when I write about tech
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.320]   It's like I I fight for the user right like it all comes back to tron
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.560]   It really does like
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.480]   I think about those people and what they have to do and who aren't following all this news and being like
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.120]   Well, no, these images are just coming in your social media feeds and nothing is really stopping it right?
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.640]   Unless these companies decide the tools they themselves have made
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.440]   Have to be stopped and I guess that's what mid journey did
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   Um, but yeah, we are in a strange place. Anthony, uh, nicholas any any other thoughts on this before we move on
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:31.080]   One thing I was gonna add is that as and we've all covered tech for a long time on this on this pod
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:36.120]   This definitely feels like the most exciting time in a very i would compare it to the iphone
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.680]   Uh, you know anything after the iphone
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.040]   Till this ai stuff. I mean, I don't know social, uh, uh, I
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.320]   You know, uh, story snapchat stu-
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:52.360]   Like none of this really this aisof is the most excited i've been just as a as a
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.280]   Someone interested in technology stuff and I had a conversation with
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.480]   uh
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.040]   Someone in the aiac and he definitely agreed like this he wakes up every day excited again for tech
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.200]   And he's not had that feeling in kind of kind of a long time but the crypto stuff is interesting
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.200]   Uh, the mobile stuff is interesting, but this ai stuff feel feels like this
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.760]   The most transformative thing
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.480]   Uh, he was like maybe even since like the days of like windows 95. He was just slightly older than me
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:24.600]   Uh, so this this yeah, this is this is you know, whether whether we need more personal responsibility whether we need more legislation
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.200]   You know, well, I assume I hope you know fingers crossed we'll figure it out
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.800]   Uh, but regardless this just feels like the most
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.280]   Exciting and interesting thing like I've never seen marykosov move this quickly
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.160]   Seriously, uh, yeah, a really long time, you know
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:44.920]   It's it's just wild like they they invited me to this to the event where they were gonna announce it and I was on vacation
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.160]   But they give people basically a week five days six days of heads up time to go to that event. Wow, okay
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.560]   It's pretty wild. All right. Thanks guys. We're gonna be moving on to that horrible news from elon musk in a bit
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.880]   But let's go on to an ad break from leo loport. Hey everybody. Thank you. I know i'm not here
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.600]   I'm not here just pretend i'm not here, but I did want to stop in
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.200]   If there's previously recorded commercial to tell you about uh, sisco
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:12.120]   Maraki, you know the name experts in cloud based networking for hybrid work
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:17.400]   Whether your employees are working at home at a cabin in the mountains on a lounge chair at the beach
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:24.920]   High in the air at a 787 or maybe on a cruise ship like me a cloud managed network provides the same
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.880]   Exceptional work experience no matter where they are
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.760]   And you know what you may as well roll out the welcome at hybrid work is here to stay
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.120]   So let's do it right hybrid work works best in the cloud
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:41.960]   It has its perks for both employees and yes leaders workers can move faster
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:49.880]   They can deliver better results with a cloud managed network leaders can automate distributed operations build more sustainable workplaces
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:57.160]   And maybe most importantly proactively protect the network and idg market pulse research report conducted for maraki
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:04.360]   Highlights the top tier opportunities in supporting hybrid work hybrid work is now a priority for get this
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.440]   78 of c-suite executives
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:13.080]   Leaders want to drive collaboration forward while staying on top of boosting productivity and security
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:18.760]   But we know hybrid work has its challenges the idg report also raised the red flag about
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:27.080]   Security noting that 48 of leaders reports cyber security threats as a primary obstacle to improving workforce
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.040]   Experiences, but always on security monitoring is part of what makes the cloud managed network
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.960]   So awesome. I take and use apps for maraki's vast ecosystem of partners turn key solutions
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:43.640]   Built to work seamlessly with a maraki cloud platform for asset tracking location analysis
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:49.080]   And more to gather insights on how people use their work spaces for instance in a smart space
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:55.160]   Environmental sensors can be used to to track activity and occupancy levels to stay on top of cleanliness
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:01.160]   They also help with hot-desking right you can reserve work spaces based on vacancy and employee profiles
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.920]   It also makes it easy for employees to scout out a spot in a snap reserve it and have it ready for them when they arrive
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:15.400]   And if you have a location and restricted environments, it's going to really help your security with advanced booking time based door access things like that
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:24.120]   Uh when it comes to mobile device management maraki's got you covered too with integrating devices and systems that allow it to manage update and troubleshoot company
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.640]   Own devices even when the device and the employee are
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.600]   Oh, let's say on a cruise ship
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:38.040]   For instance turn any space into a place of productivity and empower your organization with the same exceptional experience
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:46.600]   No matter where they work with maraki and the sisco suite of technology learn how your organization can make hybrid work work
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.240]   Visit maraki.cisco.com/twit
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:59.000]   I gotta go because the shuffleboard tournament's about to begin, but you should go to maraki.cisco.com/twit
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.440]   We thank them so much for supporting this week in tech and don't forget your support is just as important
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:10.280]   You gotta go to that site so they know you saw it here maraki.cisco.com/twit
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.320]   Now back to the show
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.000]   You know what let's uh, let's go on to that terrible elumus views
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.440]   Which I feel like we just got to check in on every week and see what the heck is going on with twitter
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.560]   Um, there was a great piece by eena free to over at uh at axios
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.640]   Just pointing out that you know
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   elumusque twitter is not really about free speech the guy who wanted to buy this company and always talked about like
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:41.160]   Man twitter is so biased again towards liberals. Um and was really proposing more free speech. Uh, it's not really
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   Not really living up to that label. I guess um his his twitter is more restrictive than ever
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:53.160]   There is the way he's pushing verification. Um, basically getting ready to strip it from people
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.400]   We're we're all kind of in the weird space right now, right because they announced that uh
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.600]   Legacy blue checks are going to be losing their checks eventually
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.400]   That was supposed to be able first that didn't happen
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   There was a report that uh, this is actually a very manual process that twitter has to do
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:14.360]   So like so many things elumusque talks about it is much harder to actually do in practice and uh, then just like flipping a switch
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:20.680]   Um, so yeah, we've seen several uh major accounts like the new york times
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.040]   Say that they're not going to be paying for the be much higher
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:29.080]   $1,000 monthly fee to keep their blue checks so the new york times that they wouldn't do that they lost their check mark
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:34.760]   Um entirely and that's a weird retaliatory move. We've also seen celebrities like labron james
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:40.600]   Um, you know other other organizations washing to post the la times have all said that they're not going to pay for this
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.680]   Seems like this is all kind of backfiring for twitter and elon musk like what are you are you guys worried about?
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:52.440]   I I assume most of you guys have blue checks are you worried about this or you just like think this is uh
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:56.440]   Is this a weird place that we've seen twitter fall to things that elon musk
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   Honestly, it just feels funny at this point. I'm like, yeah, watch watch it go down. Uh, take my blue check mark, please
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.120]   Please
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.920]   I just feel like at this point. It's just pure keystone cops
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   Have you guys noticed right so?
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.720]   New york times their check is completely gone right
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:23.000]   New york times books arts, chinese cooking and food health photos, new york times world science new york times travel
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.480]   I still got checks. I mean that's too much work. It's too much work doc. It's silly. It's super silly. It's yeah
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.560]   I'm with Anthony 100%
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.960]   It is it's funny necklace any broad thoughts before we like dive deeper into this
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.680]   My broader thoughts are I moved to tusan areas about about three months ago
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.760]   I
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:47.480]   Have more important things to do with my life than worried about whether or not my blue check is
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.800]   There or not. I loved I think it was thursday or friday
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:57.400]   The twitter verified account was like manually unfollowing people it had followed and it was like
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.800]   Certain folks were reacting like it was a like a five alarm fire or whatever
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.520]   And I was like I opened my door and I looked at mount lemon and I was like i'm gonna go hike that tomorrow
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.000]   That's what's important to me. That sounds good
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.040]   So I does I I'm kind of joking
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:17.480]   But I do think that this site has like if twitter if elon were like truly benevolent
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:23.320]   He would just shut it down at this point and like free us from this insanity because we're all very smart
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.400]   Like it is taking up so much
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:31.640]   Like of our brain collective brain. It is it is bad like how he's infested our brains. What's up? Yeah
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.040]   Yeah, I would also say that in just in terms of the big picture like
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.480]   generally people there there is this sort of like
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:45.480]   Hobby horse, uh, particularly people on the right who like like to bang the drum about free speech and I think there are
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.640]   genuinely very difficult and thorny questions about how
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.880]   Speech is moderated online how it's moderated on social platforms
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:49:01.000]   Generally the people who are shouting about free speech have no interest in any of those questions and elon musk is just a perfect example of that that like
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.840]   Again, I think there's all kinds of difficult questions about how you would moderate speech on twitter
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:11.000]   He is no interest in that he's just you know, whatever his pet
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Thing is at the moment. That's what you know all the remaining engineers at twitter have to work on rather than
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.880]   Like real serious policy
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:27.320]   Who do you guys think they're there at some point somebody's gonna dramatize like this the fall of twitter and like elon must like this whole thing
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:33.080]   Hopefully in a limited series and not a movie because I feel like the story is too wild and expansive who should play elon musk
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:40.760]   That is a lot done been on my mind lately. That is good. You know after um social network was so good. It was very good
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.520]   Um
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:48.040]   Right that's the order of HBO right? I'm mixing. No, well, sorry. So you're thinking about the con valley. Yeah, the con valley
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.640]   That's what I mean. That was so good. It was so well done
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:57.800]   I would love to see them come back now with all the craziness that's going on in tech
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.280]   But who could play you on?
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:05.560]   I'll just just just struck me. I know is um is will ferrell
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.040]   I think let's
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:13.800]   Oh, you want to go you want to go comedic. I'm not even saying go comedic. I'm just saying this thing is hilarious
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.000]   Everything elon musk does now he is a comedy
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.560]   So like will ferrell in like, you know, he has done a few serious movies
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.080]   But like will ferrell would sort of like be able to tap into the like
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:30.040]   Uh insane brain that the elon musk is dealing with right now because i'm gonna go june law
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:33.960]   And take it back to a no, that's too too. E too nice too nice to elon musk
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:34.600]   No, sir
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:39.560]   Like steve carrell would be interesting because he's kind of especially the character from the office where he's just kind of like
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.760]   The only one laughing at his own jokes and you're just kind of like well
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.600]   He's the boss. I guess we gotta have to oh that would be interesting
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.840]   I'm gonna say german strong is
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.040]   Oh gee office. You got to get reiki. Oh, yeah, okay
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.960]   That would be good actually
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.760]   Our good your face would be good any any of the cringe people but honestly german strong from succession who is yeah
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.960]   Who has done a good job of also living the cringe life apparently?
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.640]   um
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:10.120]   I that's a good one. That's a good one. I think but I do feel like people would tune in for the uh, the elon musk the twitter files
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.560]   Um, you know limited series starring will ferrell
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.040]   I think people would tune it just to be like what what is this? Should I should I watch this? I don't know?
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.800]   um
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:24.280]   So twitter did something else too. They, uh, open sourced a part of their algorithm
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.200]   Which is something elon musk was also complaining about for a while and turns out
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:34.040]   It's not actually much of it. Uh, the open source part of the algorithm that was used for the uh for you tab
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:40.840]   So that's like their recommendation algorithm. Uh, we've seen a couple revelations from this but not not actually much right?
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.120]   um
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:48.440]   There was the some people noticed that there were specific groups for democrats and republicans to kind of sort people into that
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.280]   elon musk apparently had his own like specific category
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.880]   Um
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:59.240]   So those those specific things uh, he didn't know why that was there and he was sort of like questioning this in real time
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:03.400]   Uh, but chris subell over in gajut wrote a good piece. Um, just kind of compiling things
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:09.320]   Trying to figure out like what we actually learned from this turns out not much turns out like a lot of the the open source code out there
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:15.800]   Um is a very small part of what twitter does doesn't actually like give us a full look at the company and it's all
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:22.600]   Like yeah, it's a whole lot of nothing like so much for me elon musk's mouth these days like it is the thing he clamored for and
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:29.400]   Doesn't actually give us much details. I did have you guys looked at this or like the revelations from the open sourcing of the code
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:33.480]   I just thought a little bit and it was interesting that uh,
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:41.480]   For that links were kind of you would be ding for having a link in there, uh, you know replies and count as much as retweets or likes
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.200]   So that was I mean that was kind of interesting, but I think you know again
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:50.360]   This was in media have known forever basically that twitter. Yeah, it's not a super great driver of traffic
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:54.360]   I mean facebook was back in the day. Uh, I don't know about nowadays as much
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.080]   Uh, but like twitter was never twitter is basically just like
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:01.560]   I mean, it's it's a i mean, it's weird now, but like it was never traffic driver
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:07.720]   Uh, so it doesn't it doesn't uh, I'm always treated as just like side-field gifts and like sports rumors and stuff
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.240]   a very like very casual approach to twitter
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:16.840]   Uh, but yeah, the actual open source for i mean, I guess he said he was gonna do it and he did it kind of
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.800]   He did part of it. Yeah, I mean, that's star. I guess a gold star there
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:30.840]   Uh, we also saw that the twitter is down ranking posts are related to the ukraine crisis. So that's like a whole other thing
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:36.120]   Um, although it seemed like actually that might be specifically twitter spaces twitter space is yes
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.720]   But again, again, it's like very confusing and it's not totally clear what it means
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:46.200]   The why of it is all very confusing. Yeah, and I'm also still shocked that twitter spaces are still up and running because I feel like that's a very
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:52.760]   Complex part of the company and we're waiting for pieces to fall off of twitter and people are still hosting spaces and it seems to be going fine
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:59.000]   I guess yeah, there was something else. Did you guys notice the doge the doge on twitter this week?
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.960]   I will say as much as I like to complain about you on must twitter. I thought that was fun
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.880]   That was you know what like it was cute. It brought us miles my face. I mean listen don't
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:11.240]   I feel like he's ruining shiba news for all of us, but uh
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:15.560]   It is one of those things like oh this guy this guy just he can just he owns twitter
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:21.720]   He could just do this he could just put the dogecoin dog that he's also he's been pumping doge for a while
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.720]   And he's being sued by people around that
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:28.040]   Um, but he could just put the dogecoin dog up on twitter and we'll have to live with that
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   I
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.080]   Mean I think overall it's just like all this stuff is a reminder that um
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.200]   This is the twitter is now like
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.680]   Controlling you know this weird pet incredibly expensive pet project
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:47.800]   Owned by this one guy and it's just gonna be whatever his weird preferences are that's what's gonna happen
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.720]   and um
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:55.080]   I you know it does act as in like some interesting if not particularly revelatory things come out of the open sourcing but
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:01.080]   Even when he makes gestures for the fundamentally, this is his pet project like don't think of it as anything but that
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:06.040]   Yeah, which I don't know if we fully if twit has fully had like a uldg for twitter
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:10.680]   But I mean for me personally like it was a super useful tool for for many many years
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.400]   Like it was my favorite social media platform for a reason
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:19.480]   And uh, I don't know if you guys have seen this but there are a lot of media twitter a lot of like other reporters have been doing
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:23.880]   We're doing spaces like early on when twitter took over ownership of like oh my god
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:28.120]   It's all falling apart and isn't this really sad and a lot of it was very navelgezy
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.200]   But also like yeah twitter
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:37.480]   Twitter played a very big role in my life in my career and it it really does stink to see it being like turned into this tool
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:42.600]   You know for a billionaire who has no idea what to do with it other than troll people with doze coin picture
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.160]   So that's that's funny. I guess I don't know
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:50.360]   I just I will say on the other side of that. I I still see plenty of people just using twitter as if nothing happened
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:53.720]   Yeah, you're spanish still see plenty of support is just tweeting their scoops
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.520]   Uh, you know guys talking about what happened last night in the game
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:02.840]   Uh, so there still appears to be plenty of like ordinary use of twitter and notwithstanding a lot of the folks
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:06.360]   Uh getting upset over whatever elan does this week. It's you know
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.920]   Uh who's to say what happens in the future time?
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:14.360]   Well, tell I guess but I still still see like a critical pass of kind of like normal usage so to speak
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.760]   Uh and to me that's kind of like that would be the canary if like if those guys stop
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:24.200]   Tweeting if those guys stop talking about the the bad ref call or things like that if that goes away
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.760]   Then i'll be like, okay, maybe twitter is dying
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.320]   But for now I still see a lot of that
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:36.280]   I'm saying like a lot of many people moving over to mastodon and I I'm kind of splitting my time and trying to like spend more time on naston
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.000]   But
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.920]   It is one of those things where it's like a lot of the voices I really liked in twitter just not there anymore
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.040]   So
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.280]   It's it's starting to feel a more and more of a ghost town, but i'm sure specific niches like sports
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:50.040]   Yeah, all the sports people are probably still using it just fine right now. I feel like mr
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:56.440]   Don is heavy tech because we got it right away with I've never even made mine yet because I was like no twitter is going to make it
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.280]   It'll be I
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:03.080]   No, it's not. Oh god. I call that one wrong. So it's still good. It's still good
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:07.880]   Yeah, but i'm with you like I missed the part where twitter, you know was good
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:13.080]   It was a good place to you know to share your stories and you know connect with companies and apps and things like that and
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.760]   Now yes, it's it's a little bit, you know psycho
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:24.200]   But I still use it just because like if you're not calling your own shots on twitter somebody else might call them for you
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:30.520]   So, but I don't put the effort and time I used to in it because it's just not going to the outcome is not going to be there
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.160]   So yeah, it is a very strange place
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:37.240]   But it's almost like one of those things if you ignore it long enough
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.400]   You go to pick those up to put them in the large and you're like, whoa, what did I do?
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:46.680]   What that over there again, right? Yeah, you gotta do that. You can't what kind of fun just grew on this thing
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.840]   It's better well and uh
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:54.040]   It is fun gear every every week and it makes me sad because it hey
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:59.000]   I was I started in like 2008 I started movie podcasts like way back then and thanks to twitter
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:57:59.560]   I was you know
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:05.640]   We were able to get bring on directors and guests and film critics and like that was a big part of like how my podcast grew
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.880]   This is a part this big part of like how media people kind of evolved and uh
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:16.680]   Worked over the last decade or more actually 15 years now. So I think twitter helped make regular people
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:21.640]   Start paying attention to the tech space a little more, you know before it was just us right?
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.480]   We were all kind of started talking to each other right um and then
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:29.080]   Around the time of like
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:35.800]   Right when we were starting to slow down and we were getting closed right when we basically involved to
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.600]   Engage it completely
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:42.280]   Um and that was about the time that the general public was starting to come in
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.960]   Which is I part of the reason why I think a well made the decision to shut down twine
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:51.160]   Like stick us all together was because more people were going to come in and they weren't going to go to two sites
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:57.880]   Because the phone was getting big enough that it wasn't a max site in a pc site and then a random phone site
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:03.080]   It was like everybody in retrospect was probably not not the best decision. They will be like a lot of
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.880]   Yeah
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.880]   That's a whole separate episode
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:15.400]   Yep, yeah, but I think that was really at the time that I started to hear some of my regular friends
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:21.080]   Like you know talk about oh, I heard this on you know in gadget. I heard this on the virgin
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.760]   We didn't know about engaging or the birds or you know back then gives motor or whatever
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:29.720]   And it was that um, what was it the iPhone 4 asked the one that got away in the bar
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.600]   And that's when normal people started playing. I think for yeah, yeah iPhone 4. Okay. That was ruined
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.600]   I think regular people started paying attention
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.120]   And it kind of grew from there and then I agree with you now
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:45.320]   It's very sad to what it is now. It's like seeing one of your friends from high school. That's just exactly
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.720]   Look at the facebook is like oh no, you followed far. This is very sad
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:52.680]   Though again to be fair to elan who again
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:57.960]   I think is doing a terrible job and in his ruining twitter in a lot of ways twitter was having a lot of trouble for that and twitter
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:04.440]   Was a lot less fun for me even before elan bought it some of that is just you know, I'm yeah
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.680]   40 now I was 25 when I got on
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:14.520]   On twitter like the amount of time i have the glorious days of our 20s and yeah to just like say dumb stuff online is is less
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.800]   Um, but I think there were also, you know when twitter became a public company and there was like pressure to grow it
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:28.520]   And then they're like just cycling through all these different things that will save twitter whether it was spaces or video or all these things
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.280]   you know, it was
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.160]   It was clearly something they were struggling and that was why elan was able to buy them
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.240]   So it's not like it was great elan
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.160]   Yeah bought it and then that's what destroyed it was that but you i'm buying it
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.600]   It's a whole company yeah
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.800]   Or you like that was just the next step in this like death spiral or whatever
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:52.440]   I am mad at everybody like the twitter leadership at the time and and jacked or see to you like the the people who were like quick to cash out
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   Because twitter was kind of flailing and elan was just like hey i'm gonna overpay for this thing
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.000]   Um, you know, yeah
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   And remember the thing that's really hilarious to me
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.520]   And I remember that twitter sued to force elan to buy it
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.080]   Yeah, it wasn't like elan wanted to back out
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.520]   Yeah, whether he did or whether he was just a good go-shitting tactic to lower the price
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.120]   I don't know but like it there was a period where he was like i'm gonna walk away and she was like no
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.680]   No, no text these things. Yeah
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.400]   Oh man, that was
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.080]   We are truly living in the dumbest timeline
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.960]   I feel like whenever we talk about twitter and elan must be used like it's just a reminder the reminder of that it is
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:32.040]   It's not great. You know who we don't talk about very much these days is is meta. Remember meta?
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.840]   Release the metaverse
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.120]   Trying to think of like much news. It's been happening around meta these days
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:43.000]   And I guess it's like one good thing about twitter kind of soaking up a lot of the social media controversy side of things
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.960]   but
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.720]   I mean there were a couple stories we're looking at like meta is potentially considering a political ad ban in the EU
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.200]   because of new regulations coming up there
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.280]   um
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:02:02.280]   There's news analysis showing like um, hey people are benefiting quite a bit from twitter except uh, I believe the news showed that um
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:08.200]   Links uh new posts with news links get less than 3% of facebook use
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:12.120]   So it is funny about this post that they put out there showing like how useful
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:18.520]   Facebook is meta is for you know for actual news sources and their actual news spreading
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.400]   Is not actually true anymore. I feel like it was a lot more
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.120]   um, and there was a story earlier this uh
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.480]   this month
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:33.000]   uh about clear view AI um admitting that scraped 30 billion images from facebook and other social media sites to give them the cops and
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.280]   Remember clear view AI. That's the company those working on, uh, you know facial recognition software they licensed it to police and um
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.800]   We're kind of all uh on a basically perpetual police lineup thanks to this company. So
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.360]   That's that that's the meta report
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.160]   I don't know if you guys have any feelings about like where meta is or where it could be going because it does seem like
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.560]   Nobody's talking about the metaverse anymore thanks to AI
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.600]   I think meta
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.600]   how that reminds me of
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   uh loony tunes where
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.320]   Pick your random character
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.800]   Had both hands and both feet blocked in the water coming through the wall
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:15.960]   And then another water would break through the wall and they like they got a move in there all of a sudden just juggling really fast
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.240]   I think after their initial debacle
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:25.720]   They've been doing that the entire time and there's not enough hands to block all the holes in the wall
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:35.880]   They had the perfect opportunity when elon started just messing up twitter to come in and be like remember us we're sorry
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.720]   Uh, we'll take you back. We went and fixed everything. We're going to be better
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   And they kind of hose that too. It was working for a minute
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:48.280]   But they just couldn't manage to like, you know, just be right
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.800]   So in a way, I'm going to talk about a person
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.680]   Who kind of fits the personality of facebook and they stole his name
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.320]   meta world peace
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:05.960]   Hands down one of the best defenders ever in a game one of the best ballers in the game
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.800]   But he could never just behave and do right
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.120]   And if he could just get out of his own way and behave and do right
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:20.440]   He'd be definitely top five, you know, dead or alive, but he could not do right. I feel like meta
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.480]   Experience he should have sued them for stealing his name
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.320]   But then there was another company called meta before there was
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.880]   Yeah
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.880]   Had said or ar heads at the time
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:38.680]   But they're living up to mr. Arts is there in like as a company if rudder test was a company it'd be facebook
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.280]   It is there there is probably like some sort of like weird
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.720]   Like dark comedy to make about like social media over the past five years too because so much of it was
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.880]   Facebook basically chasing everybody right like copying snapchat copying
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:59.240]   Copying twitter whenever they could too pretty brunch everybody like you had to bring in all the new features to instagram
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:05.880]   Facebook seems so desperate for so long and then the whole metaverse thing was just like zuckerberg like putting his foot down being like
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.640]   This is the future
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:15.400]   And I don't have you guys spent any time in in the metaverse doing metaverse meetings or doing like the the meta demos that have been out there
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.680]   I I played horizon worlds around christmas time. Yeah. Yeah, I wait
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:27.320]   I mean it wasn't for me and i'm a huge gamer like I love I played lord knows in an order in a matter of world of warcraft and
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:30.840]   And like so i'm like prime to like enjoy online communities
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:36.520]   And it was just kind of boring and the graphics were bad. I was like, why about why about I play with this?
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.640]   There's no there's no compelling reason to be here actually
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.280]   Uh, so I don't it's so funny that like every you know
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.360]   Facebook meta is
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:49.480]   Is talking about the metaverse and then and then all of a sudden everyone's talking about AI and they're like, uh, oh, no
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.320]   Yeah, it just kind of like the ground shit completely underneath them
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:59.800]   Uh, and no one yeah, I don't I don't see a whole lot of consumed like regular. I mean i'm at consumer reports
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:05.240]   I don't know that I see a whole lot of everyday consumer interest in like vr stuff or like the metaverse
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.240]   Uh, I will say that I I do see a lot of activity
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.480]   I mean facebook marketplace is I I think basically replaced craigslist
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:19.720]   Uh from there. Yeah, you know people use the groups for like, you know, again, I just moved I still I see people use
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:24.040]   Facebook groups to talk about Arizona and stuff going on restaurant recommendations
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.800]   So that does appear to be like a lot of folks like active on the less
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:34.360]   Exciting aspects of fate. It just kind of feels like a decent social network, right? Like yeah, yes
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:39.080]   You can find most people there you can find your high school friends there or the people you hate in high school
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.040]   So
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.720]   I yeah, the the push away from it just seemed funny. So I did
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.280]   Uh over in gajai i've covered horizon worlds. I covered like the virtual meeting stuff
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:53.960]   And it was kind of cool, but I will tell you guys like what I did one of those things in zuckerberg like piped in in his little
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:59.720]   Uh his little metaverse avatar and he was sitting right next to my little avatar
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.440]   Oh, it was a weird thing of like, oh, am I
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.720]   Sitting next to my soccerberg. Is this weird?
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:11.960]   Is this it is weird because like if I if I turn my head and I was wearing the oculus quest too
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:16.920]   It would be my avatar staring at him. It's like, oh, that's that's bad. That's that's not good. You shouldn't do that
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.160]   That's that's you know socially not great
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.960]   So I was like trying not to hold the controllers badly too
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.800]   So my arms weren't doing weird things
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.960]   And if you go look at footage from that which is some of that is in the engager piece and then other
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:32.520]   Tights pieces because they got like recorded footage. My hands are just doing like crazy gymnast motions
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.800]   Because the meta quest hand tracking is so bad
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.880]   Like earthly see motion tracking
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.360]   Didn't understand what I was trying to do when I put the controllers down
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.520]   It was it like lost tracking and just went crazy
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:47.560]   So, you know that was his time to show off like what you could do with meta metaverse meetings
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.960]   And it is cool. I actually do like taking meetings in the metaverse, but it is
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.800]   Nobody's gonna buy VR headsets just for that, you know, it's kind of a weird thing
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.160]   But we're we're also all waiting for apple to talk about their thing, right?
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:05.160]   So is the metaverse completely dead? I know are you guys anticipating like whatever apple is gonna debut at dub dub?
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.400]   as a die hard apple person I have both
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:17.240]   Issue not issue. I have reservations about it and yet i'm interested to see what the way that we do right
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.680]   I'm an ex-appling play. I should just say that right away. Oh, wow. Okay. Um,
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:27.480]   But one of the things to me that even during the AI conversation, I'm like yo apple has been like
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.560]   Completely hiding from the AI conversation
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:38.680]   And I feel like when they decide to come in they're gonna kick in the door waving the four four
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.000]   Like biggie. I don't know how I don't know why but whatever they do
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.720]   It's gonna be like a super seer. It's gonna be super powered. Siri. That's what it has to be right like gpt
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:53.480]   Five level smarts and like the smartest thing in the world. That's the only way apple could make it good because he
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.720]   Right or they'll just stay out of it completely. You can't you can't do that
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:05.240]   Exactly. So this is where i'm going to end and the other thing to say with the with you know, we've been talking about apples a our
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:12.760]   Head sense for I feel like uh-huh you remember when uh, well, who's at mentee quo would always talk about apple tv
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:18.600]   Like we're gonna get a physical, you know tv like the one back there. It's gonna have apple tv built in
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.480]   Uh, yo mc is still not out yet. So
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:29.640]   I'm sure they tested it like I'm sure apple played with this. Yeah, I can't I can neither. Um, what is that agree or
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:35.160]   It's not i can't speak on that but um, yes, it is definitely
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:40.760]   Interesting to see but already the rumor mill is like oh, it's gonna be three thousand dollars
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:47.160]   It's like you're not gonna come out with a three thousand dollar head set if the competition is 200
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:50.360]   That's a part gap if that if that's the market, right?
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.720]   And it's like it
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.400]   It's it's interesting like because I feel like meta is playing one game and apple's like, okay
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.480]   Where where where is this market can be in five years?
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.400]   You know, how do we prepare for that?
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.240]   And it's like a three thousand per a three thousand dollar pair of like
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:08.440]   VR or augmented reality glasses that are good for developers because how much does a mac pro cost?
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.760]   You know, like a mac pro starts at
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.240]   Five thousand plus, you know, like that is pro grade hardware and not meant for everybody
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.400]   Um, i'm equal to apple pricing all the time. Uh, there is the studio monitor
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.800]   I yell at you every time the studio monitor with the one thousand dollar stand
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.480]   Are you kidding me?
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.000]   Okay, I'll tell you what yeah, this is funny. I was playing this i was playing this place
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.480]   Finally so people can let it go. Uh-huh. Do you know who builds the bougie?
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.880]   No
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:39.560]   Volkswagen uh-huh they build the viron as
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:45.800]   a proof of concept to get all the research and development and the people that have the money to buy that
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:50.280]   Basically pay for the rnd they pay for the proof of concept
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.400]   And then now they could take that and bring it back
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.400]   Nissan builds some of the dopas gtp cars in the planet
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:03.160]   So that your nissan that you have to carry your children's around and has amazing anti-lock breaking system
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.400]   That was invented at my college in japan i was with the kids
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:13.240]   I was in the class but i used to stalk them because i thought it was so cool that they were building gtp car in the middle of a university
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.560]   But a lot of that technology has made it down
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.520]   So those those crazy products that everyone loves to make fun of are twofold
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.160]   That's the proof of concept so that you can get it down to an everyday person
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.440]   That's the vr headset you're saying or the a-the mess if they come out with a three thousand dollar vr
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:34.200]   Head sag it's going to be built for those of us bleeding edges to pay for it
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:42.200]   And then they'll whittle it down to where the general people can get at it and then yeah not so crazy anymore the tech is also
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:49.000]   Sorry, the reason why the air mass watch existed is so that we could get ultra today
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.920]   It's higher than the others and it's a very particular crowd i disagree but
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:00.920]   Okay, but also celebrities were really starting to jump on to the apple train so it was a good play
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:05.320]   It wasn't intended for any of us to go and buy air mass or a gold edition
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:11.320]   It was intended for biancé and jz and everybody who bought gold editions or air mass edition
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.160]   Yeah, I mean it didn't hurt apple to do those things but those those were vanity products
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.960]   Right like that the the urn mass apple watch was functionally no better than the the intro no not at all
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:25.320]   But it proved that somebody would pay for so i believe the function was it proved that certain people will pay more
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.480]   If it hits a switch and I think that's what I meant by the the audio yeah
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.320]   I feel like it's the push on phones like the iphone pro getting too close to
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.120]   $1,500 in many configurations where it's like
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:41.960]   Yeah phones aren't just 500 bucks anymore, right? So it's like I feel like apple has seen like people just want to pay for that
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:46.760]   Um, I mean doc. I thought you were gonna try to excuse $1,000 monitor stand
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:52.760]   No, it's no it's there for it's there to get an idea of
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:59.320]   You know the kind of people that play now also you have to remember every company every store everywhere somewhere has a product
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.160]   This is kind of like crazy, right?
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.040]   Remember the serendipity like $1,000 dessert
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.960]   Like it exists because that's what gets people to talk about your restaurant
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.320]   Right
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:15.160]   The tv places the the production houses that will actually buy those they don't care because it's all
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:20.200]   Bunch they have marms to mount those monitors on yeah, right you know i'm saying so they'll they'll spend
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:24.360]   Money on stuff like that because it's just part of the budget, you know, it is it is
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.000]   I mean it was silly. It's one of those things where i'm like I can't
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.040]   I can't like give apple praise for certain things that they do like I think some things can be you know cheaper like I
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.520]   Think the iphone sc is a good play. I think like a lot of you know
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.200]   There are a lot of things that can be great plays and inexpensive and good deals
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:48.680]   But then we see things like that monitor stand that still it still makes me so angry doc. I'm so mad at it
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:54.120]   But okay, okay. I don't think the metaverse is dead yet, but it's certainly like whatever meta was trying to get at
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.480]   Uh probably it's not gonna be coming anytime soon, but uh, yeah
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.800]   We'll stay tuned folks like we're gonna be keeping an eye on like the apple stuff or whatever is there honestly
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.160]   I haven't good. I hope i'm gonna get to go to dub dub and check this thing out in person
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.000]   But we will be right back. Let's move on to another ad from leo
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.920]   Let me uh fight. Can I just hello everybody leo here? I know i'm not here
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.920]   But I am here right now
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.760]   To tell you about our sponsor for this episode of this week in tech zip recruiting
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:26.040]   They want me to do that because we use zip recruiter and I know intimately how great zip recruiter is whether you're starting a new business
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.560]   Whether you're growing a business if you want to be successful
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.680]   You need the most talented people on your team
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:37.960]   Accompanies made of the people you hire and that's where zip recruiter comes in right now
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:41.080]   You can try it free zip recruiter.com/twit
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.080]   Uh, we don't have openings very often here, but when we do it's always a crisis, right?
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:51.160]   Oh, no, we gotta work extra hours to fill in the the whole it's gonna take us forever to find a great employee, right?
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.560]   And lee so we'll go I could I can tell you it's happened many times at breakfast. She'll say oh no
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:00.040]   This happened when ashley quit from continuity. She got a better job closer to home, right?
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.480]   So we love her but she gave us two weeks notice that was nice
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.480]   But two weeks is pretty quick to find a replacement for somebody as great as ashley, right?
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:12.360]   So lisa that morning goes to zip recruiter.com/twit
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:16.200]   Types in the job opening immediately with a click of a mouse
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:22.520]   That job opening goes to more than a hundred other job boards plus social networks reaches out the widest net
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.720]   And then the thing we loved about zip recruiter is she's not gonna get phone calls her inbox is not gonna get flooded
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:32.680]   It all goes into the zip recruiter interface where it's very easy to screen out people you can have
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:39.480]   Uh, yes, no questions multiple choice even essay questions automatically screen out people who don't have the right qualifications
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.160]   You can reform out all of the resumes was very easy to scan them
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:48.440]   And and and it makes it very easy to rank all your candidates and pick the right one fast
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:53.000]   But but I have to say zip recruiter does one more thing. That's really miraculous
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:59.080]   Zip recruiter has millions of resumes on fox people come to zip recruiter looking for work, right?
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.640]   So they scan through those
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:08.040]   Looking for candidates that match the qualifications your requirements for the job you've got opening and then
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.520]   They'll find those candidates and send them to you and say here
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:16.280]   Here are some people we think would match you look at the resumes and you invite the people you want
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:22.680]   Now I have to tell you when you invite somebody to to apply for your job. That's like the golden ticket
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.080]   I mean they are so happy to be invited. They show up. They do the interviews all of that stuff
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.920]   It's a really great way to begin that process
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.800]   and then of course
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.080]   You get a wonderful person and we did
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.120]   That's how we met viva who replaced ashley and it's wonderful. Thank you zip recruiter

[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:51.640]   So I hope he's having some good food over wherever he is in europe right now. I've lost track of Leo
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:55.480]   I think he was on a ship at some point. So hopefully Leo is having a good time
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:01.320]   But we've still got some news to talk about here. We got a great panel to Nicholas daily on from consumer reports
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.440]   Doc rock youtube master Anthony han from any ac ventures. What's up everybody? How are you guys doing?
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:11.080]   We are we're at the tail end of the show. Um, I know at least one of you is a first-timer here
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.960]   I hope everyone's good got your new stamina up
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:22.040]   Let's move on to some news from google because google is uh again not not as much in the news as some of these other companies
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:25.560]   How many files do you guys think you have in your google drive?
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.800]   Do you have five million? Do you have over over five million files in your google drive down?
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.680]   Feels like a lot, but it seems like a lot
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.320]   I mean google drive has been around for a long time
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:42.120]   I think people on reddit and google zone support site like we're noticing
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:48.920]   That they just couldn't add a certain amount of files anymore. Uh google has announced that they've reduced that or removed that limit entirely
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.360]   Um
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.600]   Just a really interesting thing to think about like given how long google drive has been there
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:59.160]   I how do you guys have you guys been using google drive and gmail like a since they've been out?
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.320]   Yes, yeah, I remember in the launch and being very excited to be
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:10.440]   Right, so you remember back when you had to get like invites from somebody and then people were selling them one
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:16.920]   I spent five dollars on ebay for gmail invite. So that is how I got it. So funny. I got my first google
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.880]   I mean I got my gmail invite from kevin rose
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.600]   And at that time like I was just you know in the chat first like, you know
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:30.840]   He's like guys we got five to give away and they're doing like a show. It wasn't even live. It was like we were so excited for gmail
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:38.360]   Oh my god, it's changed the world. I remember being so furious at whatever google employee was also named Anthony
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:43.800]   Ha because he had claimed Anthony Ha at gmail.com. So I couldn't do it, which was i'm still angry about
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:48.280]   I'm sorry. Maybe when they you will be able to chase him down and reclaim that email address. I don't know
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.400]   I'll give you wherever you are. I'll give you five dollars for it. Yeah, Anthony. Huh out there
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:59.400]   You guys remember to the thing that made gmail amazing was you got 25
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:04.920]   Yigs of space was it 25? Where's it like? I think you might have been like it was too action
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.840]   You're correct. You're correct. This was like 2005 2006
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.480]   I was out of college and working in it and like it was perfect time to be like oh
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:19.720]   This this is cool as hell because I can talk to people about this like uh, also the idea of like web based email
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:23.960]   Was was still a little like fresh and new right because all we had was hotmail
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:32.120]   And a couple of i-map was still yeah, it wasn't new but as far as being used by a majority of the population
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:37.400]   Uh actually wasn't even the majority was the beginning of it was like we were using i-map
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:42.280]   Other people were still on pop and wonder why why do I tell my email here and it's missing here
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:47.880]   Acronym's back to me doc like the things I used to have to set up like oh why why do you want i-map over pop three
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.960]   And uh, what about my exchange server? How do you connect all those things together?
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:21:00.280]   Uh, man, it is wild to think and now i know i know i know gmail launched in 2004 and it was one gigabyte and it was april first
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.640]   I remember reading the slash dot dot dot stories still live
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:09.000]   So i remember reading this when I was I guess I was technically still in high school when i'm once but everyone was like a gigabyte
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.120]   This is obvious a bike was that real was that the private launch because for some reason I have two gigabytes embedded in my in my
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.960]   Burnt yeah, I have to get my
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:23.720]   My name is your first announced yet. I don't know the the private public. Yeah, it was and there was some data forever
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.520]   But man that was just that that that like changed the world right and like after gmail
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.760]   I just stopped configuring email clients all together right like a I guess post
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.880]   2008 like when I left it and when I moved to New York
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.040]   If you're just using gmail for email, why would you configure that and you're like that stop client?
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.520]   Just just go to the website. Yeah found it. She's here
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.080]   April first
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:50.760]   2005 yes increased it to two gigabytes by one Carlos beres
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:54.280]   He wrote this article because that bananas people
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:57.000]   Absolutely, but that is
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.200]   And you remember at that time if you were a mac user
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:07.880]   If your yudora or outlook database right because we had the pst file if it got to around two gigs
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.240]   It started to get really like messed up and wouldn't really work
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:16.600]   Right and so it was a big deal that you had two gigabytes and it would actually work
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:20.600]   Oh, man. This is yeah and the idea in google drive just seemed like this limitless
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:25.080]   Limitless storage box for you to like share whatever you want a legal stuff illegal stuff
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.160]   I'm not gonna I'm not gonna judge
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:32.680]   See that does point out that google was kind of unique compared to one drive drop box and other sites
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.800]   Like they they actually had a file number limit
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:42.680]   Which was like irrespective of your whatever storage you were paying for so that limit when uh that limit
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.240]   They started rolling out a drive limit in february
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:50.360]   I think that's when people started uh, no de-sing this restriction just a weird thing and it seems like
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:55.160]   You're google you're worried about people having too many small files in their drive folders
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.200]   I feel like you've got more pressing things to worry about google
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:04.440]   Um google's worried about ai google's worried about bard and according because of this apparently too
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:09.160]   They're gonna have fewer micro kitchens in their office. So sorry googlers
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.080]   No, no free lunch. No more free lunches for you. Thanks to ai. I guess
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.840]   Wait, what was the actual rationale?
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:21.880]   I that is the reporting I have seen i'm looking at a post here uh, story here from washington post
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.360]   um
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.760]   They haven't said a in actual like reasoning
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:33.320]   But all we know is like google is focusing so much on bard and so many other things so
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.040]   Uh, they are cutting micro kitchens
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:41.880]   Uh that populate their office with three snacks cereal cells espresso, selser water stuff like that
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.320]   Um
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.960]   They're also laying off a ton of people too, right? So google is in like a major cost cutting mode right now
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.120]   So it was microsoft. So it was pretty much every major tech company. We talked about that a great week
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.120]   Then we talked about apple doing it. Yep
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:24:00.280]   Um, I mean, yeah apple doing it too. I think tim cook like famously, um took a major pay cut
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:05.080]   Right as part of this or like wasn't getting a major pay. Yes, although he's still making tens of millions of dollars
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.360]   He'll be okay. He has stock. He will be perfectly fine
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:14.520]   Um, but yeah, that was the thing um and also hearing that news compared to like what we've seen from some japanese companies too
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:20.200]   Like nintendo being like we'll just pay you guys more things are hard out here. We understand you employees
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:26.200]   here's more money instead of taking away your jobs and your christmas. So that's that's something man
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.480]   That was really interesting is to think about
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:36.360]   Like I never I can maybe just you know during the time being in texas long I never thought we get to the point where we're talking about
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.720]   the
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.240]   thing if you will
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.040]   Um
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.840]   Trying to cut costs that part just seems
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:48.520]   Absolutely bananas to me because you know back when I was at corporate
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.680]   The the lavish just random things that would happen
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:57.800]   Um, I remember going into the cafeteria one day and like oh we have a sushi bar now
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.080]   And the chef we've flown in from japan, you know
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.640]   And it was cool aspies japanese, right?
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.640]   So it was cool to go to the counter and order my food in japanese and he was so excited
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.840]   To like be able to talk to some employee in japanese
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:16.680]   And it's just weird. I never thought we'd be talking about these guys cutting costs and it does seem a little silly
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:24.760]   Because yeah, there's still the richest companies out there. So for sure like they they were still um, I have not seen google's earnings
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:28.680]   I mean everybody was worried about profits slowing. I don't know if profits have actually dipped for google
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:34.280]   Anthony you may be paying closer attention to that sort of thing, but uh, I don't like microsoft like was was seeing
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.480]   Um
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:39.640]   They they have been so high in cloud earnings for a while and that dipped a little bit and everybody freaked out
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.520]   So
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.600]   I don't know. I don't know what's going on here
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:48.680]   But uh another another indignity to google employees. They may be issued a chromebook instead of a macbook
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.480]   Uh the next time they get a new computer. So I find that just hilarious
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.120]   Not the biggest chromebook fan in the world
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:01.640]   Um, but yeah, that is like so many different things cost-cutting measures all over the place
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:06.920]   and related to like all of this to um, related to the layoffs
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.000]   Google workers in luncheon in london also staged a walkout
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.960]   um a walkout protest over this stuff too. So
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:19.320]   It is it is very weird like i'm sure we're gonna look at google and see like oh yeah, they're the revenues are still like
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:22.120]   killing it um
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:29.960]   I mean, I think that it's easy also to focus on sort of some of the more kind of fun headlines like the micro kitchens
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:35.640]   chromebooks instead of a macbook. Yeah, although I would I would definitely struggle with that. Um, I think
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.560]   Yeah
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:41.640]   The challenge I or I guess the bigger question and and this is also to docs plan, right?
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.080]   It's like it's not just the companies could spend lavishly because
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:50.040]   Yes, they were you know, pampering their engineers and but it was also about the idea that
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:55.800]   They were doing well enough and wall street investors were impressed with them enough that they could be like, hey
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.400]   We're gonna invest in these projects and they're not gonna pay off for 10 years
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.600]   And we're just but we think it's important for where the future is going
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.840]   And um and we can spend billions of dollars on this and you know, sometimes they were right
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:11.960]   Sometimes they were wrong. Um, but I think that if you go to a situation where
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:19.480]   You know google facebook, you know, faying has to be just super super hyper focused on like what is the quarter-lit earnings report look like?
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.600]   Have we cut costs enough that like the analysts will be happy with us?
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.520]   um
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.440]   That is I think of yeah
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:32.680]   I mean that that that's just a very very different environment and and I think that really changes the culture of these companies and their ability to
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.680]   Uh, you know builds for the future and to think long-term
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:42.520]   I must wonder how much of this is a response to to people just saying like they they want to work remotely more too
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.520]   Like you're not going to have as many office perks at all
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:49.320]   Although google and a lot of other companies are trying to get people back into the office at least part of the week too
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:54.120]   So this is a weird pushable thing happening over on the google side of things. Um
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:28:00.760]   It kind of is funny to me to think that uh going to chromebooks is kind of a downsizing for google employees too
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.040]   But also not everybody needs a MacBook so I get it. I totally get it
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:09.080]   It is also weird as somebody I used to have to you know figure out the it purchasing plan for a small college and like
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.560]   I took that seriously it was like, okay
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.800]   I want my users to have the good stuff that they can actually use that will be functional for them. Um
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:21.080]   It's going to be hard to justify chromebooks just for some people, but I guess if you work at google
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.960]   That's most of your work, right? You probably don't need too many other apps
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:30.680]   Just imagine like being at the google office and suddenly having a macbook is the status symbol because I imagine there's some people that
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:34.360]   They're not they're gonna be like, no, I'm keeping this computer get the hell away from me
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:42.040]   I have to make art. I have to do all sorts of stuff. Um, yeah, the chromebook is not enough. Hey, I
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:45.480]   I love the idea of chromebooks. I love the idea of cheap chromebooks
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.560]   But man when they started getting expensive when they started becoming premium computers
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:50.760]   I
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:57.240]   I just had to raise my hand and call shenanigans on some of that stuff. Um, okay moving on from google
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.240]   What do you guys feel about?
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:05.800]   E3 I don't know if twit has talked about this yet, but this is something we have been talking about in gajut quite a bit
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.200]   Because we were trying to figure out like hey
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:13.160]   E3 is the big video game trade show. Um, you know typically happens annually in l.a
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:18.360]   Although I think I forget if there was actually live one last year and after you know in 2020
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.880]   It was canceled because of the pandemic they've been virtual for a little while as I recall
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:27.480]   But e3 2023 is officially canceled and to me this signals like a huge c change for
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:34.680]   The video game industry and like the media landscape around gaming to any thoughts on this before we die further. I will say
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:38.440]   Uh video games were the first kind of tech thing that I cared about as a kid
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:43.480]   I remember reading about e3 and in game pro and nintendo power. I I
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:44.280]   I
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.160]   It sounded like disney was like oh my god. I have to eat three
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.160]   I was lucky enough to report on e3 for a couple years for various publications
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:54.280]   Uh, yeah, I'd agree it feels like this is you know
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:59.720]   They haven't said that e3 is canceled forever, but this year is canceled and you know the reasons why are are
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:04.920]   There's multiple, you know all the publishers have their own twitch streams and tendo, you know,
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:12.920]   Nintendo directs they don't really need to pay the esa a site fee to tell the world about the new zelda game or to tell the world about the new
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:19.320]   Assassin's creed or whatever it may be uh, so I do think that the idea of kind of like a centralized trade show
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:26.760]   So show trailers for new games is kind of you know, especially if you're like cost cutting or like looking as like
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:32.840]   Do I really just spend all that money flying these people at it's like it doesn't make a ton of sense when you can get just as much engagement
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:37.160]   Uh for free on twitch or youtube or whatever the case may be or
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:42.680]   Hosting your own event where you're kind of like what apple does with the apple doesn't go to mac world anymore
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.120]   They have their own shows, you know, they control the production from a to z
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:49.000]   So if you're like trying to guards if you're microsoft in xbox
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:52.120]   Uh at most why don't we just have our own show?
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:56.040]   Uh where we control everything and we can keep the cost so to where we like them
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:01.000]   So yeah, it does feel you know as as a as a rapidly aging gamer
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.960]   It does feel a little sad that it's all like oh man
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:10.280]   Yeah, e3 is like it used to be really cool like it's hard to you know, if you're if you're 18 years old today
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:17.640]   You probably don't understand what e3 was these days are so spoiled they have a perfectly realistic Mario movie that they can go see
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.360]   That looks exactly what just so yes, it was awesome of his great
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:22.680]   It's enough like man service in there
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:28.040]   Uh to make me happy, but yeah, it does feel sad that e3 like the shiny event our Oscars
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.280]   Our like big event of the year is now like
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:33.880]   Uh kind of going away. It's kind of depressing Anthony
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:35.320]   You know, yeah
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:38.360]   Was funny Nicholas is I was gonna say to me
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:46.280]   One of the saddest moments of my life in tech was the day that we're all walking out of moscone at the very last mac world
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:50.920]   Now the last three were already apple wasn't even coming
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:56.600]   Yeah, it was mostly all of us guys from you know gizmodo and gadget to uh, you know
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:02.440]   All the other sites out there mac OS kin merely man, you know all of the top guys brent terpsichord
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.440]   Everybody we would all get together hang out
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:10.440]   Enjoy each other's company see new tech that was coming out enjoy all of the 1300 cases
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:14.600]   That was the joke at the time was it's like, you know case fest
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:19.960]   And it was like I said to see it go but we'll be all right and I swear to you every system
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:24.360]   We get together about the same time every year and start messaging you those men of mis you bro
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:29.880]   I wish I could see you or you know, it's kind of funny and uh, you know, uh,
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:33.640]   Luria the aforementioned cali luis like I talked to her literally every day
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:39.320]   And you know mac roe was when you know, we would see each other in real life and and you know get to get to hang out
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:45.880]   So that part of it is going to suck where you are so right they can do so much better with their own
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:53.720]   and once you know, uh google i/o and you know facebook's event and then again, you know,
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.560]   WWDC
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:58.840]   Has already proven to everybody that you should kind of just run your own event
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.440]   If you're big enough
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:05.240]   Better yeah if you're big enough so where it hurts is it hurts the small guys the guys that are creating things
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:12.840]   To move the industry along and a lot of companies is so crazy now a lot of companies come from that last back wall
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:16.920]   With a tiny little small companies. I work for one of those companies now
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:22.600]   That used to be on the back wall. They they made a cool plugin for print is called prantopia
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:28.760]   And now we're e-cam live and you know, stike call recorder and one of the best live streaming platforms
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.360]   But I remember when those guys were teenagers with the little table in the corner
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.960]   And after I worked with them and I got to meet them again
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:42.120]   I swear I met these guys before they just happened to be cleaning the mac world like business car box
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:47.880]   And I found blends car and i was like glen. I did interview back in like 2013 i interviewed
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.000]   About like printopia or eyeglasses
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:57.080]   And it's funny that I worked there with them now and so so many good companies came from that small
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.560]   You know back wall speaking anchor
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:05.000]   Belkied even you know, they were just tiny guys in the corner and now they're venums, you know
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.480]   It does feel like we're losing something right so like
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:10.360]   Nicholas like i'm i'm right there with you like I
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:16.760]   My formative tech moment was I was probably five years old and I saw super mario brothers one at my cousin's house
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.880]   And I was like oh
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:22.360]   Like a lightning struck my brain. I was like oh everything is different after this so
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:26.440]   I remember like crying and wailing and like not wanting to leave that room at all
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:30.440]   And I got in the nia shortly after but yeah games were always my first tech love
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:35.880]   So I also read about e3 in game pro as a kid like in the nines be like oh, this is the coolest thing
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:40.760]   I'd love to go here at some point. Um in high school. I was in electronic sales associate at office max
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:47.400]   Which made me industry i was like oh man. I was I was just excited about the possibility of even getting potentially getting to go
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:53.080]   Um, never actually went in high school. No, but yeah, I enjoyed going to the show
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.840]   Like it was really cool to like see these events see some of the booths. I went
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:02.840]   Shortly after the switch launch so I saw like a whole bunch of stuff in the head of like mario odyssey
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:07.960]   Nitto had like a crazy booth for that. It is like it's an incredible thing
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.400]   That's also a weird thing because it is a trade show. It's a place made for business deals
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:15.720]   It's not really the place where you always go to see the shiny new things
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.560]   um
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:22.200]   It it's a weird thing. It's a very strange thing because yeah, all the companies can do their own stuff now and also
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.040]   You've got packs. You've got other ways. You've got the summer game show
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:32.920]   You've got jeff kelly like doing his own shows and premiering trailers all the time and being really like buddy buddy with developers
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:37.640]   So the landscape is just so different like there is no room for e3 anymore sort of and
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:41.000]   I understand why i'm just sad about it personally. Yeah
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.400]   Same. Yeah
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.840]   Yep
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:47.960]   Uh anthony any thoughts. I don't know if e3 was on your radar at all
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:54.120]   Not I mean it was definitely I had the same experience as you guys as a kid where I would I would read about it a lot and think about going
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.000]   I think that once I got into writing about tech professionally
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.240]   The the game the gaming world was sort of so separate that I didn't really spend a lot of time there, but
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:09.560]   um, my sense of it was also that it was like a beast right it was just so big and
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:16.280]   It's something for so many people. Yeah. Yeah, and it's interesting to wonder about you know like you guys are talking about there's so many other
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:22.200]   Game events in the calendar. I imagine others will come up as sort of filling that vacuum for for e3 but
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.640]   um
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:29.080]   To what it where is there still room for like the giant trade show that like is just a giant convention center
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.680]   That you have to like you get hired, you know, just walking from one end to the other
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:38.120]   I feel like that that's games. Come so that's the thing in klun, germany, which is bigger than e3 like games.com is
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:41.800]   Huge and i've done games.com. I did one year and that was a horrible trip
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.960]   But games come itself was kind of cool. Um, but yeah, that that is a thing that still exists
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:46.760]   I think
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:52.200]   Um, and that was always like a better place for your european and asian developers to kind of join up and talk to each other
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:53.160]   So
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:58.520]   I think that'll still be the thing but I I will miss e3 e3 like it represents so much of gaming for me
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:01.240]   But yeah, things are just so so different now
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.960]   Let's head back to leo for another
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:04.920]   sponsor
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:08.680]   Hey everybody. Thank you for letting me barge in here for just a moment
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.600]   I flew all the way to africa. I'm in tanger
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.680]   Morocco
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.680]   And I kind of did it to make a point
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:19.160]   Our sponsor today is mirror
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:24.840]   Look employees these days are no longer coming to the office. Some of them are working from home
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:31.560]   Some of them are working from elsewhere in the world, but there's one great way to keep everybody on the same page
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.440]   A productive and that's mirror
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:40.440]   Miro is a whiteboard solution, but that doesn't do it justice. Miro is whatever you need it to be a place
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:45.800]   For everybody working on a project to come together to put their ideas to keep up with what's going on
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:50.600]   Even if they work in different times of they could see what's actually happening with mirror
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:57.080]   And miro could be used in so many different ways use it to time your zoom calls for ice breakers for brainstorming
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.400]   Use it to design a new product
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.120]   Miro integrates with all sorts of applications
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:06.680]   We use it with zappier and a variety of other applications google docs and slack
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.920]   But you can make miro your own and that's the beauty of mirror
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:17.640]   Miro is great for anybody who's working with a team and any team no matter where they are
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.320]   Anywhere in the world. That's the beauty of mirror
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:28.600]   Miro's infinite collaborative whiteboard gives product teams a perpetual space where they can simply drag and drop insights and data
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.680]   Nothing's lost. Nothing's forgotten
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:34.280]   Miro covers pretty much any possible use case in the world
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:40.200]   So users could build visual assets present findings run brainstorms with cross functional teams
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.840]   I think miro's the coolest thing ever mike and i've been using it for our show
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:52.120]   Ask the tech guys and it's a great way for us even in different continents to stay in touch and plan together
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:54.360]   Miro gives your team
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:57.400]   The chance to always stay connected to real-time information
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:02.520]   No matter where they are it gives project managers and product leads a bird's eye view of the whole project
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:08.280]   To ensure nothing slips through the cracks be part of a more than a million users who join miro every month
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.160]   And you know what they say and I think our experience has been the same
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.720]   Miro saves on average
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:18.280]   80 hours a year per user that's like two weeks enough time to
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:22.040]   Take a little vacation to maybe morocco
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.600]   So folks look

[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:12.040]   Thanks leo. I am so jealous and uh, let's check out what else is happening on the twit network this week
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:17.960]   Or if that's an example of what folks can uh can look forward to uh when they're trying to get involved
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:21.000]   Sure. I can highlight a few of
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.520]   Sorry, I just I fell off the chair
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:34.280]   Previously on twit
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:41.880]   Hands on mac it's time to take a look at some keyboard shortcuts for text selection on macOS
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:44.440]   Stay tuned all about android
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:49.880]   You know those ios folks have their air drop and you were wondering huh wouldn't it be nice if android had something
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.480]   More like airdrop. I mean we already kind of have it which has sort of been around for a bit nearby share
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:58.760]   It's kind of taken another step to be more of an a proper airdrop
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:06.680]   You know competitor with a recent launch of a windows 10 beta and it will allow you to share files between your android devices
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.120]   And your windows pc this week in google
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.000]   I said uh, I need a name that sounds like jeff javis, but sounds evil like an evil twin
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.440]   And here is what uh the ai compiled
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.360]   Said
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:26.760]   How about jex javros it has a similar sound to jeff javis but with a more sinister and menacing swiss
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.680]   jex javros
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.680]   Well jax i think sounds perfectly
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.160]   Have your passion this is your brain
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.480]   Good ravros. This is your brain on twit any questions
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:43.880]   See every time now i've got this little jeff jarvis irks, excuse me jex javros sitting on my shoulder
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:47.400]   Who depending on what words i'm using on one shoulder
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:49.640]   Yeah jeff is like exactly
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:52.760]   Look at your tagline jeff
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.920]   There we go
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:01.720]   And we're back and uh, you know what guys we were just talking about the super mario brothers movie
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.520]   Uh, nicholas. He it sounds like you've seen already anthony stock have you guys seen it yet?
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:11.240]   Not yet. No, yeah, i want to see dungeons and dragons instead also control. I highly recommend
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:17.240]   Yeah, that movie that movie we are we're spoiled for great movies right now guys john wick for all this stuff. Yeah
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:23.400]   Um, just want to point out like uh, I think a lot of us expected the super mario brothers movie to be big
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:27.480]   But it is uh apparently a phenomenon it is huge
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:34.280]   Um over its five day opening weekend. Uh, it raked in 146 million dollars domestically
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:40.040]   Uh, which makes it the biggest release of the year and uh, the global debut the global like box office
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:47.320]   1977.5 million. I've read globally. That is the largest debut the largest opening for an anime movie
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:51.320]   But uh, i'm seeing like conflicting stats there that's a lot of money
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.280]   It's doing pretty well certainly better than the live action my brother's movie from what?
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:02.360]   92 so i saw that as a kid and it broke my heart and I saw this one is like, okay
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:09.880]   Not not perfect. Uh, I reviewed it over the engadget um, but it is certainly like the the animation
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.600]   It's beautiful. Like I think it's funny enough and I think like jack black is bowser perfect
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:18.680]   That was a great choice. Not all the casting is good. I'm not not a huge fan of chris pratt
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:19.560]   But uh
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:24.040]   Good a good thing for mario. I'm probably like a good thing for whatever nintendo decides to do moving forward
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.920]   I seem to I've read that there was this elder movie in the works
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:33.400]   Um thoughts guys like is it is it a good thing that this movie which is not the best movie out there
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:37.480]   But seems good enough for kids. You know, it was a good brat thing that's being so successful
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:44.840]   I think it's kind of speaks to nintendo's kind of expertis at like stewarding their their ip to sound like a wall street journal article
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:49.880]   Uh, they're really good at that type of that. They just opened up the uh, the theme park in california
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:53.880]   Uh, it was a very good movie. You know for kids for 40 year old kids
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:57.240]   Uh, it it hit pretty much hit all the notes for me
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:02.440]   There was enough like fan service and a kind of like inside references that unless you really played the games of death
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:06.200]   You wouldn't have noticed. Yeah, but yeah, I think it was just really well executed and
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:11.080]   Yeah, I I you know, let there be more I I would look forward to azale the movie
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:15.240]   Uh, mario too. I like the donkey con was in there. They seem to
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:18.680]   This is I don't know. This is about as good as it was going to be. I think
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:24.280]   Yeah, it's very basic and sort of like my thing is it's also like very safe, right?
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.840]   I almost feel like nintendo like was there like uh nintendo executives were there
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.880]   Approving every single decision like whatever happened here is like we cannot have another
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:38.920]   Mario movie failure, right? We have to it has to be perfect has to be exactly what the fans want
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:39.800]   and
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.560]   I do kind of feel like it's a bit constrained by that because ultimately it is
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.960]   Mario goes to the mushroom kingdom with ligi and you know, they defeat bowser like that's it
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.040]   It's everything we've seen before you hit some super
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:55.480]   He hit some smash brothers references you get some mario card stuff in there. You have sephrogan is donkey con
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:58.680]   Good casting. I don't think he was actually doing that much
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:02.680]   But you know jack black is bowser uh, not going full meatloaf
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:08.760]   But certainly bowser doing a few like rock ballads on the on the piano like that was fun fun enough
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:11.640]   I feel like is this thing i'm hoping like moving forward like they
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:18.280]   Nintendo let's them actually stretch a little maybe creatively. I don't know like maybe I compare everything to the lego movie
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:22.440]   Which is a frickin masterpiece, right? And we've had so many good animated movies
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:28.440]   um mainly because of christopher miller and philip lord, um, I mean they were partially behind
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.760]   Into the spider versus rel so really anything those guys touch is gold
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:38.920]   But we're a little spoiled and then I do not understand the abject hate from some of the reviews for this movie because i've seen
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:43.800]   I have a lot of film critic friends and so people like want to destroy this movie even though i'm like guys
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:50.600]   I I sat through space jam too, you know, I sat through far worse movies aimed at kids that
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:55.560]   Activate far fewer brain cells in this thing. So I don't know I was totally fine with it
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.600]   Anthony doc like will you guys ever end up seeing it you think?
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:02.280]   I'll probably have no choice. Um because of my knees
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.840]   But i'm just glad to hear somebody else say that they're not a fan of christprett
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.120]   I
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.560]   Mean listen say yeah, that's a whole online controversy
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:14.760]   I think he's perfectly fine the internet kind of turned on him at one point
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:19.080]   I loved him park some rec. I loved him in the first two guardians of the galaxy movies and then
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:22.040]   I think it was Jurassic world wherever we was like, oh no
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:27.720]   Uh, what would he give me a loud christprett to turn into and uh, I hate Jurassic world so
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:32.440]   Uh, we're in the same page. All right down the list you covered it
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:39.880]   That's like the whole the whole thing. Um, I think the thing is there was a lot of controversy around his casting right and
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:42.520]   mainly because people were like
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:47.720]   Didn't he just voice a cartoon man like he was also the lead in the lego movie, which is a very good movie
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.440]   Um, his mario voice is kind of uninspired and this movie also had a big delay
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.880]   And I think we don't fully know like what was the cause of that delay if it was like story work or whatever
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:46:58.840]   But
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:05.080]   It could have been something as simple as like having to redo the lines and there were stories that his original mario voice was a little like
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:08.200]   Tony soprano esque and maybe nintendo didn't want that
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:15.720]   Understandable, I guess yeah the next one will be uh voiced by 11 lab. So I guess we got a big crap while my god
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:20.920]   I mean charlotte charlotte martin is in the movie the voice of mario as we know him, uh, but not playing
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:26.440]   He's playing uh my roost dad another character. I'll keep a little secret. Oh the fun little fun little surprise
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:32.760]   But yeah, he is literally mario's dad. So anyway mario movie is a thing. Well hugely successful
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:37.960]   Take that sonic. I guess I don't know it's more successful than sonic except I think that movie
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:43.880]   Is actually more fun and took more creative risks because i had jim carrey and full on like jim carrey zany mode
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:49.240]   Um, so man, it is a weird thing to think about but I guess also seika had far less to lose, right?
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:56.040]   So true kind of in other gaming news. Oh something I want to mention to you that broke
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:00.440]   Uh towards the end of this week. There was a report from insider gaming about a new
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:07.080]   PlayStation handheld and a very confusing one because according to the report it is an eight it has an eight inch screen
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:11.640]   It is an all it does is remote play from the PlayStation five
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:17.400]   That's at least according to the report. It is a screen that you hold with a game controller and apparently has like dual sense
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:21.480]   It has like the dual sense motion stuff in the haptic feedback
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:28.520]   But it is just a dummy screen for the remote play on the ps5. We don't know if this is actually going to be a thing
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:36.360]   Um, but looking at sony as a company. I am always deeply frustrated with i'm like this sounds like a dumb thing sony would do sure
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.520]   Yeah, that makes sense
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.200]   Thoughts guys if this actually ends up being a remote play device only
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:47.560]   I was said that i'm surprised to have popular remote play and kind of local game. If you mean is
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:52.680]   I did not like just like you don't have to go far online to find people talking about how awesome it is
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.240]   Uh, so that is that was kind of surprising to me
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:01.480]   Uh, but yeah, I guess if sony wants I mean they've seen the success of the switch the steam deck which to me was the gadget
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:07.400]   Really the steam deck 20. Yeah, but I guess gadget last year and it has really kind of changed the way that I play games
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:12.600]   Uh, pretty substantially actually and then there are there are smaller kind of chinese comes air bernick
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.080]   retroid that kind of or go right that that like produce these handheld devices that
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:19.480]   Uh unlock the ability to play
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:25.640]   Stream games either from the cloud or from your local network. Uh, that was not a thing five years ago certainly 10 years ago
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:29.960]   So, uh, yeah, I guess I would also agree that i'm a little bit frustrated with what sony does
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:32.040]   It's like why can't you just make the vida too?
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:37.720]   I can't you just be good. Why can't you just be normal? So just be normal. I reviewed
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:42.040]   I think two or three years ago. I reviewed some neck speakers that sony made which were literally like
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:48.120]   It was like a cow collar that sits around your neck and they're just speakers that point up
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:50.680]   And they didn't support bluetooth
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:53.960]   Um, they were requiring this weird like wired dongle
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:59.560]   Um, and they were very clunky and they didn't sound good and they cost like I think over 300 dollars
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:04.600]   And the entire time I was writing in my write-up of that thing. I was like, what are you doing sony?
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:09.960]   Like you're sony you gave us the walkman. Um, you gave us the playstation
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:13.560]   Nobody wants neck speakers. What are you doing?
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:18.520]   Meanwhile, they can still produce some of the like best headphones out there. They're noise gambling stuff are still really good
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:24.280]   Um, it's just funny to me like I yeah, I would not be surprised if sony made a thing like this
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.400]   The only thing is um, if it was a hundred dollars or less
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:32.360]   I could see that being useful to people if they just want to remote play from their playstation five
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.240]   Otherwise, just you could probably get any any sort of like game streaming
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:42.280]   You know handheld that would cost 200 ish and would also be able to use cloud streaming
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:45.160]   Um, which I think a lot of people would be more useful, right?
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.760]   Yeah, I think that was one of the bigger criticisms of the logic tech
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:50.440]   Right
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:55.880]   for a photo from last year where it was like really cool and divide but it was like a hundred dollars too expensive for what it does
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:00.760]   So pricing seems to be for the if you're just releasing a screen basically
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:04.600]   You have to price that appropriately if it's not like a full powered
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:08.600]   Console or whatever and you're just selling a screen with some buttons attached to it
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:12.680]   Uh, people are aware of what that should cost. Uh, especially sony
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:20.200]   I mean they just launched the psvr2 which doesn't appear to have done super well at least early indications. Yeah, uh, so
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:22.120]   I don't know what they're doing otherwise
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:27.000]   So slow sales error and I reviewed the psvr2 and my my main complaint there was like oh my god
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.880]   This hardware is amazing. Why is it more expensive than the playstation 5? So what are you doing?
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:37.800]   It is strange. Um, I mean the tech the tech in the psvr2 is very good like compared to a lot of other vr headsets
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:41.000]   I'm sure they're they're probably already selling that at a loss
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:47.240]   But if they want this thing to actually succeed, sony can I has to bite the bullet a little more? I'd say
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.360]   um
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:51.000]   Anthony have you partaken in any of these uh,
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.480]   Little handheld gaming devices because I don't know
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:56.120]   I don't think you have a pc that would play games
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:52:02.040]   But these things like solve a lot of problems for you and people who want to play games. Yeah, honestly like, um
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:05.880]   I think that most of my gaming at this point is yeah, like on my
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:09.560]   Mac or on my ipad so i'm not like a super serious gamer
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:12.040]   I did own the original uh, playstation
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:16.040]   PSP and that is actually the one sony device
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:18.200]   I mean gaming device that I've ever purchased
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:21.880]   So, you know bring back the the PSP why not but um
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:27.320]   Yeah, I think like the steam deck obviously is the one that is the most interesting to me and and I felt like
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:32.440]   At first a lot of the reviews were saying hey, it's not quite there. This is really for
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:38.920]   Um, you know people who want who really want to be on the bleeding edge and now it seems like it's starting to get a point where i'm
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:42.360]   I am considering it. I'm not very seriously. Yeah with with the price breaks
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:47.880]   I do feel like for for you, Anthony and for like a lot of people who can't justify gaming pc or even like a game console
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:52.360]   Something like that. It's just like well you could use it as sort of a console you could dock it to your tv
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:58.040]   But also it would give you access to so many games that you're probably hearing people talk about and you have no easy way to play
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:04.360]   You know and with cloud streaming you could play games that are even too powerful for that handheld system to handle so
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:09.640]   That was cool about the PSP when it was when it was out in very popular at the time
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:11.960]   Was doing my time in college in japan
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:17.480]   And then so the amount of people see people forget that you know sony, although it's a globalist company
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:22.200]   They're still a japanese company at heart. Yes, so two things that come to mind number one
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:25.720]   It's if I hired Anthony
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:28.680]   And i'm the boss
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:32.280]   It's hard for me to fire him because it makes me look like I did something dumb
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:38.040]   So what they might do is put him on the project in the corner like I need you to make
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:42.600]   Next speakers after you make those next speakers and they're hot trash
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.160]   That was a dumb idea
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:47.160]   Anthony
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.160]   Who meant to say wow
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:54.520]   So i'm assuming those are those are like sweating imagining those those are seppuku
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:59.240]   Jobs, right? I'm imagining what to me that device was so good
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:03.640]   And so I traveled from basically nearby ginsa a place called edigal bashi
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:06.520]   Everyday to kind of go to go to my university
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:14.360]   And so that time in the train everybody was you know with their PSPs or at that time the ds was very popular
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:18.040]   And everybody here was this was this like a live oh six okay?
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:19.320]   Yeah, oh five oh six here
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:23.240]   So everybody's there playing all of the games and it was fantastic you would go to these stores
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:29.880]   You would meet people outside and you know discuss blue games and you know trade gamer handles and things like that
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:31.960]   You know it was really cool situation
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:36.200]   The phone brought a lot of that level stuff, but the controls are junk
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:41.080]   So when uh steel and these other guys made boxes you can wrap your phone with
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:45.560]   That would do it or the last update that allows us to just connect
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:48.520]   a dual shock controller or an
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.920]   Xbox elite controller to your phone and go to town
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:57.800]   That kind of like covered it, but there was something so dope about a device that was just for gaming
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:01.240]   Yep, so if you're doing so good
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.640]   I would love for sony to get out of their own way
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:11.000]   And come back and even microsoft because i'm actually a little bit more xbox these days
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:15.080]   I would appreciate them coming up with the switch level device
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:18.200]   And the hardest part of that right now
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.480]   I believe
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:26.040]   Is the only people that make a processor dope enough to do all of that and given them the processor and that's my team
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:30.040]   So they got a k they got to come up with a processor that's you know
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:36.040]   Mx oriented that will allow them to bring all of that firepower to such a small device
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:43.800]   I mean one of the reasons the seem deck has done so well is because of uh, you know better radion like mobile graphics
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:47.000]   It's it's kind of it like and the gp is getting better for handheld. So
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.200]   I could I could see microsoft dipping their toes in this there there have been rumors about that too
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.520]   But at the same time like man, I I sometimes just pick up my vida and look at that thing
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.200]   I was like this is a beautiful object. This is a beautiful piece of consumer electronics
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:03.560]   And I really wish sony had given it more of a chance, you know
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:07.480]   Whoever gets in bed with invidia and locks them down
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.200]   Will bring it to the table because invidia is the closest right now
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:15.160]   And invidia just has some amazing stuff
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:20.120]   So whoever can like without them trying to do their own thing because they're not good at doing that
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:22.520]   Right they need to work with a legacy partner
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:25.320]   And I feel if sony and or microsoft
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:29.320]   Would jump in with invidia and be like let's lock this down and not lose it
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:32.920]   They can take on and just bury the switch it could be I mean
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:37.960]   That could that could be something I do feel like everyone's looking aimed at now because the playstation 5 the xbox
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:43.400]   All the xboxes are powered by AMD and AMD is much better at integrated hardware rather than invidia so story
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:45.320]   Yeah, yeah, we'll see
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:49.480]   Um, I would love to see that I would just love to see sony succeed again because I've wrote a piece
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:51.320]   Um a couple of years ago
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:57.480]   I think on sony's like one of sony's major anniversaries and they would not talk to me for that piece and the piece ended up being
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:02.360]   Um, will sony ever be like consumer electronics king or titan again?
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.560]   Because it doesn't seem like it like they're a company held up entirely by
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:08.920]   PlayStation and spider-man at this point pretty much
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:13.640]   Losing the mini-disc battle broke my heart. I have a stack right there
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:17.640]   I have a massive stack of being this and my player finally gave out
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:22.280]   But to me that was one of the dopest pieces of tech and somebody's mentioning in the chat
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:25.480]   How that the p at the psp ran on mini-disc
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:28.680]   Yo, I was heavy into my music creation at the time
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:32.920]   So in high school, I would look at the mini-discs and be like this is cool
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:36.280]   This is the future because it would also occasionally pop up in anime, right?
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:37.960]   I was like
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:44.280]   Japan's just another planet because the tech that they have is just far beyond whatever I was living with at the time
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:48.760]   So, okay, well, we'll see we'll see what's gonna happen with this potential in japan
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:54.600]   You could actually rent them, you know, so you want to hear a new album and it was like a lot of final fantasy game soundtracks
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:58:00.840]   So whatever you would just go to uh sataya and rent you your little mini-disc and listen to that on the train on a way to class
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.720]   You know, it was so cool. That was really sad to see it go
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:07.000]   Uh, that's a shame. That's a shame. You know what like yeah
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.280]   I'm hoping sony comes back with something by the way, this thing is reportedly called the q light and if that is the name then it does
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:15.640]   Makes sense. It's just like a remote streaming box. Yeah, that's kind of a thing
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:17.880]   That totally makes sense and uh, you know what?
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:21.480]   I also co-host the engager podcast guys and what I like to do at the end of my show
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:26.440]   Uh, is still like talk to you all about what you're watching with you're experiencing right now
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:33.480]   So is there anything that's making you happy these days any pop culture any media you want to shout out to tell the world about onto it?
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:42.200]   I just started watching beef on beef is yeah, and it is it's hard to watch because there's so much tension
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:47.080]   And it's like so real in a lot of ways. Um, but like
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:52.760]   It's like not to get super deep right then but like, you know, I'm an Asian American guy like and
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:55.560]   I'm in therapy right now. One thing we talk a lot about is like
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:59:00.600]   Being an Asian American and anger and repression and like this is perfect like literally
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:05.400]   I want my next therapy session to just be like, hey, can we just like watch together and talk about it?
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:09.000]   But even if that's not you, I think it's a great show. I mean, it's just like
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:17.480]   So like the acting is amazing like it's like really weird too and it's a really feels like perfectly observed of a highly highly recommend beef
[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:22.440]   Disafframe it beef is Steven yune versus ali wong and like an epic epic beef battle
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:28.520]   Which starts off with a road rage incident and just like gets gets more and more crazy and kind of wild
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:29.720]   Um
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:35.080]   A critic I really enjoy and one of my friends raksona had daddy her reviewed vulture is beef feels bad
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:40.600]   But she loves it so it's a positive review, but it feels it's bad vibes because of like how
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:46.200]   Tense the show makes you so that is a really good one. Thank you, Anthony. You guys have anything else you want to shout?
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:49.720]   It's funny. I'm watching beef. Uh, of course
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:55.000]   Here's here's something that you guys might know most of my my crowd knows I was uh
[01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:02.280]   Adopted by korean families. So I grew up mostly in asian culture and went to college in japan
[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:08.440]   I live in huai which is you know, 76% Asian population. So I fully understand
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:15.640]   The what's going on in beef and it's kind of hilarious to me because i'm like if my dad was still alive
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:19.560]   He would look at steven and be like that's you when you drive, you know
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:23.560]   My dad always get mad at me because i'm such a road ranger
[02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:27.080]   But my road rage would come from oh, I think would just drive bad
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:30.600]   And you know growing up in the east coast like I was around
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:35.560]   Bad people that actually knew how to drive and why they're bad people that can't drive
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.320]   So
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:40.760]   In my daddy's always give me so much crap because I was always yelling at people
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:44.360]   You know, they can't hear you so if you're gonna yell at them roll out of windows they can hear you and i'm like
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:47.640]   They were gonna have to get into a fight and so yeah beef is true. But for me
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:53.480]   Is I don't know why because it's so campy and it's so cheesy, but it's the best thing running
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:55.960]   It's like water is not special
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:01:02.680]   But when you're super thirsty, I ice cold glass of water is so refreshing and to me ted lasso is water
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:05.960]   Like it's you that you get in better
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.760]   You know another tease in us with this being the end and yet they might you know
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.680]   There's a lot of like side conversation about there might be back when it's on the floor
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.880]   Lasso is just so good
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.680]   And it just lets you know
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:24.520]   That tv can be great and doesn't have to be so
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:30.600]   messed up and controversial whatever you can touch on issues without being campy about it and
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:34.120]   I think again, you know secret sauce
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:39.480]   I've been far removed from the fruit farm, but i'm rooting for us as a student a streaming service
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:42.440]   So you know winning 11 amies and having them do so well
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:45.960]   And then you know when you're done with that you can watch shrinkage
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:50.440]   You know like so yeah shrinking shrinking shrinking to something else
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:53.960]   Right there
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:56.840]   So you're the one old guy he says dumb stuff
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:04.440]   But yeah, it's it's so good and I hope that they can continue and i'm ready to see some of the spin-offs
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:11.960]   Because I feel it has positively impacted so so many people and that's just rare in tv now
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.960]   Yeah, it's I mean it's a sweet show
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:19.560]   It's about people trying to be better people and kinder and nicer to each other even though they're like they're
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:24.440]   Swearing there are adult situations and there's like conflict in there too. It's such a rare show
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:29.560]   But I also are another shout out to shrinking doc because um i've been watching that too
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:32.120]   Uh, that's co-created by brek goldstein
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.720]   You know who's also on ted lasso and also writer on ted lasso
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:41.240]   Um and also billorence who co-created ted lasso and also was the creator of scrubs
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:45.400]   So if anybody if you like the vibes of scrubs if you like that another feel good show
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:48.840]   Awesome show still like holds up today if you rewatch it
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:50.280]   um
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:55.240]   Shrinking is a show about a therapist who kind of has like an existential crisis is dealing with the grief
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:59.240]   Uh of the death of his wife and it's about him trying to piece his life back together
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:04.840]   And it's very much like ted lasso in that it is kind of a sad story about somebody who's kind of hurt
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:09.480]   But it's really about everybody coming together to help them and join them trying like find their purpose in life
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:14.040]   So shrinking also really good like a shout out billorence. Thank you. Thank you for bringing the award
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:17.080]   Thanks. Uh nicholas anything you want to shout out?
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.320]   Uh, yeah, there is a local
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:25.000]   uh game store here in to saan that will be having a game of thrones trivia night in a few weeks
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:29.240]   Uh, and I am now watching game of thrones more or less for the first time
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:31.880]   Uh, this this picture
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:38.440]   People yeah, I I feel like I saw some of the episodes when it first came out, but not not really basically
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:41.240]   Uh, and so i'm just about to wrap up season one
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:43.480]   Uh, it helps to have the subtitles on
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:48.520]   Uh, but it is very good. I'm enjoying it so far. So that is this is hot new show that i'm watching
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:50.840]   Game of thrones season one
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:52.920]   How far are you gonna try to get for the trivia night?
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:56.440]   Uh, I think i got two weeks. I feel like I could finish a season
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:02.520]   It was it's been like two or three days. So I don't know probably at least half. I'm shooting for
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:05.240]   I mean, I don't anticipate doing well in trivia to be honest
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:09.480]   Uh, but that yeah, that's what i'm up to. I mean you're gonna power through the good seasons
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.720]   I think you'll have a good time with that. Well, all right folks. Well, thank you so much
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:19.000]   Anthony ha from any ac mentors. How are things going in harlem and new york, Anthony?
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.680]   Uh things are good, you know, I think sometimes you hear
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:24.600]   Things about how
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:28.520]   New york, I mean the cities are crazy now near because great and not everything's perfect
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:31.960]   I mean rent is still insane. Don't get me started on that but um
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:36.840]   Another reason like I can't probably live live in the city again with a family, but yeah, yeah
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:41.640]   I don't know. I feel like things. Yeah things just have to get a little bit worse and then maybe rent will get better
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.560]   We'll see finger fingers crossed
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:50.280]   All right. We've got doc rock from youtube and hawaii and then i'm so jealous doc rock of like your life in hawaii
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:53.080]   Thank you so much for your point. It's good for the weather
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:58.040]   There are other reasons why I wish I was able to go somewhere closer because i'm going to nab and
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:01.240]   And a couple days and it's just always a trek in like
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:07.320]   That and when i'm in home in the mail and like is it? I'm just right there, but here it's like a whole trek
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:13.960]   And so yeah, why do we're talking about conferences? I'm fixing to go to a conference that is not going to be you know

[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:42.760]   Creating is probably the best way to really connect with your customers
[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:48.920]   And so if you miss the social media boat or whatever don't worry about it. I can teach people how to get there
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:55.400]   Creative juices for them to connect with their community and stuff like that because it is just amazing when you guys do your podcasts
