[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Once upon a time there were three little girls who went to the police academy.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   They were assigned very hazardous duties.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   But I took them away from all that, and now they work for me.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   My name is Charlie.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Hello angels, this is Leo LaPorte welcoming you to the next and last edition of the Return of the S***s.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Yes, that's right, the last.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Because we have a new name, and we're not going to call it that anymore, and I'm getting tired of bleeping out s***s every time I say it.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   So it's not the return of the s***s anymore.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Phew, my goodness.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   The new name will be revealed in due course.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   We do have a new name, and as a result we'll have all new URLs too.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   This podcast will no longer piggyback on my TLR podcast feed.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   It has a feed of its own, leoville.tv/podcast/twit, T-W-I-T.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   There'll be a couple of different feeds.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   There's one for MP3s, one for bookmarkable AACs for UIPod users and an Aug.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Vorbis for you open source types.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And they'll be available both in coral and bit torrent forms.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   There's also a direct URL.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   All of this is fully explained at my blog, leoville.com/blog.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So do please, after you listen to this podcast, modify your podcast software to point to the new feeds.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I want to make sure you all get next week's episode.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, Patrick Norton, Kevin Rose, Robert Herron, and from Beyond the Grave, John C. Devorek.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And this is the last edition of the return of the...
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   (beep) etc. etc.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Okay, who is playing... who is doing slam dancing in the back?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   What's going on? Somebody's dancing or something.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   What does that sound?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I hear that tapping.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Are you hammering, Patrick?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   (laughter)
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   The house that I'm leaving in the next month is...
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I don't know what my housemate is doing in the tub right now, but there's this really amazing three-part leak that's coming from up there.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Okay, well tell them to stop leaking and...
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Well, I'm waiting for it to stop.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   No, it's not a lot I can do.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   We got a lot of good suggestions for the show name, but one of the ones I liked the best, Patrick, was Sledgecast.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Nice.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Wouldn't that be great? It's a Sledgecast.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   We are going to unveil on the podcast this week our new name.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I'm embarrassed to say that it was none of... as far as I can tell, well, there's two possibilities, but the one that I'm kind of in favor with, nobody submitted.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Probably because it's so boring.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   We got so many creative, clever submissions.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You want to hear some of the names that people sent in?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Absolutely.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Al Hill said, "Saved by the Geeks."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   That's kind of keeping the screensavers idea.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   If I could number people did that.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Caudio Flores said, "WwSSD, what would the screensavers do?"
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   No.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   We'll leave that one out.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   There was also a G4 eats as young, but in a deference to G4, we'll leave that one out.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Are you now or have you ever been a G4 employee?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   No.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   How about this one? I think you'd like this one, Patrick.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Those, by the way, were all from Shane.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   This is from Lance.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Return of the meat popsicles.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Excellent.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Green megs of ram.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   That was from Kevin Davis.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I like that one.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Kurt Golic said, "Good fellows."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   But I think maybe geek fellows might be good.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Geek fellows.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   What do you think?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   No.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's pretty cool.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Kurt also suggested this week in geek, which is the closest to the one where I think I actually use.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   What do you think of this week in geek?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   That's not bad at all.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   We can call it geek week.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Twig.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   TWIG.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I like the fact that it rhymes.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   How about Alex's?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   My big fat video cast.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   My big fat tiger.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   My big fat geek wedding.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   My big fat geek cast.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Let's see.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Attack of the podcast.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   There's a lot of them were plays on Attack of the Show, Kevin.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I think that Dave said a hack of the show, which I kind of liked.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   A 10-year-old named Sonya suggested reunion of tech support scholars.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   She wanted to keep the ROTSS acronym.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   He hated tech support scholars.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   John Wilson, geek weekly.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   The pocket protectors, Ray Bromley.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That was a good one.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Here's one from Dustin that incorporates all of our kind of reputations.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It's the revenge of the dark tipping sledgehammer swinging PC modding lab rat tech guys.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Excellent.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's a little long winner, but I like it.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Hey, the domain name is available.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'm sure.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I think we could register that.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Was there a domain name somebody registered that was like because all the other good domain
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   names were taken, something like that.com?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   All the other good domain names were taken.com.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Joel suggested four guys in a box of crap.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Robert wasn't here last week.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.160]   He doesn't know that that's the grand prize for this is we're giving Patrick's going to
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   donate a box of crap from his garage.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Excellent.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   That's the grand prize.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Incredible.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Vital vintage computer technology.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Completely random.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Yes, credit will definitely be.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   The mystery prize.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that we're going to, I think we're going to go.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.800]   Robert, you weren't in on this conversation because you were busy finding headsets, but
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.000]   I think we're going to go with the boring this week in tech.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.840]   The only reason is I think the podcast has to say in its name what it is because otherwise
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.120]   when people look at it in the directory, they'll have no clue.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.000]   Is that so boring that we should just say no?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Oh, thanks for backing me up, guys.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Well, I think the Skype just faded out again.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Oh, it's yeah.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Same here, Leo.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Same here.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You couldn't hear a word I was saying.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.200]   So I've registered Twit.tv.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.600]   We are all Twits now.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.120]   Twit.tv will be the domain.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.520]   The email address will be thisweekintech@gmail.com.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.280]   And nobody is a winner, but somebody will get a box of crap as well as the four runners
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.200]   up we're all going to receive web hosting from VisaWeb and Jinx Hackware thanks to our
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.400]   donations there.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.880]   And that raises another issue.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.640]   Real quick before we get to, because Patrick wants to do a look at WinHack, which is the
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.400]   big Windows hardware conference that just ended.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.600]   And I know you all have lots to talk about, and we have a lot to talk about on the show
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   today.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.760]   But real quickly, I just want to mention we've decided not to take advertising, at least
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.000]   for the time being on the show.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.160]   I know that's kind of radical.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.880]   We want to support the show, and there are costs associated with it, like registering
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.400]   20 different domain names, which is what I did this week, trying to save all the ones
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.760]   that might be our winner.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.920]   So we thought it would be better if we asked for your support, your donations.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.320]   The podcast, I want the podcast to be free and always free.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.320]   And I think we all agree it's going to be that way.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.920]   It'll never be a subscription podcast.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:39.560]   However, we wouldn't mind if you subscribed as a way of donating.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.600]   So what I've set up is three buttons on the podcast page and on the feed for your choice.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.240]   Not required, podcast is free, but if you'd like to support the podcast, you can subscribe
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.120]   for $2 a month in a recurring subscription.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.720]   Now that's less than a latte a month, less than 50 cents a show.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.040]   We see less of it because of course PayPal takes its cut, I think 36 cents.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.800]   But I wanted to make it small so that everybody could participate.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.600]   There were some people who said, "Well, no, we'd like to just do it once a year."
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.960]   So that's a $20 a year subscription.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.560]   Again, that will recur.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.080]   So you can cancel at any time, but if you don't, you'll be billed again next year.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.600]   We plan to keep doing this for many years.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.360]   And also by the way, if you're worried that we'll go away but the subscription won't,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.600]   if for any reason we decide not to do the podcast anymore, I can with one button cancel
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.080]   all the subscriptions and I will do that of course.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.360]   And then I also am going to leave a donation button for those of you who don't want to
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.840]   subscribe but would like to make a small donation.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.680]   No donation too small or too large.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   I'd like to add.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.840]   You do such a good job at this thing.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.080]   I'm about to sign up right now.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.560]   I'm like, "This sounds great."
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.760]   I think $2, I mean, how much did you pay to subscribe to Tech TV?
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.440]   How much did you pay for your last gallon of gas?
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440]   Oh yeah.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.320]   I paid $3 for the first time last week.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.280]   I was stunned.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.960]   But so $2 I think is not an unreasonable amount.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.360]   And what it will do is it'll help us make this a better podcast.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.960]   It'll give us a reason to be here every week because we all need to make a living.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.720]   And it'll also show your support for grassroots user broadcasting on the net.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.800]   Nobody really has made a success of this by donation.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.840]   Everybody's trying to do advertising.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   My problem with advertising is I don't want to be anybody's pocket.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.560]   I think it'd be nice if we could just do this without advertising.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.360]   So we're going to try it.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   There you go.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.840]   That's my pitch.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.440]   By the way, Patrick, you should know that one of the first things we're going to do is
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.520]   buy you a Mac so we can do the video eye chat.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.520]   Oh no.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.360]   In fact, maybe we'll buy Kevin's iMac for you.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.360]   How much do you want for your mini, Kevin?
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.800]   I don't know, 500 bucks.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   You paid six.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.440]   Yeah, it paid six plus.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.280]   It's got a gig of ram and it upgraded the ram as well.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.200]   I think that would be good for Skype.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.000]   And then, Patrick, do you have a regular PC keyboard?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   If I want to ask you.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I think I can make it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.240]   I'll monitor lying around and just take one out of that box of crap.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.040]   No monitors in the box.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.800]   Because I really would like to try this.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   And do you have a DV camera, Patrick?
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.800]   No.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.040]   Oh, we're going to have to buy them an eyesight as well.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.120]   Oh, I can figure something out.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:24.240]   If any firewire camera will work on this with iChatAV.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.520]   And Robert, do you have a Mac?
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.520]   You don't have a Mac either.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   No, I don't.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.200]   You know what we're going to have to do is have video cameras and stuff.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.480]   What we're going to have to do is maybe make...
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.000]   I know there's some people who do this.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.800]   A little package that we mail around, whoever's going to be on the show that week, that comes
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.600]   with everything in it.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.400]   And you just plug it in and there you go.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   The camera and everything.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.240]   Because Devorak has told us he's going to join us and I said, "You have a Mac?"
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.240]   And he said, "No."
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.960]   Can you believe that doesn't even have a Mac?
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.120]   Anyway, we'll figure this out.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   But I would like to try it with video.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.120]   But Devorak's so soft and cuddly.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120]   I can't believe he's telling you the truth.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.640]   You probably didn't know I'd mention it.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.680]   I did tell him that he should call in and he could be on the show.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.840]   And so he said he may stop by from time to time.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.680]   So that would be nice.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.000]   So the big event of the week.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Win heck.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   The Windows hardware...
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   What is it?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Education?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Hardware?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Hardware?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.160]   Now I used to know that engineering.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   That's it.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.760]   The Windows Hardware Engineering Conference was this week.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.160]   Bill Gates revealed some details of Longhorn and I know Patrick Extreme Tech sent some people
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   up there.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.360]   Yeah, actually, Lord Case was up there and I'm sure a couple of the other guys.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.520]   Boy, it's got the softest hair of anybody in the showbiz, by the way.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.520]   I just want to mention it.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.520]   I'm going to take your word.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.600]   I might as well never touch boy.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.600]   Really nice hair.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   Go ahead.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   Sorry.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.600]   I have this vision of you petting his hair.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.080]   I haven't petted your hair.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.000]   You pet me all the time.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.400]   Well, because your hair is magnificent.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.760]   Everybody thought it was fakely.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.920]   That's why we all had to check to see if it was fake or not.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.760]   Was that why everybody was touching me?
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.800]   It was just to see if I was wearing a wig.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.600]   That's a good bit badger.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   It could be the man who's hair.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.080]   But if it's fake, it's glued on really, really well.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.120]   I don't think, you know, I don't have like Ted Koppel hair.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.960]   I think my hair looks like real hair, doesn't it?
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.400]   You have a magnificent pipe.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.280]   I paid a lot of money for this hair.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:24.480]   So, so Winheck, did they reveal anything about Longhorn that we didn't know already?
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   Not really.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   Actually, it's been interesting.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.880]   It's between the 64-bit windows and the release and the beta of Longhorn.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:38.680]   I think those two completely overshadowed anything that was going on in terms of actual hardware
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.400]   engineering at Winheck this year.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.200]   There's some pretty interesting side stories.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.320]   It's actually a good story in extreme text.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   Samsung actually announced that they're going to be middle of next year.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.680]   They're going to be shipping hard drives that include flash memory.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.480]   To basically reduce battery life consumption on notebooks.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:04.400]   So, they're basically going to put a gigabyte of flash onto the notebook to help reduce
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.640]   battery consumption.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.640]   How will that work?
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.400]   Will it be like a cache or?
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   Essentially.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   It'll be slow though.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.440]   Well, it's, it's, it depends on how they do it.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.040]   If it's, if it depends on how they set it up, but yeah, it'll, it'll, it, you know, that's
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.440]   a good question. I think it should still be faster than rotating media.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.480]   Right. So, you're basically writing it to the drive.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.160]   Well, I know you can get, you know, CF that's 40.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.160]   What is it? 40X?
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.160]   It's maybe 80X.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.440]   I mean, it's pretty fast now, I guess it's, but I mean, my USB 2 key that I have is faster
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   than my notebooks hard drive.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   It is.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.080]   I mean, it stains reading writes above, you know, about 12 to 14 megs a second as well
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.280]   as about two gigs in size too.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   So that just comes in handy.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.280]   So I can see that.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.040]   Well, I could see, for instance, if you're watching a DVD off the, or movie off the hard
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:02.120]   drive, if you could load it into the cash, the flash cash, oh, I like that, then you
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.800]   would save a lot of power.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.120]   They, they have the biggest, I mean, they're still the biggest, by far the biggest consumer
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   of electricity or battery power.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   Everyone to call it on a notebook is still the screen by far.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.560]   And we can't fix that.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.760]   Well, you know, not with existing technology, be an interesting idea if maybe if you had
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:27.640]   a organic and OLED screen, whether or not that would help, but it's, you know, it's,
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.960]   I don't think LCDs are going to lose their power consumption anytime soon.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.520]   What else happened?
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.120]   Um, you know, the long horn beta was released and everybody made fun of it.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.120]   Avalon looks pretty cool.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.120]   What's that?
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.120]   Avalon looks pretty cool.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.760]   What's the graphics layer that's going to replace DirectX?
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.920]   And, and other than that, they, they, they yanked a lot of the really interesting stuff
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.320]   that was supposed to go in the long haul.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.600]   No WinFS, the file system, that's gone.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.040]   Well, they're going to release that afterwards.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.800]   2008, or something.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.960]   What else did they yank out?
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.680]   I mean, it seems some people are starting to call it service pack three.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.840]   That's probably a pretty good thing to call it because they, they, they, if you, Avalon
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.480]   is still there, they've yanked out WinFS.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.360]   The Bates or, or, or raging as to how good the communications layer they've set up is
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.360]   going to be.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:28.360]   Um, you know, people are already making fun of the whole Windows 64 long horn split,
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.160]   which is another odd one.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.600]   Um, I don't know.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.280]   Microsoft for years have tried to narrow down into, into one operating system.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.520]   Now they're going bifurcating again.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.680]   Mm hmm. Is there going to, there's going to be 64 bit versions of long horn though,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   right?
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.680]   Correct.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.680]   No, no argument there.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.080]   But I think what part of what people are saying is, is, you know, they've, they've set
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.480]   themselves up for sort of yet another parallel set of operating systems.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.480]   Right.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.120]   Um, which I mean, given the fact that, you know, the most of the vast majority of the
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.960]   planet is running on 32 bit processors makes a lot more sense right now.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.480]   Um, yeah, I got to, I got to say though, not a lot of, you know, it's a thing.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.000]   I think, you know, some winhacks, it's just a lot of repeating what was going on in the
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   years before.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.360]   And that's, when, when heck is traditionally where Microsoft tells the hardware manufacturers,
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.840]   the delves of the world, what they should be doing so that they can support the next
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.040]   generation of Windows.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.520]   There's, there's win heck an IDF and basically, uh, uh, um, it, you know, at this point, it's,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.800]   it's, uh, I'm ashamed to admit I forgot which one was started in a hissy fit in a reaction
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.120]   to the other trying to control the platform.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.120]   The Intel developers forum versus the, you know, these guys is funny.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.440]   They've been, they'll develop earth.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.840]   There's no posh be there.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.840]   Developer.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   Pardon.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   Idea.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.840]   Developer forum.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.680]   Uh, it's funny how much these guys are at each other's throats given that they're the
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.400]   quote, wouldn't tell platform.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:58.240]   Um, so, so Bill, uh, did speak and he, and he said that, uh, what you, that even though,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.040]   uh, Longhorn will run on existing hardware, it won't run beautifully if you really want
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.400]   Avalon and all this, you know, if you really want the animated icons, which I know I look
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:14.080]   forward to and the transparency on the desktop, you're going to want a three gigahertz processor
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.440]   and a pretty hefty video card.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:24.480]   But at this point, you know, by the time it actually ships, you know, that three gigahertz
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.080]   processor should be well down into the hundred dollar range.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.640]   So meanwhile, while Microsoft's talking about vaporware, Apple comes along on Friday with
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   Tiger.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.000]   Did you, did you upgrade to Tiger?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.680]   Uh, Kevin, you've been using it for a while.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.000]   Yeah, I've been using it for a little while and I have to tell you I'm getting more.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I love it.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I, I really do.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.640]   I finally, for the longest time, you know, I watched OS 10 from a distance and I thought,
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.640]   oh, that's cool.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.480]   I like that, but I never really wanted to make the switch.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.960]   And uh, with some of the features like spotlight and some of the other, uh, new things, it's
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.760]   just, it's making more and more sense.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.520]   You know, I'm going to be contouring on this.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.520]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.680]   Now I agree that Tiger is well worth it and it's a good upgrade.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   Under the hood, there's some amazing stuff, things like SQLite being built in so that
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.640]   uh, developers have applications to a kind of lightweight data basing.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.640]   The kind of thing WinFS was supposed to do.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.320]   Um, but I'm disappointed.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.680]   I thought spotlight would be faster and easier to use.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.280]   Uh, it, you know, their usability is bad on it.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.800]   I'm used to something called launch bar.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.440]   You press command space just as you do in spotlight.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.040]   Type the first few letters of what you're looking for just as you do in spotlight and
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   then hit enter.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:38.480]   So I hit enter and spotlight instead of launching what it found, it launches itself.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.840]   The thing it found should be at the top so that hitting return or enter will launch it.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   And it's a lot slower.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.560]   It takes a second or two, maybe even longer to find the thing I'm looking for.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.440]   I just don't see, I have nothing.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.080]   I don't have that whole history with the Apple products that you do or other applications
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   to compare them for me.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.640]   Well, even X1 on Windows is so much faster.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.320]   Yeah, but I mean, for me right now, uh, good examples the other day I was trying to do
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.920]   a search for a file that was on my hard drive.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.600]   I did a search with the little dog in the corner and it took me like 10 minutes to go
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.600]   through all my data.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   Right.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.640]   And this is a huge, you know, improvement for me.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.640]   Yes, much better.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   And it's amazing.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.840]   You know, it's, it's where Windows is definitely going to go.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   Everybody.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.840]   I like the fact, everybody is.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.920]   I like the fact that it searches all the metadata.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.920]   So if you have certain type of images and things tagged with certain keywords, it'll
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   pull that information up.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.320]   I mean, it does, it does your, like everything from music to PDFs, calendar.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.960]   It's pretty, you got to admit that it may be a little slow, but it's pretty amazing technology.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.960]   It's very slick.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.960]   I know.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.740]   And the one of the things that is part of spotlight, by the way, SQLite was also put
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.740]   in because of spotlight.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.920]   One of the things that's part of spotlight is these smart folders, the ability to create
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.680]   a folder that collates information from across the desktop.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.600]   Those are really cool.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:52.520]   What I think we're seeing is a shift in the, and a proper shift in the way we understand
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.480]   information on our computer, you know, the same thing happened on the internet.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.280]   But first on the web, people tried to categorize, in fact, Sarah probably would have something
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.480]   to say about this, Patrick, as a librarian.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.840]   People tried to categorize the internet as they did the library, like with the dual,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.080]   the way decimal system saying, well, there's 16 categories and 24 sub categories and 30.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   And it didn't work.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.400]   You know, you had to, you couldn't fit everything into these boxes.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.680]   And then along comes Google and says, well, there's no categories.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.040]   Just type what you want.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.520]   Tell me what you're looking for and I'll find it for you.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.120]   And that's exactly what's happening on the desktop.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.600]   Instead of folders and folders within folders and hierarchy and organizing our mail using
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.160]   filters into different folders, forget it.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.920]   Just dump everything in there and a good search tool is going to find it wherever it
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.080]   is.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.840]   And smart folders will organize it post, you know, post fact, instead of having to do
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.240]   it ahead of time.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.520]   I think that's, that's the way it should be, right?
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.080]   There's no, there's no shelf.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   Does it?
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.880]   I really process her.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.120]   Well, that's, well, now we have the ability to do it.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.120]   Of course, yeah.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.920]   What else do you like about it, Kevin?
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.120]   The, well, the, the conferencing with the eyesight is pretty amazing.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.120]   The fact that you can do three people now, the H264 codec is just, it's amazing.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.240]   I've been doing some comparisons for the different videos.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.920]   I've been taking portions of our video that we've shot and recompressed them with QuickTime
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.560]   7 using the new H264.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.440]   And it's creating better quality videos, the same bit rates that I would typically have
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.480]   to bump up to get that, that, the type of quality.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.120]   So, how big are your file sizes?
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.480]   What kind of, what are we talking about?
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.520]   Well, we're still talking for about 15 to 20 minutes of video.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.240]   We're still talking about somewhere in the range of 150 to 200 megabytes in size.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.680]   So it's not like the file sizes are that much smaller.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.800]   It's just the improved quality at lower bit rates.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   Right.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.040]   And it is really what I'm saying.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.280]   And I mean, I'm doing it side by side, same bit rate with divots and you'll just see so
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.720]   much better at CRISPR quality images.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.760]   And not so much artifacting with the H264.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   That's exciting.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.520]   And it's a standard unlike divots, which is proprietary.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.240]   So, QuickTime 7, is it available on Windows yet?
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.000]   I don't believe so.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.480]   I don't think there's a download for it yet, but they say it's coming soon.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.280]   That will be what you'll need to do this on Windows as well.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.280]   Have you seen the trailers?
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.880]   They have four trailers on the Apple site in high def.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.880]   In HD, yeah.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.760]   I just downloaded the 1080p Serenity trailer.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.240]   It's a two minute trailer.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.080]   138 megs.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.720]   And by the way, it doesn't play back on my 1.6 gigahertz laptop.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.240]   You got to have dual two gigahertz to play this thing back.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.120]   But man, does it look good.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.600]   Yeah, it's pretty strong compression going on right there.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.880]   Robert, do you think that that's the future of, is that where video is going?
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.120]   Is it going to, instead of MPEG-4, we're going to see H.264?
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.320]   I mean, H.264 is MPEG-4.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.080]   What's the difference?
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   I don't understand.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   There really isn't.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.360]   It's enhanced video coding, AVC.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.240]   You have H.264 and basically have MPEG-4, which is the umbrella term for all of them.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.600]   So it's a subset or a superset of MPEG-4?
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:07.240]   MPEG-4 is the standard that was agreed upon by the motion picture experts group.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.920]   And 264 is really speaking directly toward the video side of things.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.920]   Got it.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.720]   What do the nice things matter about it?
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   It's scalable.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.680]   You tell it the bit rate and it does the best job it can given that bit rate.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.760]   That's hopefully that and just support for greater resolutions and things like that, especially
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   when we're talking about if you're pulling down 20 megabits streams of HD content, you'd
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.280]   like to make them more portable.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.120]   It's looking to be just one terrific format for that.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   1080p, guys.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.120]   1080p.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.920]   Most, I mean, it takes a hell of a machine to play it, but boy does it look good.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:49.560]   The extreme DVD Terminator 2 actually includes the Windows Media 9 HD version.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.920]   That's in 1080p as well.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.520]   Now how does that's what the extreme, what they call extreme Windows?
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.160]   Like the extreme DVD version of Terminator 2.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.640]   How does that come first when I saw it?
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.360]   Is it the same as H.264?
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.680]   Is it Microsoft's own thing?
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   What is the deal there?
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.840]   That is, it's their own flavor.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.760]   It's essentially they are using a next gen codec, very similar to what MPEG-4 is doing, but
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:13.680]   it's Microsoft's proprietary, their own software basically for the encoding.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.680]   So that's...
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.880]   But now they have real-time hardware encoders.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.400]   That was the cool thing I saw at the cable show here in San Francisco about two weeks
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:26.520]   ago was the fact that they now have one U-Rack Mountable, either H.264, Windows Media 9,
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.960]   real-time encoders, or MPEG-2, and you can deliver.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.800]   So I think cable companies themselves will be...
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.640]   It'll make their transition not only to digital, but just to maintaining backward compatibility
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.440]   with people who don't have HDTV yet, yet for the new customers who got by the latest and
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.920]   greatest, they're going to be able to deliver the good content.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:52.800]   And I'm hoping to see formats like 1080p just become a default for a lot of content and
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.960]   then you can scale it down from there if you need to.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:01.600]   Now no TV or very few TVs out there are going to support it right.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   I mean, 1080p...
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.400]   Oh, most any flat panel LCD that's greater than say about 40 inches is usually 1080p.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   P.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.400]   P.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.400]   As in 1920 by 1080.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.400]   Okay.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.400]   And that's because it's resolution.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.280]   Yeah, they tend to have high resolution.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.240]   For plasmas, you don't see 1080p until you hit about 70 inches, which that's still in
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   the...
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   That's the 40 grand version.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.880]   Yeah, 40, 50, 60 on up.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.440]   But I'll tell you, it's beautiful.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   It's beautiful.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   Oh, guys.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   What have you seen outside of the DVDs?
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.200]   I mean, most of the stuff that I get broadcast to my house is either 720p or 1080i.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.640]   Are we going to see broadcasts start coming out in 1080p?
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.440]   I highly doubt you're going to see the broadcasters to punch it for a while because of the additional
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.120]   costs involved of supporting it in another format.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.760]   And right now it was hard enough just getting people to wrap their heads around what is
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.240]   high definition.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.680]   And then you see a lot of movie transfers being done at even greater resolutions.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.280]   So if I have a display that's capable of it, I would hope that in the specs coming up
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:07.520]   for the new DVD formats, the high definition DVD in Blu-ray, I'm hoping it'd be really
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.960]   simple just to create a 1080p format for you if you have the hardware to do it.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   By the way, Kevin mentioned that was one of the things you wanted to talk about.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:21.400]   Finally, we're going to see maybe an HD DVD format that is compatible with both HD DVD
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.400]   and Blu-ray.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   Yeah, I'm excited about that.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.840]   Did you hear that, Robert, about Sony and Toshiba are supposed to be teaming up to unify
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   the new format?
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.520]   When I was talking with Pioneer, basically, it was all...
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.160]   It's going to become just like the format war was with DVD right now where you have plus
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.760]   and dash formats.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.560]   They're basically going to make pickups, laser pickups that'll support all formats and they
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.560]   just don't care.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   They just want to build devices.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.800]   So, if it's going to be two, three, four formats, so be it.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:53.160]   Hold on just a second because it looks like we've got a special guest stopping by.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:58.280]   Let me answer the phone and see if we can get him into the Skype conference here.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:04.800]   He's calling me from his Fortress of Solitude, Hyattop, the Berkeley Hills.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, John C. Devorak.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.080]   Yay!
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.520]   Anyway, we don't need hecklers.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   We got him.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   We got him.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.160]   Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, Robert Herron, all with us.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.040]   And John, I told John he could be the Bob Hope of the show.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.960]   Any time he wanted to stop by with his golf club, he's welcome.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   Absolutely.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.600]   The question is, you know, this thing is my Skype is...
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.000]   ASP cuts it off.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Oh, well, yeah.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.320]   One thing you got to do is turn everything off on the damn computer.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.240]   You're cutting off a little bit, actually, as you talk.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.720]   No, well.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   Now, John, you wrote three columns that we want to talk about today.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.680]   One saying podcasting is no big deal.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   One saying Skype is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.080]   And the most recent one saying there hasn't been anything new in gaming since first person
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080]   shooters were invented.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.120]   Do you want to pick one of those to address?
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.760]   Well, that's pretty good.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.000]   You're actually reading these once in a while.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.280]   You know why I read them?
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.760]   People send me irate mail thinking I have some sort of conduit to you saying, "Can you
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.240]   tell Devorak he's full of shit?"
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.560]   Yeah, they do that all the time.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.160]   They send it to my wife, dude.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.240]   You know, and I'm so hard to get a hold of.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   I've only had the same email address in the past decade.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.320]   So Robert is a gamer.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.640]   Robert, you want to ask any questions in Mr. Devorak here?
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   I thought some of the points were valid.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.840]   It was just when it comes to what everyone harps on in the gaming world, like a new title
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   like Half Life 2.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.480]   I honestly didn't see Half Life 2 as really pushing anything.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.160]   There's a lot of sequels, but that's true in movies, it's true in books.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.160]   I mean, John, you've written a few sequels to your books.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.160]   Never.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160]   No, I don't believe enough.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.160]   Really?
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   Is that true?
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.960]   No, I think everything should be original.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.960]   It shouldn't have been shot only.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   You've never been a fan of recycling.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.960]   Go ahead.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.440]   You never did a second edition of any of your books?
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.680]   Well, yeah, but that was...
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.920]   Oh, yeah, we lost him.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.440]   Oh, I was too hard on him already.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.080]   Can you hear us, John?
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.680]   Oh, man.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.960]   Okay, now everybody, when John comes back, let's be real nice to him, okay?
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   Actually, I think his gaming article and the one big thing is he backed on Starship Troopers,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.960]   which I just...
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.760]   It's one of those favorite camp movies in mind.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.160]   That would be about the only thing.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.560]   It was a terrible movie, but it was a good...
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.560]   It was a good...
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.560]   Nope.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.560]   We were just talking...
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.360]   The first hour of it's pretty hard to watch a lot of people.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.760]   Yeah, we were talking about how you didn't like Starship Troopers.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.760]   Oh, yeah, no, Starship...
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.280]   In fact, it was on again on H.D. the other night.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.160]   It's almost impossible to watch it.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   I'll tell you a couple of thumbs I've had because I've had fans call it...
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.760]   Oh, this isn't going to work.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.960]   I'm bummed out.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.760]   Do you think it's me guys or do you think it's him?
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.160]   No, it's because you're just in Starship Troopers.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.560]   They're Troopers.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.560]   I wonder what's going on.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   I think it's him.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.360]   We've got to get him to set up his system so it works.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.560]   This is ironic because the one thing that he liked in those three articles was Skype.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.960]   And it's the one thing that's not working for us right now.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.560]   It's got to be on his end.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.160]   We've been fine.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160]   I got paid.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   Hey, Robert, were you hit with that DNS outage?
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   No.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   Through Comcast?
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   I got hit a couple of weeks ago.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.560]   We were down for two days because of the DNS outage of Comcast.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.800]   I think that was when I was calling him to get my new service set up up here in Northern
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.120]   California is that they're advertising from an internet company was mixing up the term
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.960]   "bit and bite" left and right.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.960]   Throughout this entire ad they played over and over.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.960]   They kept saying that we're giving you 4 megabytes per second.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.960]   I'm like, "You are."
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   That's cool.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.960]   I'll take it.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.760]   I was like, "Oh, their entire print campaign and ad campaign was based around.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.960]   They couldn't get the bees right."
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.960]   And I was like, "Oh, please people."
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.560]   "Oh, you can hear me, John.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.560]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.560]   You know what, John?
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.160]   You could just type and I'll read your answers into the podcast."
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:11.560]   I think it's Windows.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.160]   We were talking before we tried to get this working.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.320]   John, I'll tell you what, hang in there.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.920]   Maybe you get it working and show up.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.520]   Otherwise, just he says the settings shut themselves off.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.680]   So maybe it's something weird going on with Skype.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   You might want to try rebooting.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.360]   I know before I says rebooting.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.360]   Ha!
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:38.840]   You know, I still have my Devorak in a can of recordings that we used on the radio show.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.640]   I could probably just fill those in.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.280]   I have about 10 quotes from John.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   I just play him random.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.920]   Hey, we'll get a good sit-down board program made up.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.640]   So, there's a nice, chot-see to watch.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.640]   Sound what?
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.160]   That's a good idea.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.080]   I bet you it's out there.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   That's a great idea.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.600]   Let's see if we can find that.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.440]   There probably is one, but there is one.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.440]   John would know.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.440]   I'm looking big at this.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.840]   Is Joe Devorak in a can?
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.040]   How did he put them out?
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:09.040]   We have some questions for you guys if you'd like to answer them from our listeners.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.240]   This is something we'd like to start doing.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.240]   Get a little more interactivity into the show.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.160]   If you'd like to send us a question, instead of trying to get you through on Skype, you
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   can see we're having trouble.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.200]   Yeah, John says, "Do you think I'm spidering around five sites right now?
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.440]   Do you think that's an issue?"
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   Yes!
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440]   Don't do anything else.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.520]   You're killing your bandwidth.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.440]   What was I saying?
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.480]   Oh, if you want to ask a question, the best way to do it, we might take live calls if we
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.960]   could figure out how to get Skype to work reliably with a lot of different people.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.640]   But in the interim, email us.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.440]   This week in tech@gmail.com, but we won't take printed questions.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.880]   You have to record your question.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.800]   Make it 30 seconds or less.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.720]   Use a microphone that works.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.960]   Record your question and we'll play them back on the show and our panel of experts will
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   answer them.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.200]   Are you ready, guys, for our first question of the day?
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.200]   Hi, guys.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.800]   Mike from the KFI chat room.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.040]   I'd like to know what you guys think has been the greatest technology failures within
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.960]   the last five or ten years.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.760]   Thanks!
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.480]   We need to vorac for that one.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.280]   Everything's a failure from vorac's point.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.480]   We've been five or ten years.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.680]   There have been so many original divacs.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.840]   Oh, yeah, that was a bad idea.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.840]   Yes.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   That was the ones where...
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.840]   I bought a unit.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.400]   I actually bought one of the players.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.080]   Yeah, I thought it was cool at the time.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.400]   Yes, it was kind of cool for a few weeks there.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.440]   I'm going to be able to buy Disney flicks in the 7/11 and watch them for 24 hours.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.400]   So you'd buy the movie and you had to have a special divics player.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.880]   And then you'd pay...
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.200]   It was connected to the phone line, right?
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.000]   And you'd give them a credit card and they'd unlock the DVD for a limited time.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   No, no, no.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.120]   Well, the second you put it in, you could watch it for like 48 hours or whatever it was.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:53.640]   And after that, you wouldn't have to re-rent it or you could buy it and unlock it forever.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640]   Oh, geez.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.480]   So, but it was kind of cool because you would pick up a disc for, you know, four bucks and
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   then you would take it home.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.640]   You'd never have to worry about returning it to, you know, a blockbuster or whatever it
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.800]   may be because there's no late fees.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   You play it, you watch it.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.040]   If you ever want to watch it again, you either play it a couple more bucks or you unlock
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.040]   it.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.040]   Well, here's the follow up to that.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.680]   I get questions periodically with people who have an entire library of divics discs and
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.800]   wondering how can they play it because it won't play anymore because there's no service
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.560]   to connect to.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.560]   You know how to hack them?
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.240]   Yeah, I didn't think about that.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.120]   So that's why they're at this right now.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.120]   Do you have any of those discs?
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.120]   I don't recall them.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.120]   Was the technical...
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.120]   No, I remember it all along.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.120]   No, it was about six months or...
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   That's what I thought.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.120]   It was terrible.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.120]   You know what?
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.080]   That's the problem with being an early adopter is like you get screwed sometimes like that
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.600]   and I definitely did.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.440]   Disney for some reason seems to be at the forefront of these bad ideas.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.880]   They also created a disc that rotted away.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.480]   Do you remember that?
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   Well, they came...
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.040]   I don't think they ever released it.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.600]   Oh, maybe they never did it.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.760]   The idea was you'd buy this at a 7-Eleven.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.760]   Same thing.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.560]   It was in a special sealed package.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.400]   It was like vacuum sealed, right?
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.280]   It was vacuum sealed because as soon as it hit the air, it would start to oxidize and
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.680]   you'd have 48 hours after that.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   It was worthless.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.520]   What a terrible idea.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.760]   So, could you use like one of those wine savers, recent tortilla, inner gas into the
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.760]   wine?
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.480]   I tried to preserve your rotting disc.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   Oh, hustle.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   What a pain.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.480]   Disney has also tried...
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   I mean, Disney...
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.160]   You know, we've come up with enough failures just from Disney alone.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.080]   Disney has also tried...
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:32.120]   In Florida, it's a kind of a Tivo box that they put on your TV and it has movies inside
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.280]   and in order to play the movies, you pay a fee and they're on the hard drive already
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.600]   and then it's always connected and downloading new movies all the time.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.000]   So it has like, you know, 100 movies in there.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.760]   And then actually been a failure?
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.040]   Well, I thought that was actually working.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   Is it...
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   Well, where is...
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   Maybe it is working.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   Is it around?
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   I haven't seen it.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   It was...
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:57.000]   You'd try the one technology where you had the box, set-top box that used over the air
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.480]   through local broadcasters and would constantly cash for you and then they were delivering
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.080]   movies right into the box for you, but it was in very good quality.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.800]   I just can't remember off the top of my head if it went anywhere.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.160]   My Tivo is my favorite technology.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   Tivo is a winner.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.480]   Although, ironically, the company is a loser, right?
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   I mean, is T...
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.000]   How long is Tivo gonna be around?
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Totally.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.080]   Well, they did make the deal with Comcast recently.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.920]   So that will at least give them a little lifeblood.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.880]   They'll be eating like a fish.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.880]   You're potted up, John.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.760]   You can say anything you want, but we just can't hear you.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.080]   John says, "Can you hear me?"
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.080]   Because I know John...
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   John's just...
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.720]   You know, this is torture for John.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   For us to be talking about this...
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.720]   Totally.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.200]   John can't get a word in.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   Go ahead.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   Try talking, John.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   We're listening.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.320]   The one thing I wanted to say was that, you know, the original laser discs were all
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.360]   designed to rot, or at least it turned out that way.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   I still have them.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.360]   I play them.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.600]   No, the first ones, the early, early ones, the ones that came out like, you know, in
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   the late '70s.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   Most of them are rotten.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   Really?
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   The giant ones.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   Real.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   Go laser rot.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.600]   That's where the term came from.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.600]   There's an example of a technology.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.160]   It wasn't a bad technology, but it didn't survive.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   I mean, I have...
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.200]   Well, actually don't forget the RCA Select Division, if you're going to go into that
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   stuff.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.280]   What was that?
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.080]   That was a physical disc that played videos.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.480]   How did that work?
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.120]   Was it like a roller?
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   It was in a car treat.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.120]   A lot of people have...
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.680]   And George Morrow used to have a huge collection of these things.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.920]   He slipped this disc into the player, and it was just spun at real high speeds, and
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.800]   it had a little needle that rode in the groove.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.400]   It was unbelievable.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.040]   It's the classic interim technology, where they've got photographs and they say, "Well,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.280]   there's got to be a way to make them do video."
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.480]   But it was only a brief one, brief fling.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.480]   I don't remember that.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.480]   I must have missed it.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   Oh, there was an advertising on TV.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.480]   You just missed it somehow.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.400]   I don't know how you could have possibly missed it.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.760]   I think you'd be right on it.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   You're like an early adopter.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.760]   I still have my laser discs.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   I have a whole collection.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   I watched a hard day's night.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.360]   You know, there's a problem with a laser disc.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.680]   This is a question for all of you guys.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.240]   Is it a digital or an analog format?
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.800]   It's an analog.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   It's analog.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   That is?
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   It only has analog out.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   How does it work, John?
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   I mean, it's not pits.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.360]   It was essentially the same as the signal that comes over the air for your analog TV.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.040]   How are you talking about laser discs?
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.160]   They encoded the RF signal.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.160]   Wow.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.960]   Well, whatever it was, it doesn't look that great.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.560]   I have to say it's a little noisy.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.560]   The audio might be better.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.400]   I've heard people say the audio is better because it was uncompressed audio.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.160]   I don't know how you can beat the audio on today's.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.320]   You've got some pretty good ears to hear the difference on that.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.800]   You ready for another question, guys?
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   Sure.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   Still.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   Another question for the Twits.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.120]   I'm really glad to see that you guys have been reunited here on the podcast and certainly
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.800]   appreciate the fact that you're taking questions from the listeners.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.640]   Mine deals with the new Tiger OS X operating system for the Mac.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.800]   In the past, when Microsoft would come out with a new operating system, it would be painfully
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:57.120]   obvious that my old existing PC hardware would never be strong enough to take advantage
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.200]   of all the bells and whistles in the new operating systems.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:05.000]   I'm thinking about buying a Mac Mini and I'd like to know whether or not it would be
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.560]   a good companion with Tiger and whether it has enough horsepower to take full advantage
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.600]   to all the enhancements that Tiger has to offer and if I'd get a good user experience
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.520]   out of those two items being put together in one package.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.160]   Thank you for all that you've done in the past.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.560]   Look forward to many, many great podcasts in the future.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.000]   Thanks so much and you have a great day.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.040]   That was a good question.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.640]   That was Wayne and Akron by the way, who is a long time fan.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.640]   Go ahead, Patrick.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.840]   You've got your hand in the air.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:42.000]   Well, the biggest problem with a Mac Mini or any other of the low cost Apple systems
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.080]   is that they just don't put enough memory in them from the factory.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:50.720]   256 megabytes of RAM, it'll run kind of.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.680]   But up the, you know, up and at the 512 megabytes or better yet a gigabyte is going
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.640]   to be a huge performance equivalent.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.640]   The answer is question though.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.920]   I mean, everything else runs just fine.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.360]   I can launch, you know, I move EHD, garage band, you name it.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.560]   Everything comes up with enough speed to where I'm happy with the performance at 1.4 to
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   gigahertz.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   How about with that?
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.000]   I'd say what's the, what processor is the Mini using now?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   It's a G4.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   It's a 1.4 too.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Okay.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   So you should be fine.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.840]   I don't notice a lot of difference to a G4 and a G5 to be honest with you.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.840]   I don't know.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:26.600]   I mean, Mac, the OS 10, 10 for the Tiger requirements or a power PC, G3 or better processor about
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.880]   you know, 256 megabytes of RAM.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.640]   You know, I think the biggest thing is getting more RAM in there, especially if you have
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.680]   a G3 or a, you know, slower G4 process.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   But I want to invite you all over to my house to watch the Serenity trailer at 1080p on
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.760]   a cinema display on a dual.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.320]   I can't, oops, sorry.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.600]   I can't do all that G4, G5 because it looks good.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.120]   What I want is a, I want a ticket to see the Serenity preview that's made fifth.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.320]   It's sold out in like eight minutes.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.080]   They're showing a pre-release, right?
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.800]   Because it's not a first of all.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.440]   Not final, but it's coming out of the movie comes out September 30th.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:07.200]   They're, they're showing a pre-release on the fifth and they were, I guess universal
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.440]   didn't expect a lot of people to be interested in it.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.840]   And the Serenity fan boards managed to literally the brown coats managed to get the things
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.600]   sold out in a matter of minute.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   What's the deal?
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   What is 10 cities?
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.480]   Why is Serenity, what is, what is the deal?
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.480]   I mean, is this high?
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.680]   Do you remember, do you remember Firefly?
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.840]   The series from Joss Whedon, the guy that created Buffy and Angel?
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.280]   I don't remember Firefly, I was in a Buffy Angel.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.520]   Firefly after Buffy and Angel or currently, it's hard to tell if this Joss Whedon's
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:39.280]   working on so many projects and I should openly admit that I am a huge Buffy the Vampire
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   Slayer fan.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.760]   So who the fucking ladies and gentlemen?
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.160]   Yeah, it's got to revel in.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.160]   Oh my.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   Yeah, holy cow.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.160]   What like tomorrow?
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   Are you through?
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:55.760]   Well, it's funny, I saw the premiere of Firefox.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.160]   I was right about the time when I first started watching Buffy and it was just, you know,
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.280]   it was, it was, you know, it didn't enjoy it.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:08.600]   It was like this really over-processed civil war western space sci-fi thing and I was
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:13.680]   like, oh, and it turns out that Fox basically changed because the way Whedon sets stuff
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.280]   up is he has character development and he has all these interlocking threads and they
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:23.320]   kind of, over the course of his season, they come to a pretty heavy climax and Fox decided
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:29.840]   they didn't like the, the pilot, the opener, the show opener that he put together to start
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.520]   the season and gave him like three days to cut something else.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.560]   So and then they showed, instead of showing the episodes in order, they showed them out
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.440]   of order, they didn't show the premiere would set up, set up all their, the pilot would
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.520]   set up a huge amount of back story.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.160]   So they basically started with episode two, jumped around in different episodes, which
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.040]   means the character development makes no sense and a lot of the actions of the characters
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:57.240]   make no sense and then they killed it after 11 episodes.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:03.040]   So it's, it's, and recently they released the DVD recently and it's like, I, I once,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.840]   I saw the, the, the pilot episode, I was amazed at how much more sense this second episode,
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.280]   which is the one they actually showed for us on this movie.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.240]   So this movie is that, is Firefly made for the movies or is it something?
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.160]   This is, this is Firefly made for the movie.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.720]   Trinity is the name of the ship.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.000]   Cause I'm trying to understand, you know, on this trailer, it says, the, the, the must
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.800]   see movie of the year or, you know, the best movie, the top 10 movie of the year, how would
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   they know that?
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   And the movie's not even out.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.560]   We're looking at a trailer for something that won't be out till September.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.240]   So they're talking about the fire.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.560]   Well, Mr. Smith is a top 10 must see movie of the year, but just because you can't Angelina
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.480]   Jill Lee and Brad Pitt.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   Well, anyway, it's a great, it makes a great trailer.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.080]   It's certainly a good way to show off your HD.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.240]   John C. Devorex says he's lighting himself on fire right now.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.960]   So maybe we should just move on to a soft emulation.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.800]   Another topic.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.840]   Unless, of course, we could get the Skype to work and we could listen to that, in which
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.400]   case it might be worth pursuing.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:07.000]   But you want to, you want another question from a listener here or anything else you
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.320]   want to guys want to mention about serenity?
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.320]   I guess going once.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.320]   Go ahead.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.600]   Anything in high definition is great.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.400]   Anybody other me see Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   Oh, did you see it?
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.400]   I saw it.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400]   I saw it.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400]   Okay.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   Got to give you a reviews.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   It was great.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   I loved it.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400]   Yeah, me too.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.400]   You're kidding.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.400]   Everybody I talked to said it was awful.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.440]   You know, I had to hear somebody liked it.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:37.320]   I think it's a lot like, I think it's a lot like the Lord of the Rings where if you want
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:42.320]   a strict reinterpretation of the text, you have read 733 times since you were six years
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.080]   old and first found the book, you're going to be like, you know, they forgot that part
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.200]   with the glass in the bar.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.000]   You know, they just forgot that part.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   You know.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.200]   And it's, but I think it, I mean, Kevin, you know, let me know if you agree with this
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.200]   or not.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.400]   But I think it really captured the spirit of the book.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.880]   Well, you know, I read the book like you did and I think it was, it was just great.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.560]   But there was a lot of people that walked out of the theater a little confused because
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   they didn't read the book.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.200]   I don't think they quite understood what was going on or took them a while to kind of
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.200]   understand what was going on.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.400]   And most of the critics said that there was no humor.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.840]   It wasn't funny in the book.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.840]   If it's.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.600]   I'm left my ad for.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.600]   All right.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   So I thought it was good.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.880]   I wish we could get John on because of all of us.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.320]   John really has the most to say he interviewed Douglas Adams many times.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:32.480]   In fact, as I remember, talked to Douglas Adams just shortly before his death for tech
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.360]   TV.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.800]   I'm a big fan from the original Hitchhikers, which is a radio show.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:45.040]   It was made into a book later and a cheesy TV series, which was the ultimate in cheese.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.480]   But I've been reluctant to see the movie.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.560]   I'm thinking, I don't want my memory spoiled.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.760]   So you say it's worth it.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.920]   I don't think anything is going to spoil the book.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.920]   Oh, no, I can't.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   I mean, it even breaks.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.400]   I mean, the New York Times hugely like I'm up on my favorite movie review site, which
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.640]   is rotten tomatoes dot com.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   I love it.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.960]   It just coagulates all the different ones.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   Yeah, it's kind of funny to read the snippets in here.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.480]   Stereveer's Lee Harmless, Disney's long and development film rendition, pasteurizes the
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.440]   books, renegade verb with typical means, special effects and gooey romance.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:24.160]   I'm going to save John's comments in this log here and put this in as part of the, it's
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.320]   just the funniest thing.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.560]   You guys are missing the fun here.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.080]   He says, do watch the TV show on DVD.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.080]   He says very good.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:36.640]   And he's asking maybe a little editorial input there on the word coagulates.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.640]   Okay.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.240]   Just thought I'd throw that in.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.080]   Let me get another question in for the twits here.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:48.920]   Hey, Leo, Patrick, Kevin, Robert Henry, Yoshi, whoever's there.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:55.880]   Anyway, my question basically is Kevin Rose, you have a Mac mini.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.800]   Did you ever do any kind of like video editing?
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.560]   I know it's kind of, you know, only on one point something gigahertz process or but I
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.280]   mean, how is it with Tiger on it and I like faux five.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.240]   I mean, how does it hold up?
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.240]   Is it worth it?
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.160]   Or is it worth me going to Mac?
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.880]   All these guys are asking Mac questions.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:13.880]   What's the problem here?
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.440]   I guess it is Tiger week, right?
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.160]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.880]   You know, as far as video editing is concerned, I really wouldn't recommend going with the
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.200]   mini just because the hard drive is only a 5,400 RPM hard drive.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.320]   You're going to have a little bit of some issues if you're capturing all that from your
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.320]   DV cam.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.320]   Can you get it?
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.320]   You could put firewire on?
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.320]   Yeah, you could.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.080]   You could go firewire, you could go USB 2 but I don't know.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.040]   I mean, for me personally, we do a lot of heavy.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.280]   We treat our video quite a bit with different plugins.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:48.360]   And so with the G4 processor at 1.42, it's probably not going to work out for us as far
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.360]   what we do with it.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.720]   If you're just looking to do little home movies with iMovie, maybe you'll probably find but
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.840]   if you're looking to do something with a little more production value, we're actually
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.080]   going to have to sit there and render out frames.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.280]   You probably want to beef it up a little bit and go with at least a low end G5.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:08.600]   I think it's more of an iMovie editor or a U of Final Cut Pro editor.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:14.760]   I'd say screw it, get the 2.7 GHz dual G5, you'll be happy, life will be rich and full
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.760]   for you.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:21.560]   My editor Keith in the background is yelling at me not to recommend it.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.360]   He's a Premiere Pro type of guy who has to stick with the PC and Windows and get Premiere
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.360]   Pro.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.360]   Well, I have to say that...
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.560]   Premiere Pro is just like an editing system, only harder.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.200]   I like it.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.800]   Premiere Pro is nice.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:38.640]   I have to say that is one area that PC has a huge advantage is the variety and power
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.280]   of the video cards available and that can make a big difference in rendering and 3D graphics
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.440]   and things like that as well.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.080]   So for rendering though, for video rendering itself, that's usually a CPU.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   That's CPU intensive tasks.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.960]   It's not going to benefit on the card there.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.480]   But I think if you're a light editor, it's going to...
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.120]   I mean, there's a bunch of people on this podcast right now that did a bunch of editing
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.240]   on G3s with iMovie and it didn't kill us.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.240]   Sure.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.800]   But I mean, you're always going to want more power but there's no reason you couldn't
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.040]   use it for that.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:11.320]   Dvorak says Premiere Pro sucks and the caller sounds like a mass murderer.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.800]   I agree with that one.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   That's Mab 631.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.280]   If you'd like to ask a question, it's not a call.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.280]   It's a recorded question.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.880]   We don't take emails either.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:29.760]   You've got to record your question and email it along to us at thisweekintech@gmail.com.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:35.240]   And we'll feature maybe your question on the air.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.320]   Anything else on your mind these days, guys?
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:44.240]   I thought one of the funniest stories of the week was Steve Jobs banning all John Wiley
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.480]   and son's books from the Apple stores.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   Did you see that?
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.480]   Yeah, that was interesting.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.080]   Did anybody get a copy of that?
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.480]   Well the new book is an out until June 30th.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.480]   I haven't seen the galleys of it.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   Maybe Dvorak has.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:00.400]   It's Jeffrey Young who's already written biography of Jobs.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.920]   This is about Jobs II Act.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.920]   It's a second act.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.000]   And if you look at the subtitle, it says the greatest second act in the history of business
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.840]   can't be much of a slam of Steve Jobs.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.160]   I don't know what Jobs is so angry about.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.840]   But that's pretty high-handed to say, well, just because of that, not only are you not
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.240]   going to sell the biography, that I can understand, we're not going to sell any books from that
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   publisher.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.200]   That includes books from David Pogue from Andy Inako from Bob Lovitis.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.320]   I mean, these are some of the superstars in the Mac book world.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.040]   All the dummies, books, always 10 for dummies gone.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.600]   I thought all Pogue's missing manual books were O'Reilly.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.600]   They are.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   They're a different publisher.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.840]   But he's written, apparently, I'm reading the article here.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.560]   That's what I thought too, but apparently he has written.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:41.960]   You know, Pogue will write for anybody.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:42.960]   So he--
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.200]   Pogue also can write more than any other human being ever met.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.360]   Pogue is scary.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.360]   I have to say.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.440]   But in a cool, I want to be like him when I grew up with.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.240]   Now, again, I wish John could be here because he says he has it on good authority that Jobs
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:51:00.320]   was not behind the decision and that the book is not much worse than the first book
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.320]   by Jeffrey Young.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.160]   So I still don't understand the decision.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.480]   If Jobs wasn't behind it, Jobs would not be behind it.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   Jobs would be behind everything else.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.920]   Have to work with a toady that then--
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   --with a jobs toady that shut it down?
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.920]   I don't understand.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.680]   I mean, doesn't Steve sign off on every single thing that happens at Apple?
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   Of course he does.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.760]   Of course he does.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:24.200]   And do you think anybody would dare do anything without Steve saying yes, especially something
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.080]   that drugs this much bad attention?
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.960]   Frankly, if you want to sell a book, this is the best way to do it.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.320]   Make it be a ban.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:36.640]   Make it be so bad that Jobs pulled all of the publishers' books from the bookstore.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.680]   Don't you think everybody in the world is going to read this book now?
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.800]   Jeffrey Young has to be jumping up and down.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.080]   The Vorex says it was a toady.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.240]   This is strange having John be.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.080]   You know what it feels like?
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   It feels like John died, and I'm channeling him.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.640]   You need a text of voice translators that can just like--
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   --body of John.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   That's great.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.800]   I will channel him.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.440]   That is just bizarre.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.120]   I can't tell you folks.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.280]   I've worked with John for years.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.720]   I'm looking at his picture, his smiling picture with a goofy hat on.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:18.120]   He's typing at me, and I feel like he's cocking at me from beyond the grave.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.560]   It's scary.
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.920]   All right.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.560]   I was just going to tell you about a random side.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.200]   I just came across.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.880]   You guys got to check out when you get a chance.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:30.360]   It's called boxedthoughts.com.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:35.600]   And it basically allows you to put in what's going through your head in a little tiny box,
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.920]   like a little 100 pixel by 100 pixel box.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.120]   And then you can only post every four hours.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.680]   So you can see people's different thought.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.240]   And it's all anonymous.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   That's cool.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.240]   You see what people are talking about.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.520]   Great, go mega.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.040]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:47.920]   That was me.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.000]   Yeah, look at me.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.520]   Very good.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.200]   Isn't that cool?
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:51.800]   It's rich in omega.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.160]   It's a pretty cool little side.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:53.680]   All right.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.720]   Let me do something here.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.360]   So how do you do it?
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.520]   Just click--
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:00.000]   So you have to sign up with a profile, then it creates an anonymous user.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.120]   These are all anonymous thoughts.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.400]   Like people are talking about how they want to break up with their girlfriends,
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.720]   but they can't tell her.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.360]   There's all these crazy thoughts floating around.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.320]   So you're 012853.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.080]   You're not supposed to know that.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.520]   It's supposed to be anonymous.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.520]   Why is telling her so hard?
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.520]   And you get to pick the color, too?
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.520]   Yeah, I didn't write that one.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.040]   Jesus.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.960]   Yeah, you get to pick the different colors.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.720]   Did I ever tell you how much I hated you?
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.480]   Oh, this is cool.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.520]   This is like the confession thing that--
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.520]   Right.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.360]   Yeah, I like this.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.080]   It's fun.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:32.840]   Remember the old--
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.520]   There was the old international confession booth.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.160]   That was very cool.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:37.480]   Oh, good.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:41.320]   I'm partial to the church sign generator.com.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.160]   Oh, I like that.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:42.680]   That's good.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.920]   You know what's cool about this?
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.880]   It's been out two days.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.560]   Kevin, this is your site.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.800]   No, no, no, I'm not.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.520]   I saw it on dig.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.840]   That's why.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.080]   This has only been out for-- this is the second day.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.920]   That just goes to show you how quick stuff gets--
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.440]   Oh, I see.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.040]   I've never heard of dig.com, but welcome dig users.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:00.240]   Good.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.840]   I'll stick this part in the middle.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.360]   This is good.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.160]   Dig is yours, isn't it?
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:04.960]   Yeah, dig's mine.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.200]   He's the--
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.240]   I surf that every day.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.120]   Isn't it great?
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:08.760]   I like that service.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.280]   Really?
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.280]   I like it.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.320]   Good.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.040]   Well, watch this.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.240]   We're going to send this guy through the roof.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.520]   That's our site of the week, boxedthoughts.com.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.960]   That's awesome.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.280]   Let's see if we can bring the server down.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.680]   He's going to hate us.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think this
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.560]   is going to conclude this edition of--
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.320]   do we really want to call it this week in tech?
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.760]   That is so boring.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:34.800]   Do you want to extend the name contest for another week?
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.320]   Maybe.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.680]   Now, what about this week in geek?
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.280]   The problem is I need to have--
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.840]   you're piggybacking on my TLR feed,
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.560]   and I need to have-- it needs to have its own feed, I think.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.240]   This thing was huge beyond belief.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.520]   I can't tell you how the servers were slammed.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.920]   Just the torrent tracker I was running was slammed,
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.520]   let alone the downloads.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.680]   I'm not downloading them directly.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.720]   We're using the Corel Content Distribution Network
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.160]   and BitTorrent, because otherwise it would be terabytes.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.640]   That's a really good response.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.040]   So John has a couple of suggestions.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:12.640]   He says the Tech Tits and Ass show--
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.480]   That'd be TTAs.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.640]   You know, Tech Tits and Ass in celebrities.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.000]   I remember celebrities--
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.080]   Tech T&A for reading.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.240]   That's not bad.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.360]   And he says the nude tech guru.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.960]   You know, he's obviously been listening to Don and Drew.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.000]   This is a podcast with a couple who
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.520]   live in a farmhouse somewhere in the middle of nowhere.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.080]   And I swear the reason it's one of the most popular podcasts
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.680]   is because they pretend-- I don't think they're doing it.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.440]   They pretend they're naked when they're doing it.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:46.720]   And she played a Jews harp with her private parts the other day.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:47.440]   Yay.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.160]   So much more information than you do.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.320]   Would you like to volunteer with us?
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.960]   Is this something you subscribe to, Leo?
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.760]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, it's strangely compelling.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.080]   You know, I've listened to a couple Don and Drew show.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.760]   I've never once caught under the idea
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.040]   that they're supposed to be naked.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.760]   Well, maybe it was just the one I listened to.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.920]   I think--
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.360]   But it's a sexy, no-holds-bards show, right?
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:14.680]   OK, so I guess we're going to--
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.120]   I don't know.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   We're going to call it "Twit."
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.880]   We're going to call it "This Week in Tech"
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.120]   just because we have to have a name.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.280]   But that's not really the name.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:26.480]   That is just the name that we give out on the directories.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:26.960]   OK?
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.440]   And we'll come up with a better name someday.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.600]   What about Geek Week, son?
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:31.400]   Do you like Geek Week?
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.800]   This week in Geek?
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.720]   That's not bad.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.240]   Geek Week.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:35.640]   The news is--
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.720]   Sounds catchy.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.080]   Geek Week.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:37.720]   For sure.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.280]   Geek Week.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.280]   Well, if we did that, we'd have to award a prize
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:46.560]   because that was suggested by looking for his name.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:46.920]   Somebody said--
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.560]   You win a box of crap!
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.800]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:55.200]   Kirk Golic, come on down for your box of crap.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.760]   See, that Dvorak says he likes "Twits."
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:57.480]   So there I go.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.320]   I don't know what he got.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.840]   See, the acronym of that is great.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:01.400]   I like that.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:01.900]   Twits?
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:02.900]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.800]   Well, Twig is this week in Geek.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:06.560]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.000]   I think Twits is--
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.120]   I was thinking Mr. Twig.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.080]   Mr. Twig.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.000]   South Park.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.760]   Gentlemen, I'm sure you have other things to do in your life.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.040]   This has been a two-hour edition.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.760]   I'm going to be editing it a little bit.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.160]   But I thank you for your time.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.520]   And again, we want to encourage those of you
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.320]   who enjoy the podcast to subscribe.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.120]   Keep it on the air.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.320]   Your $2 a month helps us do this fine programming.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.000]   I'm starting to sound like a pledge break.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.600]   I sound like you're sponsoring a child or something like that.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.280]   You're over $2.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.960]   You'll get a fine mint.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.640]   Well, and that's the other thing.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.360]   We'll write personal letters to the people that subscribe.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.360]   No, we will.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:45.800]   And you will.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.360]   Maybe.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.760]   No, we've got-- we saw it.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.840]   We have 200 subscriptions.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.560]   And I'm thrilled.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.680]   I thank each and every one of you.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.160]   We are saving your email addresses as you subscribe.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.080]   So at some point, we could do a special event.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.000]   I'm thinking a meetup.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.440]   Maybe we'll start doing some giveaways
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.760]   to people who subscribe.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.600]   I think we could do that.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.160]   We can arrange for some nice prizes.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.920]   If we need to do a meetup, that would be a lot of fun.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.800]   Be up and be fun.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.920]   Find out who these people really are, huh?
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.640]   We'll figure it out.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.280]   But there will be additional benefits.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:14.240]   But the main benefit is the good feeling
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:18.280]   to know that you're supporting this kind of un-adveritized
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:18.920]   programming.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:19.720]   Maybe you don't want to.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.640]   Maybe you'd like to take money from us.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.480]   There's no button on the page for that.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.680]   The email address this week in geek@gmail.com.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.000]   The web page is not yet up.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.080]   But at some point, it will be twit.tv.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.040]   But meanwhile, you can subscribe to the podcast
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.680]   at all the usual places.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:35.840]   Hey, guys, thanks a lot.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.320]   You guys still there?
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.840]   Going out with it.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.000]   Just cut in and out there.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:55.480]   Well, somebody sent me a fake screensavers theme.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.880]   Where did I put it?
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:00.080]   And he thought maybe we would like to use this
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:01.080]   as a theme for the show.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:04.840]   It kind of sounds like the screensavers.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.120]   But, well, let me play it for you.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:06.880]   It's pretty funny.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:12.680]   All right, guys, I have a lot of editing to do.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:16.880]   To be it or not to be.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.960]   All right.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.520]   Anyway, let's meet again here, same time, next week.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.040]   You got it.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:24.800]   Thanks.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.840]   See you, guys.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.840]   Take care, guys.

[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:52.680]   Have a great week.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.520]   We'll see you next Monday.
