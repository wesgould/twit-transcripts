[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.480]   We're back in the brick Twit house, which makes sense.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.080]   I mean, it would build this thing for million dollars
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.200]   and leave after a week.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.160]   And we have a great team here, again, all in studio with us,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.920]   which I really like.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.680]   It's fun.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.120]   And I kind of mockingly called this the couples' Twitter
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.600]   because it is.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.800]   It's two couples.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.680]   You don't mind me calling you a couple, do you?
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.720]   It's not a secret.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.360]   Sarah Lane, the host of the social hour, iPad today, TNT,
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.080]   my old friend from Tech TV.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.680]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.320]   I'm very rarely here on a Sunday.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   It's kind of fun.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.120]   It's a little quieter.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.040]   And yet there's much larger studio audience.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.540]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.880]   Yeah, it's cool.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   Everybody.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.520]   Also joining us, her bow.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.120]   Can I call you a bow?
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.640]   We've done promissoring, so yeah.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.480]   Have you really?
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.120]   Where's my promissoring?
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.360]   No, he was talking about--
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.120]   MG and I have done promissory.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.520]   MGC LeR my bow is here.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.200]   Of course, the best writer on techcrunch.com.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.720]   Don't tell Mike I said that.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.080]   And Paris Lemon on Twitter.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.000]   Good to have you both.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.480]   Welcome.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.240]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.520]   Is this your first time on Twitter?
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.360]   No, you've been on Twitter.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.920]   I've been on Twitter before, but not in a while.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.120]   So that's it's Austin.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.080]   It feels like the first thing.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.440]   That's what it was.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.120]   And then to my right, we have yet another couple.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.640]   The great Veronica Belmont from techzilla.com
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.440]   has been on Twitter many a time.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.760]   About.me/veronica.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.360]   Also the host of Sword and Leslie with Laser with Tom Merritt,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.640]   which is a wonderful show about sci-fi and fantasy books.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.120]   Yeah, we actually just saw George R.R. Martin down
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.600]   at the Fox Theater in Redwood City.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.720]   Did you get his autograph?
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.800]   Tom-- well, yeah, he was doing a book signing.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.760]   The author of Game of Thrones, Flash of Kings.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.000]   I'm just starting class of Kings, so I'll
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.160]   be ready for the next season.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.680]   Nice, good.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.760]   I love those books.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.680]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.800]   Sitting next to her, her longtime companion.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.040]   Right.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.920]   Couples twin most awkward twin ever.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.920]   I feel like Bob Newvitz.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   I think Bob Newvitz.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.480]   No, no.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.880]   This is not the couple's-- not couple's twin.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.040]   This is "Beards versus Banks."
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.280]   "Beards versus Banks."
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.120]   That is.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.080]   Look at that.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.160]   Wow, that's absolutely true.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.520]   You're on.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.320]   Ryan Black from Black from Gadget,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:56.240]   GTE.com, and of course, @Ryan.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   Yours versus Banks.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   Yours versus Banks.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   I'm Switzerland.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   I'm neutral.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   I'm all alone in the middle.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.240]   Top story today.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   It's actually the game of the week, the game du jour among tech
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   writers.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   Yes.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.240]   Who has more money than the United States?
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.720]   Bill Gates is now in the list.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.280]   Started with Apple Computer.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   Right.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.560]   Apple has $676 billion in the bank.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.960]   The US has-- we don't know what, not much left.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.960]   They're running down.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   Yeah, it was the '73.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   That was last week.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   Now it's significantly less.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.800]   Yeah, that's the amount of money they have left to spend before
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.200]   they hit the default ceiling.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.400]   It's a silly-- I mean, it's apples and oranges, as you said.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   Yeah, of course.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   But it's still great.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.760]   And now Bill Gates is worth more than the US.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.400]   Yes, there are things that these guys can buy now that the US
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.600]   government cannot.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   It's pretty funny.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.960]   But it's not like they could bail them out.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   No.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   That would go very far.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.200]   Well, we're also only talking about buying a cash.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.040]   We're talking about lending power.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   Right, right.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.080]   Do they-- stupid question.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.240]   But with this esteemed panel, somebody to know, is there still
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.320]   gold in Fort Knox?
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   Remember James Bond?
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   They came and they-- in Goldfinger?
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.440]   And they went, they got all the gold out of Fort-- is there
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.440]   still gold in Fort Knox?
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.200]   I think there is, but I think it's mainly for tourists, like to
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   see it.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.000]   Yeah, there's also a lot of gold in the New York Federal Reserve
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   as well.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Right.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Do you see die hard with the vengeance?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I haven't, actually.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.640]   But I've been pawning my gold off for years.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   Have you?
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   Gold for cash?
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   Yeah, gold for cash.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.640]   You don't really recommend gold for cash, do you?
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.640]   No, I don't.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   Please don't.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640]   It's such a rip off.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.640]   Really good rates.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.640]   I know.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.640]   I don't see the issue here.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   Why wouldn't you want to get money?
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.640]   You see hammer endorsed with capacity.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   Right.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.880]   So we're not tied to a gold standard anymore.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.360]   So we no longer have to keep in vaults the amount of gold
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.000]   that represents us.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.880]   No, when the US government wants more money, it just prints it.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.520]   And when Apple wants more money, it effectively just prints it
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.760]   by releasing a new iPhone.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   Right.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.400]   Practically, that's like basically the same thing.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   It is like pretty.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   That's a gold brick.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.240]   What does a company like Apple do if they have $76 billion?
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.280]   Is it in Steve Jobs' closet?
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.680]   Do they have it in the bank and certificates of deposit?
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   Right.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.200]   It's not just cash, it's cash and cash equivalents.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.720]   They have investments in certain things.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.200]   But yeah, I mean, like, you know, everyone's talking about which
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   company are they going to buy?
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.960]   They're not going to make any super large acquisition
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   anytime soon.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   They just don't do that.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.080]   They use it as leverage and they use it to secure a lot of the
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.400]   component deals that they need to get in order to continue to
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.720]   pump out iPads better than--
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.080]   It's not a rainy day fund.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.160]   They're not like saying, oh, what happens if we run out of
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.640]   money, we've got some in the bank.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.640]   Right.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.480]   Yeah, at a certain level, they make so much money they can't
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.520]   really spend it away.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.480]   They only spend in certain ways.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.680]   They're not going to go on a huge time.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.680]   They're not going to buy something.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   Apple has some people there.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.680]   Apple has some people.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.080]   Apple's worth more than the entire music industry could buy.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.360]   They could buy the music industry.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.760]   Well, who wants their own business?
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   Right.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.240]   And they start losing money.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.920]   That would be a mistake, wouldn't it?
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.040]   They are building that huge new headquarters.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.240]   So they're going to use money at the spaceship.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.520]   But that's not $76 billion.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.000]   That might be $10 billion or $12 billion.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.440]   I'm going to jump down.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.960]   Oh, maybe they'll open new stores.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.880]   They're doing that.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.360]   Generation of stores.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.400]   God knows they're doing that.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.320]   Apple now officially is the world's largest--
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.280]   underscore the word world, the world's largest smart phone
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.720]   vendor for a long time.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.880]   They've dominated in the US.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.200]   But never did that well worldwide.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.680]   Nokia was always the biggest.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.800]   Nokia is now, according to IDC, second place.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.000]   Which has more to do with Nokia's falling than Apple.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.920]   Well, I think the reality is this actually happened a long time
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.120]   ago.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.720]   We just didn't see it because it really depends on how you count it.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.640]   Nokia's long known for having inflated numbers
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.600]   because they consider a smartphone anything
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.320]   that runs Symbian.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.640]   So they have these really cheap, crappy phones
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.920]   that technically run Symbian, like Symbian Series 3.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.520]   Or Series 30 or whatever it's called now.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.240]   And they're not really smartphone.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.800]   No one in the US would ever mistake it
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.000]   for what we think of as a smartphone.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.640]   Hell, I bought an N8.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.680]   And that's even not much of a smartphone.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.240]   So the phones that they sell, they're not making them any money.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.280]   They've always had these inflated smartphone numbers.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.560]   They've just been slowly--
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.200]   But get this.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.480]   OK, so just to--
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.640]   OK, I'm going to hide this graph.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.080]   It's too late.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.000]   You already saw.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.160]   Ryan's cheating.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.280]   Who is number three?
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.760]   We got Apple, number one.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.680]   Nokia number two.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.480]   Who's the number three smartphone manufacturer worldwide?
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.560]   I already know this because we talked about it on TNT.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.880]   So I just won't say.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.920]   Well, that means Veronica is the only one who doesn't know.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.840]   I'm looking at the graph.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.800]   I'm not looking at the graph.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.560]   I was already--
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.800]   The graph is already open.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.480]   If this were the newlywed game--
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.560]   Samsung has been pretty big for--
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.400]   I'll be disqualified for cheating.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:32.920]   Samsung.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   No, not me.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   I just nailed it.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   You just nailed it.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.280]   You're right.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.920]   48.9% Apple--
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.320]   Oh, I'm sorry, other.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.840]   Right.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.160]   Others.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.760]   Others the big one.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.840]   Others the big one.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.800]   18.5% Apple, 17.5% Samsung.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.920]   Actually, Nokia's number three.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.600]   Nokia's number three with 15%.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.400]   Right after other.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.800]   And other, you have to assume, is a lot of the other Android--
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.520]   A bunch of Android's who are all just--
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.560]   There's a million Android phones.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.200]   And HD's in there.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.240]   Will putting Windows Phone 7 on Nokia,
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.840]   and sets, Brian, save Nokia?
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.680]   I don't think there's any.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.640]   There's no silver bullet.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.140]   Right.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.000]   Why would an analyst say that Nokia would be number one
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.080]   in a couple of years because of Windows Phone?
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.680]   Now, I think that their problems are more institutional.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.720]   It's less to do with what's running on the phones.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.040]   I mean, yeah, they have problems there.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.280]   But I think it's more cultural institutional.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.800]   They have a real leadership problem at the top.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.000]   Same thing with RIM.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.960]   They really need to cook clean house.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.920]   RIM's in trouble too.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.240]   We'll see this actually.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.600]   Tom's going to talk about this in a second.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.840]   But Blackberry has a big event in Canada, a user group meeting.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.280]   It might be the first time we see Blackberry 7.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.680]   That's what we're all really excited about.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.180]   I can see.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.120]   Everybody's jumping up and down.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.200]   Not enough to save them.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.160]   It's called Blackberry Night or something in Toronto.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.680]   Whoa.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.240]   That sounds like hard.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.720]   Oh my god.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.160]   Well, they're giving away Blackberry 7.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.040]   Well, they're up there in Ontario, so that makes sense.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.280]   I've said it on Twitter before.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.480]   I had pretty high hopes for the Microsoft Nokia deal.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.920]   So I'm still keeping my--
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.360]   Are you?
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.000]   Yeah, I'm still keeping my hopes up for that.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.280]   iPhone.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.920]   Because I like Windows Phone.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.840]   Are you an iPhone user?
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.400]   I am.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.720]   iPhone user?
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.400]   Why?
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.120]   iPhone user?
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.560]   iPhone user.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.720]   I'm the only Android at the thing.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.480]   And there's no Blackberry, and there's no--
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.400]   The thing is those that--
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.840]   I have a Windows Phone 7, and I like it.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.520]   No, I like it.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.240]   Yeah, I've used them before.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.960]   Everyone just has my mic.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.960]   Yeah, everybody likes Windows Phone 7.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.760]   They're just hard enough of them.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.760]   But nobody uses that.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.360]   And there's no ecosystem still.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.040]   So it's not feasible for a lot of people to buy.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.480]   I don't know.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.520]   I mean, is it possible that it's just
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.200]   going to catch like wildfire in the European market?
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.760]   I don't know.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.080]   I mean, I don't--
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.340]   I think that's the hope, is that all those
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.560]   Symbian system 30 users will buy Windows.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.720]   Yeah, and they'll all just turn to Windows Phone 7.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.280]   But in this time between them getting to Windows Phone 7,
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.360]   and the last couple of years that Apple's
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.160]   been making these huge gains in Europe,
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   I mean, I don't think there's going to be any going back.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.560]   The chappers.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.960]   Being on the low end, you've got Android,
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   and I know how you got up.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.160]   The chatroom's saying Android.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.840]   Why, Leo?
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.320]   Why?
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.040]   What's wrong with you?
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.880]   I love Android.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.200]   What?
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.240]   Chatroom?
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.440]   You wouldn't think the chatroom would be--
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.440]   I'd say the same thing about the iPhone.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.960]   --the angry about all of us using iPhones.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.460]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.160]   But you use the Android.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.000]   That's all I ever hear about.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.440]   Chatroom's highly unpredictable.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.000]   Chatroom, really.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.640]   I never know.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.000]   You never know which way the chatroom's in general.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.440]   Not only--
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.440]   Not only in my--
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.040]   Why is chat turned on?
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.640]   --andro-ed.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.480]   Android Android.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.360]   Android Android.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.320]   Android Android rocks.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.720]   Not only am I using an Android phone,
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.160]   but ladies and gentlemen, look what's on my computer.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.600]   Right now, it's Windows 7, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.040]   So I just want you to know, I am a maverick.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.320]   OK, now Leo, go to the next space over.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.120]   All right.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.160]   Oh, you mean the rest of it, the Apple stuff?
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:36.660]   OK.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.880]   No, I am actually-- that's a MacBook Air.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.720]   But I cleverly hide it.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.220]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:41.840]   So nobody will know.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.320]   Otherwise, it would be five apples on this table.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.820]   I know.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.440]   It's a little silly.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.360]   Is there bias?
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.480]   Do you think in the Twit panel?
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   Question two.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.120]   Bias.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.160]   In the Twit panel.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.960]   Cerulein.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.600]   Well, I do a show about iOS.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.320]   So obviously, I spend a lot of time
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.440]   carrying about Apple's ecosystem for part of my job.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.680]   So yeah, I spend more time on certain OSs than I do on others.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.200]   But I like to be on top of the newswives of all of them.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.960]   And that's also part of the job.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.960]   Oh, hello.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.460]   How are you?
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.440]   What's going on?
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.440]   Oh, sweetie.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.080]   Anybody screenshot that?
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.200]   We got a guy joining the beard team.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.120]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.440]   A little jealous.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.960]   Sorry, I was getting my iPad.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.720]   It was under the table right next to MG's name.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.680]   So what's what they call it these days?
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.960]   I find I don't use this very much anymore.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.120]   Well, it's funny because you say that on all of the Twit
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.480]   shows, except iPad today.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.800]   Well, I can't admit it.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.720]   I can't admit it on the other day.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.160]   And people email me and say, do you
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.480]   know what Leo said on Windows?
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.600]   Why aren't we used it anymore?
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.280]   Well, I don't know what your problem is.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.560]   I'm playing words with friends with my mom.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.200]   And then she said, why?
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.000]   How come I keep buying stuff from you on?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.520]   We rule, and you never get back to me on it.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.480]   I use my iPad a lot because I travel a lot.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:12:59.920]   And it's--
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.160]   Is it a good travel advice for you?
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.920]   I mean, the great travel tool.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.520]   And I've done a lot of tablet comparisons,
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.680]   with the thrive and with--
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.080]   Oh, it's so much better than anything else.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's just easier to use.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.480]   I mean, the speed and the ease of use factor
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.200]   just really makes it a really good travel device.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.320]   So that's what I use it for.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.880]   Anybody use a tablet that they like better than the iPad?
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.520]   I think it's tablets that don't do it for me.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.200]   I mean, I have the 10.1.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.240]   Yeah, I've got the Galaxy Tap 10, 7.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   I've got the thrive.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.240]   What do you think of that?
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.760]   Is that a nice--
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.040]   The OS is just screwed up on those things.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.840]   We had a--
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.760]   We had a TechCrunch didn't event on Friday,
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.200]   and we had a Duarte.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.080]   You did a mobile event, right?
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.200]   And so he took a lot of flak, felt a little bit bad for him.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.920]   Because for whatever reason, the audience
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.600]   was mainly pro iPhone and iOS.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.240]   And it's just like, I think at one point,
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.200]   someone asked him on stage, like, why does iOS look so much better
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.920]   than Android?
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.160]   He's a guy in charge of that.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.400]   And he's just-- he had the funny quote,
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.960]   like, why are Sicilians more handsome than other gentlemen?
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.840]   He just is.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.160]   Because of the fine coding.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.000]   I will say, in fairness, I don't know if this came up,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.160]   because I didn't make it down.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.720]   But the stuff that he's been working on
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.760]   will be out for a while.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.240]   Yeah, right, right.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.520]   What you see now is--
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.080]   Yeah, he's the former web OS guy.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.040]   Right, and before that he did helium, before that he did
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.920]   danger.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.680]   So he's, like, pretty well respected in the mobile
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.200]   interface.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.240]   Danger was great.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.080]   Yeah, web OS, I thought, was great.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.960]   So he's working on what?
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.440]   iOS 5?
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:28.960]   Android.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.800]   No, no, Android.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.720]   He's, like, the lead visual designer on Android.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.640]   So he's going to try to make it better?
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.480]   Yeah, I think his first fingerprints
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.400]   will be the ice cream sandwich stuff.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.040]   Right.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.760]   Just a little tip, his first major ones.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.800]   Rounded corners.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.680]   I think that makes everything better.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.360]   Well, I think the biggest problem with Android
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.400]   is just that there isn't any consistency.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.080]   There's no user interface guidelines.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.080]   There's no--
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.320]   You know, it doesn't bother me.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.280]   I like the technology.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:52.800]   Go to Android.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.120]   Well, you mean, like, the fragmentation of the--
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.040]   Maybe I have no taste.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.480]   --of Android.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.440]   I hear this all the time from you iPhone people.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.800]   I think Android looks good.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.920]   I think it looks good, too.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.320]   But you do get all that fragmentation
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.600]   over the different flavors.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.720]   And every device that comes out has their own spin on it.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.360]   And so there's not really that cohesiveness that iOS has.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.840]   But you have more choice.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.840]   So if you want a sensation, you get a sensation.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.280]   If you want a galaxy, you get a galaxy.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.080]   You have choices.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.800]   Well, I'll even admit one of my biggest problems
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.160]   with using Android tablets is that I am so accustomed to iOS
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.280]   that I expect things to work in a certain way.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.760]   And that's my own fault.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.400]   That's no downside on Android.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.880]   That's just my experience.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.440]   I will grant you that the tablet world iPads got it all over Android.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.520]   But that's the problem with Android in general,
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.200]   is that you want things to work a certain way.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.760]   And if the Android experience works in a variety of different ways--
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.840]   Then you get that problem there.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.340]   Sure.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.240]   You've got choice.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.760]   And there's that whole open argument.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.600]   But as far as creatures have it go,
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.640]   we want things to work the way that they work yesterday.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.680]   Well, and a lot of developers obviously
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.800]   started out with iOS because it was popular before Android was.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.600]   And so a lot of them now try and take their applications
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.960]   and support that over to Android.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.280]   And it's just not easy to do.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.440]   Anyone you talk to will tell you it's not easy to do,
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.360]   especially because it's just like there's
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.920]   all these different screen resolutions,
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.400]   all these different screen sizes that you
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.360]   have to try and make pixel perfect designs, which you can do on iOS.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.680]   And you can't do that on Android.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.400]   And Instagram guys still don't have an Android app.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.600]   Apple-- I mean, Google doesn't do anything to help with that either.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.720]   Like they don't officially recognize that as being a problem,
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.200]   which is a big problem.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.520]   Like they need to understand that like, yes, people
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.240]   need a little bit of help kind of unifying all the stuff
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.960]   and making a great consistent user experience.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.520]   There are a thousand things that are wrong
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.920]   that you could complain about with Apple's ecosystem.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.760]   But that's not one of them.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.920]   Very consistent, very good user experience.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.000]   And the trains ran on time in Mussolini's Italy.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.480]   But I think--
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.040]   If you have a--
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.440]   OK, you can say--
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.880]   With some Sicilian gentlemen.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.080]   And they were all good looking.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.800]   But I think that if you give me a choice between consistent design
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.560]   and a back button, I'll take the back button every freaking time.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.040]   I hate that.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:02.760]   I hate all those buttons.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.200]   I hate all those buttons.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.480]   Like I just want--
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.480]   You just go backwards.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.400]   You just go backwards.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.360]   I just want more screen real estate.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.880]   Like all I care about is the tuck--
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.040]   So the rent and display--
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.920]   All right, well, we got a new iPhone 4S5, something
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.560]   coming out September, right?
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.560]   What is it?
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.680]   What do you guys hear?
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.760]   September.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.480]   There's going to be one this year.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.240]   No question this year.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.240]   There's a new one every year.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.240]   Probably September.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.960]   It's not going to be later than the holiday season.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.720]   And it will be iOS 5, right?
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.280]   So when iOS 5 comes out, you'll get the new phone, right?
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.680]   So is that going to--
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.000]   well, how is that going to be different?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.120]   What are the rumors on this?
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.680]   You're not going to get better than a rent and display.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.840]   Yeah, the only thing for sure is that it will have a better
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.480]   camera.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.400]   I mean, that's not for sure.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:43.720]   But it will be--
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.640]   8 megapixel camera.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.600]   What do you seem to agree?
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.000]   Right.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.200]   Which is awesome.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.960]   I've passed the past for a long time.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.640]   Well--
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.160]   In fact, I--
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.560]   You already know how awesome it is.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.560]   My Nokia--
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.200]   And my Nokia N8 has a 12 megapixel camera with a Zeiss lens,
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.440]   still a crappy phone.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.840]   We were actually kind of going back and forth
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.280]   about this last night, because I was like, oh, 8 megapixel.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:04.720]   That's awesome.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.440]   And MG is like, well, how often do you blow something up
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.080]   and frame it?
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.600]   I mean, for the most part, this is all
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.520]   stuff that sounds good on paper.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.040]   But no one's really going to have much of a different experience.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.840]   You know, I know that this is not everybody.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.760]   But for me, I haven't had need for more than just 10 megapixel.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.160]   I think five.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.760]   Two.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.880]   I just want a high quality image.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.560]   Five.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.060]   Right.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.000]   No, but I don't print it.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.560]   I don't do anything.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.080]   Well, that's what I mean is that the iPhone--
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.680]   Why do you need like 4,000 pixels for a--
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.200]   iPhone looks good.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.080]   What does that do for you?
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.560]   It's not about the megapixels on the iPhone.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.720]   It's just good quality.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.080]   You want a better quality image.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.920]   The resolution at a certain point,
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.580]   it's diminishing returns unless you're actually
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.400]   planning on printing it.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:40.640]   I agree.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.800]   And that's why 8 megapixels on the iPhone 5 or 4S
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.240]   doesn't knock me out.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.560]   Will it have 4G?
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.000]   Oh.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.920]   I don't think so.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.320]   I don't know.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.280]   That's what's interesting.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.160]   I don't think it will either.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   I just don't think Apple will go for that yet.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.640]   I mean, all the devices that are out there right now,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.400]   they talk about the battery life, taking a major ding.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.360]   And everyone I know who has one, the EVO and the other ones
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.080]   out there, they just talk about how they disabled 4G
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.960]   most of the time because it's just not worth it.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.800]   Yeah, it's also about consistency of experience.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.440]   They want to be able to sell you a phone
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.180]   that you will get that speed on everywhere.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.500]   And that's just not there yet.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.900]   So it'll probably be chipsets.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.820]   Kind of a little bit less costly, a little bit more
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.100]   power efficient, network gets a little bit better.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.860]   And then they release one LTE phone for both Verizon and--
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.380]   Right.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.020]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.500]   There's an example where if you ask me, consistency
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.940]   could bite you because, yeah, in order to be consistent,
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.620]   we have to wait until everybody's got it.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.660]   And that makes it better for less sophisticated users.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.220]   But I like Apple 5 4G phone.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.780]   Yeah, but this is the same thing that people were saying
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.940]   with the original iPhone.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.400]   And then Apple was so late to the market.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.320]   It was edge.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.080]   Yeah, but then everyone is saying they
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.040]   were so late to the market with the iPhone 3G.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.840]   And guess what?
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.340]   Who cares?
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.200]   They still killed it.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.480]   I'm just excited for iOS 5 to be out and stable and ready to go.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.360]   What do you like about it?
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.960]   I like a lot about it, actually.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.600]   I really like the dropdown.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.120]   And I really like just a lot of--
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.720]   Oh, yeah, no.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:57.920]   --the new case.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.280]   --wide down notifications.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.320]   Yeah, we've had that for a while.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.920]   There's a lot of fun stuff in there.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.320]   Like editing, being able to edit--
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:03.800]   I know.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.000]   Yeah, we've had that for a while.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.840]   But done right.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.840]   But done right.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.300]   Oh, snap.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.340]   Damn.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.780]   So it's less about the hardware for me
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.580]   and more about the software integrating what you're still
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.140]   laughing at.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:15.940]   But it's teasing.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.940]   What else do you like?
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.420]   It's like the voice of the Android generation.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:20.760]   I know.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.660]   It's for the other--
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.180]   --we refer some old fart with an Android.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.180]   Don't get it on such a thing.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.520]   And you find little things that I enjoy,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.580]   like being able to crop and do more editing
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.940]   within the photos themselves.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.340]   I wish there was more metadata editing on that point.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.220]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.220]   They also have the really nice feature
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.600]   where you just double tap and you can launch right
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.400]   into the camera.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.440]   Because it's like so many times I think
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.440]   how my phone would try to do it.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.920]   I'm just that works faster for loading the camera than going
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.080]   through the menu system and just the camera.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   Yeah, that's totally why.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:46.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.720]   Microsoft Windows Phone 7.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.400]   Yeah, they had the shutter button thing,
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.960]   which Apple's also doing with the thing.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.680]   Yeah, and that was good, except that it was so wonky on--
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.520]   I forget which device I had, one of the--
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.000]   Focus?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.040]   It might have been the focus.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.920]   And when you click the little shutter button,
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.640]   it would be shaky every single time.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.640]   Like, we didn't account for that.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   Because it was too fast.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.140]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.920]   I think the same thing is actually true of iOS 5.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.480]   Does that happen?
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.280]   Yeah, you get a little bit of more on the shutter.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.920]   I know it takes the three shots side by side,
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.520]   but they've been split a lot.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.020]   Sorry.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.720]   So I get these images where I have very--
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.520]   It's the motion.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.520]   It's still a beta.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.120]   But that's a great idea to be able to take three shots
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.000]   and then pick the best, I think, is a very clever--
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.160]   It doesn't do the three up.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.400]   Well, that's what HDR is.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:25.920]   It's the next stop.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.520]   Yeah, HDR is actually combined.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.320]   It takes--
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:28.920]   On the other side.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.720]   It takes the photo three times at varying ISO's,
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.020]   so to speak, exposure levels.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:36.420]   It's like that.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.260]   Combines that-- what is that?
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.460]   That LITRO camera?
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.980]   What is the name of that?
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:40.820]   That's a clever idea.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.060]   We'll talk about that when it comes out.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.820]   I think Trey Ratcliffe's getting one of those next months.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.380]   Lucky.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:44.820]   We'll bring it.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.420]   Well, how you going to bring it?
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.860]   Speaking of HDR, he'll take some great HDR pictures.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.660]   Oh, amazing.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.460]   Hey, let's take a break.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.980]   When we come back, we're going to talk about the Airbnb rental
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.660]   that went so very bad.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.300]   I think it's actually Veronica, EJ.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.260]   I think she's--
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.740]   Yeah, you must be really upset.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.580]   --some anonymous woman in San Francisco.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.620]   I think it's Veronica.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.840]   That's my guess.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.320]   Some blogger in San Francisco.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.400]   She works in the tech industry in her 30s.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.480]   I think-- oh, she's too young.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.320]   She's a baby.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.520]   Shoot.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.760]   And I know you use Airbnb a lot, actually.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.040]   I'm a big fan.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.680]   Yeah, but you don't rent.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.440]   You only-- you--
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.040]   Yeah, I don't want anybody in my house.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   You're the guy ransacking other people's apartments.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.400]   Right.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.000]   Not the other way.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.000]   OK.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   By the way, meth was a 19-year-old meth addict.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.500]   My meth lab.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.240]   Oh, they did-- all right, well, we'll talk about it.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:32.600]   We'll talk about it.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   Stay tuned.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.780]   But that was a good tease, though.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.280]   What?
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:35.780]   I'd watch.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.380]   That's why.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.540]   I'd stay tuned.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.060]   I'd listen through this next commercial.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.900]   And I hope you will, too.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.780]   You know, if you provide tech support,
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.460]   you know that going to a person's home or office
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.900]   is a pain and a freaking ass, did I say that?
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.820]   I'm just a little bitter.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.300]   We all do it for a family and friends.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.780]   There's that great--
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.340]   I love it-- that viral video of John Meyer.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:56.860]   Mayer?
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.740]   How do you say that?
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:57.740]   Mayer.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.260]   Your body is a wonderland.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.260]   Mayer?
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:00.980]   John Mayer.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.380]   On the street outside of Carnegie Hall in New York City,
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.040]   I know Dad.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:04.560]   No.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.680]   Click the start-- yeah.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.400]   No, no, Dad.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.040]   You can do this.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.760]   You can do this.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.520]   Click the start.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.600]   It's so funny.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.800]   We've all done it.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.000]   Let me tell you, if you're in support,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.960]   you don't have time to get on the phone
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.760]   and talk your clients and colleagues through it.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.200]   That's why go to Assist Express from Citrix.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.040]   It's such a great solution.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.120]   It lets you get in there and fix it yourself.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.640]   It's very easy for you, but more important, maybe,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.440]   very easy for your support ease.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.120]   You don't want to have to be supporting the support tool.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.200]   All you do is you send them a link.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:32.700]   They click it.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.660]   It's Java.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.700]   So they have to get the little certificate.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.860]   It says, allow.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.820]   And boom, you're in.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.060]   You're fixing the computer.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.020]   You could do eight sessions at once.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.100]   So you can start to scan on one and install another,
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.460]   move to the next, move to the next.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.620]   Makes you much more efficient.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.460]   You can see what operating system are running.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.940]   That's important, by the way, not only
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.820]   because you can see what version of Windows,
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.140]   but it also supports the Mac.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.940]   So it's a cross-platform.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.180]   You can see what security software they're running.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.500]   It's so efficient that go to Assist Express users were surveyed.
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.920]   And they said, on average, a 40% increase
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.560]   in their productivity.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.160]   That's like getting two more work days a week.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.280]   Whether you're in customer support, technical consulting,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.440]   management, a software support guy, computer guru,
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.080]   like this panel here, go to Assist Express.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.760]   It'll help you increase revenue, reduce travel time,
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.440]   reduce support time, service more clients.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.900]   And isn't that what we're all about?
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.160]   Servicing more clients.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.720]   Go to try it right now.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.960]   I thought I'd get a laugh on that.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.520]   A chuckle.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.000]   That's OK.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.760]   I'll take it.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.760]   Go right now to go.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.720]   I laughed on the inside.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.480]   Go to assist.com/twit.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.240]   Please do it for me.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.820]   So I don't know why they got so much attention
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.120]   on this Airbnb story.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.120]   Oh, well, it's because it's a horrific story.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.600]   Yeah, it's everyone's worst nightmare.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.120]   Not only is it horrific, but they just
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.600]   finished a big round of fun--
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.200]   Right, the best razor.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.120]   So what happened?
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.840]   So what happened is that this woman--
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.080]   ETA is to--
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.600]   --he defeated him.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.680]   Yes.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.160]   And people doubted her existence,
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.720]   but she's since made an updated post on her blog being lost.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.200]   There was some thought.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.280]   Maybe she was working in the hotel industry,
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.160]   and might have had an extra grind.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.520]   Yeah, something's the simplest explanation.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.440]   This story was who's a specific.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:09.940]   OK.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:15.240]   So she left and rented out her apartment in San Francisco.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.280]   And she had very limited communication
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.440]   with the people that had decided to rent it through Airbnb.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.440]   Mistake number one.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:21.940]   Yes.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.840]   Oh, that's not her fault.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.840]   She went through Airbnb.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.840]   They went through Airbnb.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.040]   The amount of contact you can have with the renters
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.560]   until after the whole transaction has gone through.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.200]   So then at that point, you can do email addresses or phone calls.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.400]   That kind of thing.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.960]   So you have to accept them before you even--
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   That's how they work.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.960]   That's how they work.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.720]   And they do know privacy somewhere.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.920]   Yes, it's a privacy thing.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   They do know kind of vetting.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.480]   They do know kind of background search of any kind.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.440]   So a bad guy could go to Airbnb.com and say,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.920]   let me see what the nicest place in San Francisco is and rent it.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.520]   Exactly.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.800]   They take no--
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.520]   it's not in their terms of service
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.960]   to take any kind of responsibility
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.040]   for anything that happens.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.560]   And that is down in their TOS.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.520]   That's a flaw, by the way.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.560]   The hope is that they have enough users
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.360]   and that they all grade each other.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.680]   It's like that's a flaw--
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.520]   It's like a rating system.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.240]   The way that Yelp--
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.080]   Chicken and eggs are all right.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.240]   Oh, so it's kind of like eBay.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.240]   You can look at the person who might rent your place
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.520]   to see what their rating is.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.920]   You can also look at somebody who's renting a place
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.600]   to see if they get packed to people regularly.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.200]   It was the key, easy to find, that sort of thing.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.320]   So it's more than 90% people recommend this rent
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.080]   to your renter.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.280]   It's a little different, though, than eBay.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.600]   Because with eBay and you have a high value thing
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.080]   that you're selling and you get a first time buyer--
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:31.280]   It's just--
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.920]   Somebody who's not good on eBay, right?
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   Right.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.760]   Like they don't have the reputation already.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.160]   You go through escrow, right?
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.360]   Like they put the money in escrow,
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.120]   you send them thing, and the escrow releases,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   and everybody's happy, right?
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   So there are protection mechanisms that way.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.600]   But there's no protection mechanism
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.360]   when it comes to the object in question
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.800]   is a residence and everything in it.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.640]   Well, to make a long story short, though,
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.440]   her apartment was trashed.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.240]   I mean, beyond recognition, everything--
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.080]   They stole stuff.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.720]   They broke down a door and got into--
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.680]   They did weird stuff like mess up in her bathroom.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.480]   They took their bags out of her clothes, just to like--
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.080]   That's weird.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.520]   They're not going to get anything out of that,
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.760]   just to scare her, pretty much.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.760]   Yeah, it was very weird.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.160]   While they were messing with her like that.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.200]   Oh, you know, we're having a great time here.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.480]   Yes, sending her really polite emails back and forth,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.720]   being like, oh, there's so much light in your living room.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.800]   It's beautiful.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.840]   We're really enjoying our time here.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.280]   Well, there was until we broke all the windows.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:19.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.160]   And so she came back and she has no recourse
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.600]   through Airbnb, basically.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.840]   Because it's in their terms of service.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.340]   Right.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.480]   And so she dealt with the SFPD a little bit.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.240]   But then Airbnb released a statement saying,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.880]   you know, we're really sorry this happened.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.960]   We've been working with this person very closely
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.080]   to try to figure out how we can help her, you know,
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.840]   get the person in custody, figure out
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.000]   how we can make her feel safe and secure.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.440]   But she later came back and said that after June 30th,
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.000]   all heard communication with the customer representatives
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.520]   at Airbnb stopped after she posted her first blog post.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.080]   Now, that date is significant because it
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.400]   was after the blog post, but before their funding round.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.760]   I guess that was it, really?
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.920]   So yeah.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.120]   So yeah, this was about a month ago.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.360]   So this was the theories that, well,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.760]   we want to shut this thing up because we got a funding round.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.160]   And I guess one of the co-founders actually called her
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.360]   and talked to her a little bit and was like,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.600]   we'd really like you to take down this blog post.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.320]   We'd really like you to censor this.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.560]   They didn't say censor, but, you know, put it behind a wall.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.640]   Do us a save her.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.040]   Yeah, secure it, lock it down.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.160]   And she was like, no, I'm not going to do that.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.520]   And that's kind of how-- he said she said now between Airbnb
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.000]   and this person, this quasi-anonymous person.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.800]   She obviously doesn't want her real name out there
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.440]   because she doesn't want any kind of more privacy
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.760]   invasion than she's already going through.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.880]   But they say they had a suspect in custody,
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.960]   yet she hasn't heard that from the SFPD either.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.320]   So on her end, everything is still as it was a month ago.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.400]   Yeah, Airbnb pretty much said there's
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.120]   somebody in custody, but because it's
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.680]   an ongoing investigation, we can't tell you anymore about it.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.240]   Even though this is her home--
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.000]   And these are people that were in her home.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.560]   Isn't there also this whole side show with the situation,
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.920]   with TechCrunch 2?
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.360]   And like--
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   Yes, all the--
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   All the--
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:58.860]   Exactly.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.360]   As always.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.720]   Mike got involved a little bit.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.200]   Right.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.280]   Well, yeah, because there was some name calling.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.440]   Well, not that anybody would call Mike a name.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.320]   I mean, I don't want to get too into this.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.360]   But as I understand it, I haven't really even
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.240]   followed it that closely.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.840]   There was stuff that happened yesterday
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.120]   with a paulgram of Y Combinator who--
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.480]   It was the funders, one of the original backers of Airbnb.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.600]   And by the way, a huge supporter of Airbnb.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.960]   Yall's been going around saying, this
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.280]   is the next big thing.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.520]   This is going to be bigger than eBay.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.240]   It disrupts hotel chains--
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.200]   Well, I'm starting to hate that word.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.680]   Yeah, well, it changes business.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.960]   No, I know what you're meant to me.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.840]   But it's a nice plug.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.280]   Well done.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.440]   It's just--
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.920]   No, but so it's another--
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.520]   it's another he said she said thing.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.600]   I mean, it's just now like--
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.480]   I guess Paul Graham wasn't so sure of the validity of what
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.800]   Mike said the people from Airbnb had told him.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.560]   And he's saying, absolutely, that's what they told me.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.400]   And we went back and forth even.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.040]   And so now it's a whole other thing.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.480]   Actually, he just wrote another post
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.800]   that I'm looking at right now.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.760]   Yeah, just another Airbnb victim tells his story.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.280]   There were meth pipes everywhere.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:11.760]   What?
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.720]   This is a separate person.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.360]   What is going on with these meth people on Airbnb?
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.080]   Well, think about it.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.520]   It's the perfect ruse.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.800]   You can rent a place for a short amount of time,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.920]   basically do whatever you want, and they can't track you.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.200]   So instead of having your regular meth house,
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.000]   you can kind of spread your--
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.440]   I don't know.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.560]   Right, it's not like you have to--
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.520]   I have to look somebody in the eye at the hotel.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.320]   No, it works right.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.400]   Before you go into the room.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.960]   So Airbnb is one of the reasons it's a tech story.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.920]   It's really a darling of the startup world.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.680]   They just raise $112 million over--
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.200]   Totally, totally.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.360]   --a billion dollar valuation.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.520]   We have used Airbnb--
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.040]   We've used it.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.560]   It's great.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.560]   --as renters successfully.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.200]   I was impressed.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.520]   You went to Paris last December.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.120]   You got a much better place across the street
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.880]   from the very expensive hotel I was paying for.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.720]   You got a much better--
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.440]   We paid about-- it was like $100 a night.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.160]   $100 a night.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.920]   $400 for somewhere in France.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.320]   It's amazing.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.720]   And I've been looking into it for a trip
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   that I'm taking with some of my girlfriends in the winter,
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.680]   out of the country.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.400]   It's the same thing.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.360]   I've been like, oh, Airbnb.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.160]   This will be perfect.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.320]   We can rent a little cottage.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.560]   We can have a great time.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.080]   Not have to deal with the hotels.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.640]   And now I'm like, oh, I don't know.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.400]   Even though I'm the one who's doing the renting,
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.080]   I still feel very--
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.440]   I think it'd be OK to be a renter.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.160]   Well, hey, crazy is all over the place, right?
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.360]   I mean, somebody who's--
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.440]   So I guess really--
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:25.880]   --that's true.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.720]   You can be renting something out as well.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.080]   And maybe you get to Costa Rica and you can't get in.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.520]   That would be bad.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.600]   The house doesn't exist or something like that.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.640]   But that happens to anybody on a home exchange.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.400]   Or they can happen any time.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.200]   I feel like this is--
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.400]   It looks very bad for Airbnb right now.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.600]   But I think that this will pass eventually.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.320]   It's very much a chicken and egg problem, where it's just like--
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.600]   they don't have--
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.880]   they have so many first time users of this service.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   And it's just--
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.760]   They're a rating thing.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.200]   And they've already talked about things
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.000]   that they're going to change.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.080]   They're going to offer insurance now.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.440]   They're going to have other things.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.000]   Well, also like Craigslist, for example,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.520]   one of the points that EJ made in her post was that if I did
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.840]   this on Craigslist, I would be reminded time and time again
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.280]   that this is on my own--
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.280]   Yeah, watch for fraud.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:07.720]   --this is me.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   Watch for fraud.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   Do this on your own.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.920]   It's not-- we take no responsibility for what happens.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.840]   She felt like she wasn't sufficiently
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.400]   warned through Airbnb, which is not--
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.640]   It's also slightly different, too, because Craigslist
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.320]   is kind of like a standard for classifieds,
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.400]   whereas Airbnb is actually a marketplace.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.320]   And the marketplace aspect, the exchanging of money,
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.880]   the reputation system, that creates different expectations.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.880]   And yeah, Airbnb absolutely needs to step up here, thank you.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.960]   One of the things I think that plays into this a little bit
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.240]   is-- so for example, the place that we rented last December
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.120]   in Paris, it worked out really well for us.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:44.620]   OK.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.040]   We were there for just a few days, and everything was fine.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.600]   We never met the person that rented it out,
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.440]   but we had--
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.240]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.040]   --the key was where he said it would be, and it was fine.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.160]   It was also pretty obvious that he didn't live there.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.240]   It was some sort of a sublet situation.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.040]   And I've spent a lot of time trilling Airbnb, because I do--
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:01.540]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.040]   Ooh, that's good.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:02.540]   I Berlin.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.200]   And what are my options there, that kind of thing?
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.560]   So I've looked at a lot of apartments.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.560]   And you can kind of tell that a good amount of them
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.120]   are not actually lived in by anybody.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.880]   It's some sort of extra-- maybe it's something
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.720]   that somebody owns, and they're trying to get--
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.840]   pay their mortgage on--
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.400]   And their legal situations around that in the United States.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.120]   That too.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:19.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.680]   I mean, a lot of landlords are really scared of Airbnb,
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.400]   because they don't want people subletting,
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.160]   because that's usually not a kosher thing to do.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:30.680]   But I think that Airbnb is--
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.400]   they're well aware that for the--
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.960]   well, not for the most part, but a large amount of people
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.120]   are not actually renting out places where they live,
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.640]   and their coffee's in the cabinet,
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.880]   and their underwear's in the dresser.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.960]   Well, that's typical of a vacation rental in general.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.640]   It is.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.520]   But the problem is that some people are.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.280]   I mean, this was actually someone's home,
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.800]   where she had all of her personal belongings.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.840]   And apparently didn't secure them very well.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.880]   No.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.600]   Is it kind of like a zip car or these--
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.080]   I mean, right now, zip car--
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.960]   It's more like the get around thing than zip cars.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.080]   I'm just saying, because zip cars are so small,
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.360]   and it's used by a small group of hipsters--
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   No one owns the car.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.560]   It's a zip car.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.840]   But I'm saying, it works right now,
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.960]   because it's a small group of kind of tight hipsters,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.360]   and so it's OK.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.360]   What's that?
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.360]   What's that even mean?
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   It's like--
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   It's like--
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   OK, follow me here.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.360]   It's like--
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.360]   Yeah, you're hipsters.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   There is some beat mix using it.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.360]   Zip car has background tracks.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.040]   It's used by people with bangs and beards.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   OK?
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.360]   I'll be on this.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.560]   No, but I mean, it's kind of like a Google+.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.160]   It's used by a small group of kind of--
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.760]   have a certain socioeconomic level.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.400]   As soon as it becomes public, I wonder
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.160]   if Airbnb's model sustains, in other words.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.880]   Just in the same way, I was wondering if zip cars model
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.560]   sustains as soon as the--
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   I really think--
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.560]   I mean, I think that if they get big enough,
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.560]   if they keep growing, that would be what we've seen now--
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.560]   The ratings help.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.560]   Yes, the ratings help.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.560]   They'll have other ideas that they're already trying to implement.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.960]   They had a thing that's actually pretty smart that they did before this.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.960]   Obviously, it didn't help here.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.760]   But they have a good Facebook connection
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.160]   where you can tell if there's a second degree connection
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.760]   that you know someone who's rented this place before.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.760]   Like a sonar, technical thing.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.160]   It's like a situation, yeah.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.160]   I mean, the fundamental issue is, though, you have to just--
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.560]   at the core level, you have to believe that someone's not going to be a jackass
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.560]   with your apartment.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.560]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.760]   People aren't evil.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   But people are evil.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   She's also--
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   You're just-- because you're extra-resiving it, Sarah.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.760]   All right, we don't think people are evil.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.360]   She also said, going back through the email correspondence
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.360]   that I had with this person, these people,
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   there was a funny name spelling.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   Things were said that were weird.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.360]   And of course, in hindsight, that happens a lot where you go,
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   gosh, I should have known, I should have trusted my intuition
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   that something was a little off-hair.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   So she even says, there was something off.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.360]   I just wanted to believe it was going to be fine.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.360]   I guess the real reason that Airbnb gets these big value--
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.360]   there's a billion dollar valuation-- is because people think it will compete
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   with travelocity and travel agents.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.360]   And it is.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.360]   It essentially could be against hotels.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.360]   And in fact, Airbnb really doesn't start taking off until hotels.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   Start using it in addition to vacation rentals, right?
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.360]   That's when-- that's, I think, what the model is.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.360]   You don't get to a billion dollars unless people book all their hotels.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   What do you mean their hotels start porting their listings through Airbnb?
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   That's when you become valuable because every--
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   You go there for whatever your need.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.360]   Right.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   They use it because they have openings and they just want to put it in there.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.360]   Yeah, I mean, that's obvious to do that.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.360]   I'm sure that's what Paul Graham and the other investors are thinking.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   I just don't understand why Airbnb didn't take this really bad situation.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.360]   They should have been much more awesome.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   As a great opportunity for PR.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   I mean, they could have handled it.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   They could have made a big deal out of this and how they were going to help this woman restore her--
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.360]   not only her ransacked home, but her trust in the company.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.360]   And instead, they did this sort of weasily.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   Please take your book, you know, stuff.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.360]   There was a great comment on it on one of the sites.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.360]   It may have even been one of the TechCrunch posts that was like,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   they could have flipped this around because at the end of the day,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.360]   when you go the extra step to help a customer like this,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.360]   they're going to remember it in a really good way.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   And that's what's going to be out there.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   But if you screw over a customer, they're going to blow that up three times what it originally was.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   And remember that forever.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   But it's because of blogs and social media that's customizing megaphone.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   And it's amplified.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   I mean, how they thought this wouldn't get out there in one way or another.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.360]   The thing that Airbnb is like, the moment you hear the concept of what they do,
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   you're like, "Oh crap, you know, I'm going to do this and my place is going to get trashed."
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   Right?
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   That's the thing that you kind of like--
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.360]   That's why I want to write out my place.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.360]   And then I'm like, "Oh, that's why I'm not going to do this."
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's why I want to write out my place."
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's why I want to write out my place."
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's why I want to write out my place."
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.360]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's why I want to write out my place."
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.360]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's why I want to write out my place."
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's why I want to write out my place."
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.360]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's why I want to write out my place."
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.360]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's why I want to write out my place."
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.360]   What an idiot, didn't-- I mean, of course this is going to happen.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.360]   What a surprise, right?
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.360]   So it's going to happen.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   So it's like--
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   You want an idiot that's in the other house?
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.360]   Why are they not better prepared for this?
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.360]   Right.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.360]   Well, an Airbnb, clearly.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   I mean, that is the lesson.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   Handle it badly.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.360]   They should have done a Discovery Channel home makeover and made a big deal out of it.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.360]   Exactly.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.360]   They should have said, "We are going to turn her house into a palace."
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.360]   I think they did in the long run.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   They rebuilt it.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:23.860]   Yeah, but then there are these other flip sides of that, which is then you're going to get
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.860]   a bunch of sketchy people renting out their place and then trashing it.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.860]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   And then trashing it and then expecting your big pickup to take you.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   You have to really care for your exception.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.860]   See, he's really cynical.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860]   See, I'm so sick.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.860]   Yeah, look, people try to give themselves a back.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.860]   Is there a problem you're talking about?
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:38.860]   Let's not try to--
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:44.360]   There was also MG's colleague Paul Carr wrote up a really interesting article over the weekend
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:51.460]   about the idea that because of the way this market is for services such as this that are
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.180]   very dependent on ratings and social.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:57.700]   And it's a competitive place right now.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.300]   If you're going to be successful and you're going to have a grand exit and you're going
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.540]   to make a lot of money, you have to have a lot of users.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.220]   And when you start talking about users in the millions, you start thinking about those
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.860]   users less as people and more as data.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.980]   And when that happens, this is not an evil company we're talking about.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:16.300]   This is just the way that you have to start thinking about your user base, not so much
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.060]   as people but as statistics.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.260]   And then you get into trouble.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:24.260]   And then you get into trouble when you're talking about someone's personal belongings.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.260]   Good point.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.740]   Because it isn't really.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.740]   Right.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.740]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.940]   But a good lesson, I mean, you would think that lesson would be well learned by anybody
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:37.860]   in a startup these days is that social media can kill you, blogs can kill you, be very aggressive
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.140]   and proactive when something like this happens.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.740]   It costs you a lot less to do that.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.060]   We're going to take a break.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:47.540]   This is a great-- I feel like we're at a great dinner party, but we just don't have any
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.540]   food or beverages.
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.780]   Well, we can fix that up right quick.
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.780]   Right.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.780]   Right.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.780]   Right.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.780]   We're going to pick from GDGT is here.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.500]   Well, I've got a surprise for you.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.500]   We've been roasting a pig.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.500]   Oh, dear.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.060]   I'm already ordering pizza right now.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.060]   You could.
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.060]   It's coming in any moment.
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.060]   And I think people know the address.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.540]   And so I imagine it won't be just you but thousands of people all over the country.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.460]   That's what I'm waiting for.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.700]   What is Twits Airbnb fiasco going to be?
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.540]   A hundred pizzas arriving at the door?
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.540]   No, you said that.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.540]   You just said that.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.540]   Please don't do that, please.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.540]   Please.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.940]   Please don't do that.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.700]   Ryan Block is here from GDGT.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.540]   What do you guys got going on?
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.700]   Any new-- you got to redesign.
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.700]   Looks beautiful.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.700]   Thank you.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.700]   What else is that?
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.180]   Just working on a whole bunch of new features for ladies here.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.180]   I love it.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.180]   Great site.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.180]   Really, really, really busy.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.060]   So the social of gadgets, gadgeteering, really enjoy it.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.060]   Okay.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.060]   Also Veronica Belmont from Tekzilla.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.460]   You know, we had Patrick on last week.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.460]   I know.
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.940]   It's kind of-- we should someday get both of you on.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.660]   Well, we're going to get you out of the cottage sometime.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.540]   I've never been to the revision three studios.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.540]   Get out, really?
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.540]   I didn't-- you know, I wanted to do this in a clean room environment.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.540]   I didn't want Jim Latterback to say, "You stole everything."
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.540]   So I-- now I can go.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.540]   Now I can go.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.540]   I really don't.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.540]   I really don't.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.540]   I really don't.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.540]   Jim has been called out.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.540]   Also, here's Sarah Lane, who has been around the Twit Brickhouse for a while.
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:08.540]   She, of course, one of the founding members of Twit, and is always good to have Sarah.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.540]   She's on TNT.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:15.540]   Every weekday, 230, or when Leo gets around to it, Pacific time, 530 Eastern.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.540]   They're laughing as if they knew.
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.540]   It's funny to see--
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.540]   It's funny to see--
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.540]   It's funny to see--
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.540]   Well, we were in a new studio.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.540]   So there were all sorts of technical things to work out.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.540]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.540]   In a couple of weeks, we'll be back to just Leo running long.
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.540]   Sarah said-- thank you.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:30.540]   Thank you very much.
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.540]   Yeah, I don't care.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.540]   It's Tom.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.540]   Sarah said a funny thing about iPad today.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.540]   And I think it's true of this too.
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.540]   She said the lighting looks to-- what do you call it?
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.540]   Primetime.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.540]   Primetime.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.540]   It's like to Moody?
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.540]   Like, it looks like CSI in Los Angeles?
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.540]   What are you talking about?
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.540]   Well, when I say primetime, I don't mean that shows on Primetime market shows.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.540]   It has a--
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.540]   It's modeled.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.540]   Nighttime shadow-y look.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.540]   It does feel like it's nighttime when you look at the--
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.540]   Yeah.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.540]   Now, I have no problem with that, but it brings out--
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.540]   I don't know--
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.540]   You feel like a vampire when you--
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:07.540]   Well, I just don't know if it works with an often light, hard-on-nature of our programming.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.540]   Right.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.540]   Right.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.540]   New should be more brightening.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.540]   It's a little-- yeah.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.540]   It's just something that I noticed.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.540]   Well, it's been a while.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.540]   You're not alone.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.540]   The chat room-- the chat room said it's a little dark in here, and we do have to put more--
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.540]   We have not done it.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.540]   It looks like CTU.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.540]   Someone said that's kind of--
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.540]   What's CTU?
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.540]   From 24.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.540]   Oh.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.540]   The counter-terrorism unit thing.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:26.540]   Right.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   It does.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.540]   This is a little bit.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.540]   And they're all using that.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.540]   They just started interrogating each other.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.540]   Where are you?
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.540]   M.G. Seagler's also here, the great writer for TechCrunch, which just got the new 8-bit redesign.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.540]   I don't know what to do.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.540]   We did.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.540]   We did.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:41.540]   I'm sure you had nothing to do with that.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.540]   That was all Ariana's doing.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.540]   Right.
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.540]   I love it.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.540]   I love it.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.540]   I know there's been some criticism, but I think--
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.540]   No, I love the design.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.540]   You had everything to do with it, didn't you?
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.540]   I did.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.540]   See you there you go.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.540]   That's how I work.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.540]   No.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.540]   You did really--
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.540]   All I care is that it's so much faster than it was.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.540]   Did you move to Word Press?
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.540]   It doesn't crash my browser anymore.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.540]   It doesn't crash browsers anymore.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:02.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.540]   We've been on Word Press for a while, and we're staying on Word Press.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:09.540]   We were gonna-- there's talk of what we're gonna transition to behind the scenes, of course.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:14.540]   You know, there's the web log stuff going on, and then the Hoving Post runs on.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.540]   I think it's their own custom version of--
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.540]   That's the last thing you want.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.540]   --type new Google type.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.540]   Right.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.540]   Well, this is not funny because Boing Moing just moved off MoveableType to Word Press.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.540]   Right.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.540]   Well, I love Word Press.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.540]   It's great.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.540]   I think Word Press is fun.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.540]   It's amazing that Word Press can handle sites with this kind of trend.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.540]   It's the Word Press VIP.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:32.540]   It's insane resources.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:33.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.540]   They're out of control.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.540]   We're doing some good stuff.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.540]   Oh, you mean you're on WordPress.com?
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.540]   No.
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:39.540]   Yeah, it's the WordPress.com VIP.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.540]   You're on their server.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.540]   Wow.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.540]   You would think AOL would have changed that.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.540]   They've ever talked of it, but yeah, we just decided for now we're gonna stick with this.
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.540]   If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:51.540]   It is fast.
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.540]   It's really fast.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.540]   Much, much faster.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.540]   And I noticed that because I'm always pulling up articles from TechCrunch.
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.540]   And--
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.540]   Good.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.540]   Yes.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.540]   This is the best.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.540]   I love it.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.540]   Even that Mike Harrington guy.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:06.540]   I was waiting for somebody to buy a brick that says screw you, Mike Harrington.
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.540]   But nobody did.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.540]   It's not too late.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.540]   Well, they live now.
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.540]   It's not too late.
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.540]   [laughter]
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.540]   Mike, you're intentioned by a brick and say whatever he wants to say.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:15.540]   Screw you, Leo, look forward.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.540]   There you go.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:17.540]   Hang it on the wall.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.540]   I would put it up.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.540]   If Mike did that, I would put it up.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.540]   I'll tell him.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.540]   All right.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.540]   Say screw you, Leo.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.540]   You're such a troll.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.540]   [laughter]
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.540]   That would be great.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.540]   You're gonna picture a troll face underneath.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.540]   I would love that.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.540]   That'd be fun.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.540]   That'd be hysterical.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.540]   I'd go for that.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.540]   I'd go for that.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:32.540]   And let's take a break.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.540]   We're gonna come back with more with this excellent panel.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.540]   I don't even want to say it.
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.540]   The couples version.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.540]   I shouldn't say it.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.540]   Bears versus bangs.
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.540]   Bears versus bangs.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.540]   Let's go to Berlin.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.540]   And I am Switzerland.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.540]   But first, let's talk about backup.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.540]   Backup done right whiz.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.540]   You know, I hear them singing at home.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.540]   Carbonite.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.540]   Carbonite.com is online.
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.540]   It's kind of an eight story.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:58.540]   The guy who started it, David Friend, got out of, he was a Yale graduate.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:03.540]   I think went to graduate school at MIT, got out of school, and built the ARP synthesizer.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.540]   Had a great company.
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.540]   ARP, remember ARP?
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.540]   Every rock and roll band in the world used ARP.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.540]   He just had a great life.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.540]   Retired.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.540]   Said, "I'm done.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.540]   I'm gonna take it easy."
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.540]   One of those entrepreneurs who said, "I'm happy."
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.540]   And then his daughter, who's in college, calls him and says, "Daddy, I just lost my term paper.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.540]   I've got no backup."
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.540]   And he thought, "You know, there really has to be a better way to do this."
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:29.540]   And he got back in the game and created Carbonite, an online backup service that backs up your
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.540]   data wherever you are, whenever you're online.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:39.540]   It uses 128-bit SSL, so it's safe to use it in open access, spot-like students use at coffee shops and stuff.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.540]   We're at home.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:46.540]   You can encrypt your data further using strong encryption, so your privacy is guaranteed.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.540]   And the price is right.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:54.540]   I actually put it on, it's funny, it goes full circle because I put it on my daughter's computer when she went to college, so that I wouldn't get that call that David got.
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.540]   Unlimited online backup, $59 per year per computer.
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.540]   That's less than $5 a month for everything on your internal drive.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.540]   And I'm telling you, you don't ever have to think about how much data I have.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:05.540]   You just back it up.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.540]   And you can get to that data anytime, so it's cloud storage too.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.540]   So you can go to your Carbonite account on a Mac or PC.
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.540]   There's your stuff.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:16.540]   They also have smartphone apps, iPad, iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, even.
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.540]   So you always can see your data.
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.540]   It's cloud storage, unlimited cloud storage for $59 a year.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.540]   You know, compare that to Dropbox or anybody else.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.540]   You'll realize what a good deal that is.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:28.540]   It's also very easy to restore.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   That's important.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.540]   And you can try it free for two weeks right now.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:36.540]   Go to Carbonite.com and use Twit as the offer code.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.540]   C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E Carbonite.com offer code.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.540]   Twit, they've been a great supporter of Twit.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.540]   David is a great friend.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.540]   David Friend is a great friend.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.540]   It sounds a little strange, but it's true.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.540]   And I really appreciate their support for everything we do here at Twit.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:59.540]   I strongly encourage you to check out Carbonite for your backup needs moving along to, let's
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.540]   see what else we got here going on.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:06.540]   Google+, I hate somebody sent me an email saying, "Stop talking about Google+, it's not public."
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.540]   And yet there are what, 20 million people on it?
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.540]   I mean, it might as well be public.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.540]   Is there anybody?
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.540]   Let's ask our studio audience.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.540]   I'm still meeting with people too.
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.540]   There's 25 people in the studio.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.540]   How many of you are on Google+, everyone?
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:17.540]   Pretty much everyone.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.540]   There's a few not.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.540]   Who wants an invite in the audience?
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.540]   Anyone?
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.540]   If you're in the studio, we'll give you an invite.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:30.540]   There are definitely people still asking on a daily basis for invites.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.540]   So people are not able to get in, I guess.
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.540]   Lawrence Hubbard, we asked on Google+, ironically.
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.540]   Eileen Rivera, my producer, said, "Well, what do you want to talk about on Twit?"
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:43.540]   And one of the things that Lawrence Hubbard on Google+ said is, "What are the pros and cons
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.540]   of opening up to the public?
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.540]   It's still in the field test state."
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.540]   This is kind of the Airbnb issue, the Zipcard issue.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:55.540]   What happens if everybody's on Google+, is this suddenly Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber,
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.540]   and a bunch of people you don't care about?
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.540]   I mean, Google could have opened this up right away.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.540]   They certainly have the infrastructure to be able to do that.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.540]   It's stable enough.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:08.540]   I think that what they wanted to do was, first of all, it's been good for buzz, not buzz the
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.540]   product, which sucks, but other buzz.
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.540]   Industry buzz.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.540]   It almost feels like Buzz 2.0.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.540]   Like they learned a lot of lessons from Google buzz.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.540]   I'm just waiting for them to fold it in, so buzz is gone.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.540]   Kill buzz, please.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:20.540]   Buzz kill.
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.540]   Wait, it's not already gone?
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:22.540]   No, it's not.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.540]   No, it's not.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.540]   It's like, yeah, it's part of Google+.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.540]   It's like the living dead.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.540]   It's like a zombie.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.540]   It just kind of slowly moves forward.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.540]   Because nobody's there.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.540]   It's just the auto posts.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.540]   I have a count there that's posting all the time.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.540]   I still get responses on mine.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.540]   You check it?
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.540]   I check it because it goes to my Gmail.
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.540]   I see it in my web Gmail.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.540]   Because you have no choice.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:47.540]   I wrote a few posts about us removing the Buzz button on TechCrunch or whatever.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.540]   Did you?
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:53.540]   Yeah, and about all 25 users got really up in arms and came to the comment section.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.540]   How dare you remove the Buzz button?
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:56.540]   That's what they do.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:01.540]   I vividly remember leaving Buzz and all of the hate I got from the 12 people who still
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.540]   used it.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.540]   Like somehow--
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.540]   I don't really leave anything.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.540]   That was my mistake.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:06.540]   I should have just said.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.540]   I'm still here.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.540]   I'm still here.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.540]   I'm still posting.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.540]   I love Buzz.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.540]   You know, I don't know if I had to--
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.540]   I had to pretend.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.540]   Look at two people started following me.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:15.540]   Look at that.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.540]   Two.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.540]   Two.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:21.540]   I don't know if I agree that they could have just rolled it out instantly.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.540]   Gmail is a pretty good example.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.540]   They have had really, really bad scaling issues.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.540]   I know that you-- I hear you complaining about this a lot.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.540]   I totally feel it too.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.540]   I can't even use Gmail over the web anymore because it's so slow for me.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.540]   Really?
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.540]   Yeah, it's just so slow.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.540]   Sometimes not all the time.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.540]   Almost all the time.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.540]   It's kind of a little bit better.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.540]   But there was a while where it was like a huge--
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.540]   Every in the mornings.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.540]   And especially for Google who's obsessed with speed.
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:48.540]   They're so obsessed with speed.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.540]   It's really uncharacteristic.
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.540]   I think that just popped up for me.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.540]   Nobody's really ever--
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.540]   It's better in the morning.
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.540]   More bad.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:57.540]   More bad.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.540]   The batter is--
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.540]   Slickin' more bad a guy.
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:06.540]   I don't think anybody's really ever gained anything by not letting their customers use their product for an extended period of time.
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:09.540]   You got to let people get out of it sometime.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.540]   I think they also--
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.540]   There are lots of physics that must be about it.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.540]   I met with them a little bit before it launched.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:19.540]   And the reason why they wanted to do the staggered roll out is also because they really did want to iterate on the fly.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.540]   They knew this time that they wouldn't nail everything out of the box.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:27.540]   Even though they had been dog food-- internally dog food testing it, they had done that with Wave.
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:28.540]   And Wave was great internally.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.540]   But then when it was released, there were so many things that were wrong with it.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:38.540]   So they knew that as long as they could do this, the staggered roll out still on a massive scale, they would get a lot of good feedback on it.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.540]   And I think that they have.
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:45.540]   Well, there's certain things that obviously need to be worked out, like collapsible comments would be really nice.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.540]   It seems like the number one request.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.540]   Yeah, I want options on what notifications that I see.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:54.540]   If someone I don't know shares opposed to me, I want to be able to toggle that notification on or off.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:59.540]   I use Google Apps, which is made using Google+ with Google Apps.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:03.540]   Unusable, now I have to use two browsers, or I have to go incognito within Chrome.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:10.540]   It's like there are things that they probably knew would be an issue, but now they see how many people it's affecting.
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:14.540]   OK, do 100 people have this problem, or do a million people have this problem?
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.540]   So that's all part of the learning experience.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:22.540]   Right now as people commenting on way earlier things, like posts or albums or something,
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:26.540]   they're going to put them repeating the animated shifts that keeps coming back again.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:27.540]   This is stuff like that.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.540]   That freakin' squid that comes alive with a soy sauce.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.540]   If I have to see that one, I have to jump, every time.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.540]   I think I give him nightmares for a week.
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.540]   This is hilarious.
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:37.540]   I'm like, oh, it's so awful.
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.540]   I didn't watch it because I knew it would be awful.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.540]   You haven't seen it?
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:41.540]   Well, I've seen it in my feeds.
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.540]   I just don't.
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.540]   Not really a lot.
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.540]   You got this?
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.540]   Is it coming up on the...
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.540]   I'm going to pull it on.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.540]   If I search for squid...
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.540]   Right, warning, it is kind of horrifying to see, but the squid is dead.
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.540]   Wait a minute, there's no plus on Google+.
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.540]   There's no search on Google+.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.540]   How would I even find it?
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.540]   How does it do that when it's dead?
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.540]   Well, because it has muscle contractions based on the...
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.540]   It's just dumb.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:02.540]   It's a neurological stuff.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:04.540]   Anyway.
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:08.540]   No, I mean, Facebook doesn't find it because there's no search on this thing.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.540]   Yes, search is another feature like...
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.540]   It's only Google.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.540]   Facebook does the same thing, though.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.540]   They don't roll out features to their entire user base instantly.
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:22.540]   Even the biggest launches where they get everybody in the room and they talk about how awesome it is.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:26.540]   That comes out over the course of weeks and sometimes months before it hits the entire user base.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.540]   I don't know.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.540]   It's not that unusual.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:34.540]   When you're talking about the scale of tens, hundreds of millions of people, you can't open...
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.540]   You can't fling the doors wide open.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.540]   I don't know if anybody's ever actually done that successfully.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.540]   Buzz might have been a successful launch.
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.540]   Did they do that?
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.540]   I don't remember it being a rollout for Buzz.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:49.540]   I think that they rolled it out much faster anyway, but yeah.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.540]   What do you guys actually think of Google+?
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.540]   Do you like it?
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:53.540]   I really like it.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.540]   I mean, I've been having fun using it.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.540]   I've almost been...
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.540]   I love it.
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.540]   I've been off Facebook almost.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.540]   I haven't been using Twitter at all.
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.540]   I think it's fun.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.540]   I think the interactions there are really good.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.540]   I like the sharing features a lot.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.540]   Still driving traffic to your pages, everybody.
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:09.540]   You know, I actually haven't checked much.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.540]   I don't blog my own content that much on Google+ so I haven't really seen it.
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.540]   I don't either.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:20.540]   I use it really more for just sharing stuff I like on the internet rather than personal brand sharing kind of stuff.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.540]   That's one of the successes of it.
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:23.540]   It's just its own thing.
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:26.540]   It's not a reshare of your Twitter feed or your blog posts.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.540]   It's just your Google+ shares.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:35.540]   And when there really is a conversation to be had around something, that's where I've really seen the benefit of people having really great discussions.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.540]   And you know, better than I've seen on Twitter, better than I've seen.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.540]   And there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:40.540]   Oh, there he goes.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:41.540]   Oh, it's creepy.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:45.540]   So it's not alive, but they pour soy sauce on it.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:48.540]   Why?
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.540]   Okay, that's just pain.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.540]   That is so weird.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.540]   You never saw that before?
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.540]   Why is that being shared that much?
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.540]   The funny thing is Trey Rekla has reshared that.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.540]   He's from Busy and Paris.
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.540]   It's on the top of my stream.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.540]   You just can't get away from this thing.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:06.540]   This thing lives on Google+.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:15.540]   Well, again, that's the issues that things are getting reshared by your poor old friends with the first-sharer and then your friends with the next person who shares it.
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:20.540]   And the first shares, they just need to talk to the friend feed guys who learn these lessons over the quarter.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.540]   The friend feed guys who are all now at Facebook.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.540]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.540]   Those guys.
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:25.540]   Hey, friend feed guys, how do we make Google+ better?
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:26.540]   Hey, how do we kill you?
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:27.540]   Hey, Google+ guys.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.540]   Why don't you stop calling me?
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.540]   I'd like to actually bet that the exchange actually happened.
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:36.540]   Paul Bouhite said, "Man, Brett Taylor, no, I'm not going to tell you. What are you crazy about that?"
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:44.540]   Yeah, I think the circles and the ability to filter, I wish I could filter the opposite way, where I tried a little experiment where I tried to make a group of a circle of store and laser pieces.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:51.540]   And then I realized that was a bad idea because now there's a lot of people I don't know showing up in my primary timeline.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:54.540]   Yeah, I only added like 150 people, but that was a mistake.
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.540]   It's not the way it should be used, and I learned that lesson pretty quickly.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:03.540]   But I'm glad that people can filter me out if they don't want to see me in certain circles, you know, if they just want...
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:05.540]   But that's the thing, like I don't just post tech stuff.
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.540]   I post funny stuff where I post Game of Thrones stuff.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.540]   And it's hard to pick circles.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:14.540]   And I feel bad because I don't want to be in a different area than people expect me to be in.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:18.540]   I still think the circles thing is going to break down really quickly.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.540]   I think it's just people are just going to use it for friends.
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:25.540]   There's standard ones. There's friends, co-workers and family.
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.540]   And that's like it. And maybe people will use one of those.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:33.540]   Because they make you drag everyone at least into one circle to be able to see it.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.540]   I don't think that that's going to scale. I think it's a good idea at first.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.540]   And they have a really nice mechanism for doing it.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.540]   But then when you have to manage it, it's a huge pain.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.540]   I mean, no one's going to go back in and say like, "Oh, actually they're going to..."
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:46.540]   But it's a lot easier than it was on Facebook.
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:48.540]   It is, it is. But it was broken on Facebook.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.540]   And they're able to first to admit that too.
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:53.540]   Here's something that collapses the Google+ question.
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.540]   Yeah, I use one of those.
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:57.540]   There's a lot of extensions on Chrome for Google+.
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.540]   There's some that I...
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:55:59.540]   Including one that we'll see...
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:00.540]   That's not really helpful.
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.540]   A GIF that you've seen before in Block Future...
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:06.540]   I don't know, I must be doing some sort of image recognition.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.540]   And we'll block it again from your streaming future.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.540]   Oh.
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.540]   Isn't that clever?
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.540]   You're watching out for the file name.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:17.540]   Clever, but again, this is all stuff that eventually Google+ should have natively.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.540]   That's awesome.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.540]   I think we should just make it a rule. Everybody watching.
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:21.540]   Stop resharing.
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.540]   We already saw it.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.540]   Hey.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.540]   Stop resharing.
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:26.540]   I just reshared your...
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:27.540]   Stop it.
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.540]   Quit...
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.540]   Stop it.
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:30.540]   No, stop it.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.540]   Don't do it anymore.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.540]   That's not what the end is for.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.540]   We all done.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:35.540]   Make your own stuff.
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.540]   Type what I said, but in your own words.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.540]   It would be nice if they could filter out stuff you've seen already in a share.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:41.540]   Just stop resharing.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:42.540]   That's not a Google+ problem.
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:46.540]   I have that problem on Tumblr where I'm following five people with similar interests.
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:47.540]   Big problem on Tumblr.
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:48.540]   It's always bothered me.
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.540]   And I don't know what the solution is.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.540]   Tumblr's...
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:52.540]   They haven't figured it out either.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:58.540]   That's just a problem with something that a lot of people find interesting and then friendships overlap.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.540]   You start seeing this stuff.
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.540]   That's how we learn.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.100]   It's just not as intrusive on Twitter.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.860]   It happens on Twitter, but you don't see the image.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.660]   So it's easier to skim over.
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.460]   It's just what social is all about.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.460]   Is everybody...
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.460]   That's how you know.
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:15.300]   A thousand people say that Michael Jackson's dead.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.100]   Well, that's how you see it.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.100]   That's how you know.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:22.380]   MG, you wrote an article about Google's new page speed service.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:23.700]   This is just wild.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:24.700]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:30.020]   I haven't tried it yet, but yeah, they're apparently...
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.820]   They want people to switch over to using...
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.820]   How do you do this?
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.140]   So you have to switch over to using Google's DNS servers.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.140]   Okay.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:42.460]   And then when you do that, you basically grant them access to be able to look at the way
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:49.460]   that your site is written and they can reconfigure things to make it as fast as possible in their
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:50.460]   view of how to get it started.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.460]   So instead of using...
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:52.460]   So I'm registered on hover.com.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:58.580]   Instead of using hovered's DNS servers, I would go to ghs.google.com and the CNAME entry.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:59.580]   And that's it?
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.580]   Yeah.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.820]   And you sign up for the page speed service.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.020]   I want to do that.
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.020]   So what is green?
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.340]   I just think concept, but it doesn't...
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:08.980]   Like the stuff that does really basic.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.460]   So you know, it compresses your job.
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:12.460]   Right, it compresses.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.460]   It's right.
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.460]   It minifies your CSS and stuff like that, which is great.
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:15.460]   So it's cache.
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.460]   It does cache.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.860]   It does caching, does some edge caching.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.900]   But if there's anything dynamic on your page, it's not really going to work.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.420]   We actually tried it just...
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.420]   Well, of course not.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.940]   If it read, "Ruzz a page" every time.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:28.820]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:30.900]   So we were just kind of fooling around.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:35.980]   So we did the tool that estimates how much faster your site's going to be.
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.140]   And we tried it on gadget.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.820]   And it was like 5 to 10% slower, I think.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.140]   Like it actually said like red negative.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:43.940]   Like you lose speed by doing this.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:44.940]   So they actually...
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:45.940]   Well, at least they told you that.
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:46.940]   Yeah, no, I know.
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:47.940]   Yeah, they tried to be...
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.940]   This is going to be a paid service.
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:49.940]   So when you said money, it's not...
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:50.940]   Right, it's free for now.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:51.940]   They're trying it out for free.
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.580]   But eventually it'll be a paid thing that they offer.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:59:01.380]   So now they have a web page test where I could run twit.tv through it natively and then through
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:02.380]   it.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:03.380]   We'll see.
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:04.380]   We'll let this run.
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.380]   There are other people who do this like currently on live.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:06.940]   Like players won.
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.380]   And they, you know, I think they did a thing at Disrupt.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:14.180]   But they focus more on security and the aspect of it.
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:16.940]   And as a side effect, you get a better page load time.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:17.940]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.780]   So the test started 30 seconds ago.
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.340]   Yeah, this takes a while.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.260]   It's a long test.
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:24.260]   All right.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.740]   Well, we'll come back and give you the results.
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:27.740]   You know what I want?
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:33.340]   I want Google to do a service that's like this except for restaurants and then me taking
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:34.340]   all the flash off the page.
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.940]   I knew it would be a flash free restaurant who has a hosting service.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:38.940]   I love that.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:39.940]   That would be awesome.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.020]   I would pay them for that.
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:44.820]   What is the name of the new Harry Potter...
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:45.820]   Pottermore.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:46.820]   Pottermore.
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:47.820]   Which I know where I'm getting these off.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:51.780]   This is JK Rowling's doing a site.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:54.980]   Now JK Rowling's original site was all flash.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.980]   It was the worst thing I ever saw in my life.
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:57.980]   Pretty bleak.
[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:00.740]   I love that you know that.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.900]   I'm just a few years old.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.900]   Part of my job.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:03.900]   All right.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.900]   Part of my job.
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.380]   Now, unfortunately, this is closed to signups.
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.900]   But I would bet just looking at it, don't you think it's going to be all flash?
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.300]   It's going to be a huge amount of flash.
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.820]   And then we get the video of JK Rowling.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.820]   Which for a while didn't register.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.860]   The first Harry Potter book was published.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.340]   I'm still astonished and delighted by the response to stories in it.
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.500]   Only now on the richest woman in England.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.980]   I have so much money I can laugh at you all.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.980]   But I'm going to make more.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.500]   So this is going to be new Harry Potter stuff?
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.500]   Wasn't it enough?
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.500]   Wasn't seven books enough?
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.500]   It's kind of like the...
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.100]   I'm going to get in trouble with this.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.380]   It's kind of like the sima-rillion for Harry Potter in a way.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.380]   Right.
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.380]   I think it's a lot of like backstory stuff.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.380]   Right.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.380]   That makes sense.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:48.020]   I'm going to get into the story lines, into the people and the houses.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.180]   Correct me if I'm wrong, chat room.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.180]   But I'm pretty sure that's what it's supposed to be.
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.180]   I think that makes sense.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.180]   Oh, they will.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.180]   I know.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.180]   Oh, I know.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.780]   Yeah, that's what I understand of it also.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.700]   I mean for die-hard Harry Potter fans, we all know them.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:06.820]   We talk a lot about Google and others trying to buy those patents, which Google didn't
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.860]   get, but Apple and its consortium did.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.020]   There are other patents.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:13.300]   Now IBM sold some patents to Google.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.300]   IBM owns all the patents.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.300]   IBM?
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.300]   Yeah, IBM.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:21.940]   One of the reasons IBM is still around is a player is because they have so many patents.
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:27.260]   Google acquired 1,000 patents.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.220]   And I don't know if this is, that Google wants to become a patent role.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.220]   It's more just...
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.220]   It's like defensive.
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.340]   I think they feel really threatened after the North Pole patent thing.
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.420]   They felt threatened before it.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.420]   They still have less than a thousand patents total.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.420]   Well now they finally have over...
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.420]   Really?
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.420]   Yeah, they had like...
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:44.940]   So they more than doubled their patents?
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:51.860]   And that's why I was so vital that they really needed to win those 6,000 plus North Pole patents.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:56.740]   And I think Apple and Microsoft realized that and just swooped in there and...
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.740]   Outfit them.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.140]   Very interesting.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:03.380]   But yeah, I mean Google stance now is that there are plenty of patents out there they
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:07.060]   say and they'll go after every one of them.
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:13.380]   They're trying to get to the point where they reach mutual assured destruction where they
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.380]   just...
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.380]   Right.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.380]   They stop getting sued by everyone.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.620]   It almost doesn't even matter what the patents are for.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.620]   Right.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:22.020]   Because yeah, they don't need to cancel each other out necessarily.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:25.260]   They just need to be able to sue other people if other people are going to sue them.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.260]   Right.
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.260]   You're going to sue them.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.260]   Yeah, you're going to sue them.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.260]   I'm going to sue you.
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:30.260]   Right.
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.260]   It's like the companies are buying weapons.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.260]   Right.
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.860]   For these battles with shields and guns, it's really odd.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.460]   It's really funny because okay, so this American life just did a show about the whole thing.
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.460]   Right.
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.060]   Last week I think or the week before.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:42.780]   And it's amazing program.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.060]   If you know a lot about this space, nothing surprising in there.
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:51.780]   But many of the terms that they use to describe patents are terms that are mutually assured
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.780]   destruction.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.780]   Clear war.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.300]   Yeah, nuclear war, weapons of mass destruction.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.300]   I mean it's...
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.860]   It is very much cold war like.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.500]   Yeah, I think it is the way you combat your opponents without actually attacking them.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.420]   And we all conclude that software patents are a terrible idea.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.900]   Let's just get rid of them or is there any justification?
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.900]   Is there any...
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:13.060]   You know, it's funny I got in a little battle with Neillie Patel who kind of believes in
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.060]   software patents.
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.220]   I was a little surprised.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.140]   I don't think there's any justification for it.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.140]   Let's get rid of them.
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   Look at the wasted amount of money, time, innovation that's lost because of software
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.140]   patents.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:27.460]   Well, I think the problem with software patents is that things are patented under the guise
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.020]   of software patents that are just conceptual.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.020]   And that's...
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.020]   I think we're...
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.020]   We're not really a big problem.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:35.900]   There's the conceptual patents that are just very broad and they don't really make any
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.180]   sense as patents because patents are supposed to be non-obvious.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.180]   And then there are these...
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.420]   You know, this other class of patents which is just duplicating stuff that's already been
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.420]   patented.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.580]   So you have duplication and then you also have concept.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:51.940]   Patents are supposed to be about specific ideas and processes.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:53.380]   So if you're talking about like...
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:58.900]   You know, there are infinite ways to add and subtract and divide numbers to get to a
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.900]   million.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.940]   And then there's one specific way to do that.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.700]   That's very different from the concept of adding numbers until you get to a million.
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.620]   So do we just need to reform the system?
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.620]   I think...
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.300]   Well, no matter what happens, we have to do it.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.300]   So...
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.300]   Right.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:13.300]   And they tried to do that and they only did...
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.340]   They limited its success.
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:18.500]   I think they reformed a bit of the patent office, how it works or whatever.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.620]   And there were some pluses in that but overall the system is still the same.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.220]   And I mean, this keeps coming up and up and over and over again.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.980]   It's like Google...
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.540]   This is the big story now because Google...
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.500]   Their mentality has always been like, "Oh, we don't really need to worry about the patent
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   issue."
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.500]   And so there the guy...
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.300]   That's why everyone is coming after it.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.500]   And that's why this is a story now.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.260]   It's not just Android patents.
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.180]   It's the other thing, the MPEG-L-A stuff.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.180]   The EPA, yeah.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.180]   What's talking about that?
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.180]   Well, go ahead.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.180]   But it's...
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.140]   You know, like Microsoft back in the day, even though they're now a big patent player,
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.620]   they used to have a similar mentality where they didn't think that they needed to get
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.100]   all these patents until everyone started coming after them.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.860]   And now they're one of the big players.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.100]   And this is going to force Google to be one of the big players in it.
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.500]   And I think the problem might go away for a little bit once Google gets up to their level
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.540]   where they can dissuade these other attacks from coming up.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.900]   But then it will keep coming up again when some other players up there.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.900]   Well, don't you guys get...
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:09.900]   It's totally unsustainable.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:13.580]   You get the sense that the people who are granting the software patents don't really understand
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.580]   what the patent is.
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:15.580]   Right.
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.580]   They get...
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.980]   I think they get like 12 hours or something to look at one.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.420]   And if they make a mistake, then it's weeks and...
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.900]   And there's no domain expertise required.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:27.460]   It's not like the people who are reviewing software patents have to be former software
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.460]   engineers.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.460]   And that's...
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:33.740]   I think you could probably solve like 80% of the problems just by ensuring domain expertise
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.220]   of patent review.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.220]   It's just top to bottom.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:41.740]   Me and I also suggested making it very expensive to pursue a patent, which eliminates it from
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:42.740]   the real patent.
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.140]   I think in many ways that's actually worse because that right now it's broken to the
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.140]   point where only the big players...
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.620]   What's a real guy do at that point?
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:49.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:52.820]   If you're a small startup and you have no defense against this, then it just gets even
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:57.260]   worse when your one potential defense is now swept out from underneath you.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.260]   Right.
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:02.260]   So, MPEG-LA is the company that owns the H.264 patent.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.860]   It's a consortium of a bunch of different companies.
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:08.300]   They said, "Oh, we'll never charge royalties for small companies."
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.540]   You know, there's a real risk.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.220]   I mean, we distribute stuff in H.264.
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.420]   There's the real, very real risk that they could come along and say to podcasters, for
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.460]   instance, "Hey, are you gonna pay up because you're using H.264?"
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.180]   They said, "Oh, we'll never do that."
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:29.620]   So Google suggested they purchased WebM, which is a codec, and underlying that is VPA.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.580]   And they said, "Look, we're gonna open sources.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.060]   We're gonna buy this.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.500]   We're gonna open source it.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.580]   We're gonna say, we're gonna, you know, onto the company that developed VPA.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:44.700]   We own them and we're gonna give you perpetual royalty-free licenses to the patents on VPA."
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.380]   So everybody just used it.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.540]   It was their proposal to use it in HTML5.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:55.820]   Well, now, I'm Pig LA has fired back and they say, "Well, turns out 12 companies have patents
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:07:03.860]   essential to the VPA algorithm and that in fact Google isn't gonna be able to either
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:08.100]   indemnify or give you royalty-free licenses."
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.700]   Well, the good news here is nobody actually uses WebM.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.100]   Why is that Google?
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.100]   Everybody uses H.264.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.100]   I mean, this is a little scary.
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.300]   Well, yeah, I mean, both Google and Mozilla, so Mozilla's obviously the huge open source
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.300]   player.
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:23.820]   Google less so that they're trying to say that they're always open about everything.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.340]   But they could both agree, for instance, to use WebM.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:29.940]   Yes, and Mozilla's always, because one of the reasons that Google says that they got
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.380]   that they're doing this whole WebM thing is because Mozilla would never get on board
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:39.140]   with H.264 fully, because they will not use something that's patent-encumbered at all.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:43.100]   So they did not build into the browser the ability to play back H.264.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.100]   Right.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.940]   And so, HTML5 can't move forward with using that.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.940]   There is no right now in HTML5.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:54.500]   The bracket video bracket doesn't call on anything because of this.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.540]   There's no support for anything.
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:03.020]   And so Google has said that they're gonna support this basically because Mozilla's supporting
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:06.420]   this and they agree with that stance that this is the right thing to do, that they think
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:09.780]   that they can prove that this is the open source way to do it.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:13.700]   The problem has been, and people have been saying this, they're no one sure that these
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.300]   are fully patent protected.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.460]   And what happens, why would everyone switch over to using that?
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:21.980]   Of course, at the same time on the opposite ends, Apple and Microsoft and many others are
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.380]   the players who are part of the MPaLA consortium.
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.940]   So they all have conflicting interests here about this.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:31.380]   But it's another mucked up situation.
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.620]   We're to take a break when we come back.
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:37.860]   The biggest story, the story that everybody on Google+ wanted us talk about, AT&T has
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:43.020]   said, "Oh, you know, that unlimited plan that you guys have, grandfather in, and not so
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.020]   fast."
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:46.220]   We'll talk about throttling.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.100]   There's a few people who'd like to throttle AT&T right now.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.460]   Before I do though, let me talk about FreshBooks.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.660]   FreshBooks.com, if you'd like to follow along with me at home.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:59.180]   It's funny, I found out about FreshBooks myself and started using them seven years
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:02.220]   ago because I was still a freelancer.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:07.740]   I was working up in Canada doing the TV shows up there and would Bill Rogers every month.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:09.780]   I just hated making invoices.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:12.380]   You launch Excel or Word or something.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:15.220]   You know, you have printed ads, you have mail it to them, and you hope you remember to
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.220]   do it at the end of the month.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.820]   And if you don't, you hope you remember to do it with the end of the next.
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.300]   It's a pain in the butt.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.660]   So she said, "Look, hey, there's this really cool site."
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.660]   Amber.
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.660]   Amber did.
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.660]   Not you.
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.660]   No.
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:27.660]   Amber MacArthur did.
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:28.660]   And she said, "Look, this is really cool site.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:29.660]   It's very web 2.0.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.660]   It's called FreshBooks.
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:32.060]   It's some Toronto folks created it.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.060]   And I started using this.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.060]   And it was just a lifesaver.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:35.540]   I put my logo on the page.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.620]   It sends out email and voices.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:38.620]   It'll also print.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:39.620]   I used to print for Rogers.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.380]   It would print and send an email and voice.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.380]   But now 2 million people have used FreshBooks.
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.940]   It is so cool.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.460]   They've added some really nice features.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:54.820]   For instance, now with FreshBooks, they have a "Pay Me Now" button right in the invoice.
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:58.860]   So I think a lot of times your clients want to pay you right away.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:09:59.860]   Just a pain.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:01.380]   Just as much as invoices are paying.
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:02.660]   Paying the bills is a pain.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:06.460]   So now they just click the button and they can use a credit card or PayPal or authorized
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.300]   net or there's 11 other payment gateways.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:14.180]   Just to pay you right away, you can even set up automatic payments, which is so cool.
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.620]   Automatic invoicing, automatic payments.
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.620]   So you both are kind of out of the loop.
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.380]   It just happens for you.
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:21.980]   This was nice for me because I worked in Canada.
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.900]   It does all the currencies.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:28.620]   It does the currency translations automatically.
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.980]   For an additional fee, they will print it out, stamp it and mail it for you, which I
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.580]   think is really great.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:36.460]   If you do time and hours, they have an iPhone app.
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:39.980]   There's also a web app that will keep track of your time and hours and then put it right
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.540]   in the bill.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.780]   So many nice features on this.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:48.140]   If you're still doing invoices the old way by hand, check it out.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.140]   Here's the deal.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:53.900]   Go to freshbooks.com right now and you can start for free.

[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:03.340]   It's very affordable, but free for the first three forever.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.380]   I mean, that's a really nice deal.
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.900]   It will only take you about a minute to set up an account.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:11.300]   And once you've got it, you are going to love it.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:17.060]   And by the way, they are giving away a birthday cake to one of our audience members.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:21.060]   Every week, you don't have to be, it doesn't, you have to be your birthday to get the birthday
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.060]   cake.
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:25.100]   Just sign up and let them know you heard about it on Twitch.
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.660]   Freshbooks.com.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:31.300]   Make billing and invoicing absolutely painless.
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.300]   It's just great.
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:37.220]   I'm the first web 2.0 sites I ever used and I still have a real soft spot for them.
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.940]   They're just fantastic.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.780]   Free for the first three, freshbooks.com.
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:50.020]   Thank you for their support of this week in tech.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.980]   Here's the, I think you did this chart.
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:53.300]   Didn't you, M.G., is that your chart?
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.300]   No.
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:55.300]   This is from ours Technica.
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.300]   No.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.300]   I love this.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:03.060]   Did a nice job of putting together all the costs of data from all the different, oh,
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.540]   it's Apple Insider that did this.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.900]   Appleinsider.com did this chart.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:13.660]   But unfortunately, AT&T is going to throttle the heaviest unlimited data users starting
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.660]   October 1.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.180]   Do you have an unlimited plan, Sarah?
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:17.180]   Still?
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.180]   Do you have one of them?
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.180]   Did you grandfather?
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.180]   Yeah, the ones that won it.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.180]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:22.180]   Well, I do for my iPad, yeah, because I started on AT&T.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:27.020]   But what's funny about this story, I kind of have to just chuckle is that I moved over
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:34.260]   from AT&T to Verizon because AT&T was downright unusable in our apartment and many other places.
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:38.940]   So I had to, I decided even though I know that data is overall going to be a little
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:44.020]   bit slower on Verizon, I'm willing to take that hit because I want my tablet or my phone
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.100]   to be stable overall.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:51.660]   And to think that AT&T is going to throttle people who are heavy users, and I'm totally
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:52.860]   in that 5% bracket.
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:58.300]   I mean, if it means five hours of streaming music per month, that's me.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.860]   I just kind of have to laugh because it's like, well, what else do they have?
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:03.740]   If they're not going to be any faster data-wise.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:04.740]   That's a good point.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:05.740]   Why use AT&T?
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.740]   I don't know.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.300]   I mean, some people say, I don't have a problem with AT&T.
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.540]   It works just fine in my town.
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.540]   That's great.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.540]   It doesn't work fine.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.540]   It's not in the Bay Area.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.540]   Nope.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.540]   So that's why I moved.
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:17.460]   So I think, I don't know what the problem is.
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.020]   Well there's a lot of IRA users.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.020]   Let me just put it that way.
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.500]   October 1st, they don't say what kind of throttling.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:28.860]   It says starting October 1st, smartphone customers with unlimited data plans may experience reduced
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:32.580]   speeds once their usage in a billing cycle reaches the level.
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:37.060]   You can't even know this, by the way, that puts you among the top 5% of heaviest data
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.060]   users.
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.060]   You don't even know that.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.460]   It would just happen.
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.300]   It's not like, oh, you've used four gigabytes.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.940]   You've used five gig-- no.
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.340]   You just have to be in this magic top 5%.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.340]   I think that's annoying.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:54.180]   Well, I mean, look, I don't really personally get much joy out of defending AT&T.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.420]   Oh, I think you're enjoying it right now.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.420]   Man, they are--
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.420]   Just to be contrary.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.940]   I'm going to toss my phone out the window at any given moment.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.700]   But I mean, honestly, how many people is this really effect?
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.700]   Well they say--
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.700]   Very few.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.260]   And extraordinarily small-- well, it's 5%.
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.260]   Yeah, they say--
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.260]   1 in 20.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.260]   Exactly.
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.260]   5% 1 in 20.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.260]   And what are you doing to kind of get to that point?
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.260]   I mean, it's so kind of--
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.460]   They're watching Twitch.
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:17.460]   What live?
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.460]   Every day.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.460]   That's messed up.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:20.460]   Not on Wi-Fi.
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:21.460]   Highly recommended.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.020]   Yeah, that's a good thing to do.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.940]   Well, I think your experience would be better at live.
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:28.260]   You're going to get higher quality video.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.260]   Maybe you're mobile.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:30.260]   Maybe you don't have Wi-Fi nearby.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.260]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:32.260]   You know, actually, I suspect these top 5%.
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.500]   A lot of them don't.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.100]   They use 3G for their--
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.100]   Their main computer.
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.100]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:40.260]   I think that's probably more than a few people who do that.
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.260]   Moving around exactly.
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:42.260]   Or truck drivers.
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:43.260]   I know they do that.
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:47.860]   My bandwidth on my iPad in three days last month.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:48.860]   Three days.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.860]   How many gigs did you buy?
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.860]   I had the lowest one, right?
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.860]   Like 150 megs or something.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.860]   Of course you went through it.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:53.860]   300.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:55.860]   That's when I laugh at the Chromebook.
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:56.860]   You get 100 megs a month.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:57.860]   That's like, what is that?
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:58.860]   I wish I had that one.
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:14:59.860]   I went to it on my iPad.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:00.860]   That would be nice.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:01.860]   That's attempting to load my Gmail once.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:02.860]   100 megs.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:03.860]   100 megs.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:04.860]   I don't even know.
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:08.260]   I can't even think of what is 100 megs.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.260]   Nothing.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.460]   Oh, here's my speed comparison that came in.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.460]   Optimized, you get it in a second less.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:18.180]   It's 18.5% improvement in page load time.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:21.860]   If you go there the second time, so they are doing so the caching.
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.660]   23% improvement.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:25.660]   So that's worth it.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.820]   Now it's free right now if you can get into the program.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:29.820]   I would do that.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.260]   We are already, by the way, this is PHP.
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.620]   We're doing all that PHP caching and stuff.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:36.100]   We would do a lot of caching.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.620]   This is a dynamic page, but it is heavily cached.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.620]   That's a pretty big improvement.
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.100]   I would do that.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.100]   And look, they made a movie for me.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.100]   Let's see.
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:49.820]   Yeah, it shows the loads next to each other.
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:50.820]   Look at that.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:52.660]   Holy cow.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:54.500]   It's black and white.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.500]   Oh.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:56.500]   They also turn here.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.500]   Turn here.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:58.500]   That's what you have to give up.
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.540]   I remember that they used to do that on AOL.
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:06.140]   All the images would be squunched beyond the pair.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:07.740]   Is that a technical term?
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:08.740]   Squunched.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:10.740]   It's exactly a technical term.
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:11.740]   Well, you never know.
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.660]   I haven't actually squunched.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:14.660]   Squunched?
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:15.660]   You never heard that?
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.660]   I'm going to add that to my vocabulary.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.660]   Topiary.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:19.660]   He did it for the Lulls.
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:24.820]   Ryan Massey on Google+ suggested we talk about the Lulls' sec story.
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:31.620]   British police arrested a teenager yesterday, actually on July 27th.
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:37.700]   They said it's Topiary, who of course is the guy who has been chatting with people on
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.700]   Twitter and other places.
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.260]   He's got a good sense of humor.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.340]   He's a funny guy.
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:48.540]   Lulls' sec, they think, might have deliberately tricked the authorities into believing that
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:52.220]   somebody else is the real Topiary.
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.620]   Sounds about right.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:01.780]   According to an article published in the Daily Tech website by Jason Mick, the real Topiary
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:06.380]   is a 23-year-old Swedish hacker, not a teenager from Shetland.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:07.940]   He's got a chat log.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:11.620]   Do you think there's just one Topiary or is it like that as like V?
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:12.620]   Is it like that movie?
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.620]   What's that movie?
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:14.620]   V for Vendetta?
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:15.620]   Yeah, V for Vendetta.
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:16.620]   I think that they would...
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:17.620]   I am Sponticus.
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:22.540]   I guess it's possible that Topiary is just one person physically living in Sweden or
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.340]   wherever, but it makes more sense that it's a group of people because that's how this
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:32.740]   whole anonymous Lulls' sec organization that it's all founded on, the idea that you can't
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:35.820]   just arrest somebody and the whole thing's going to stop because the too many of us and
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:39.180]   we're all working together and you don't know who we are.
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:44.820]   Topiary's Twitter feed has gone silent, but maybe that's part of the game.
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:46.820]   Well, if they want to think of the authorities to think that he's in custody.
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:48.300]   This reminds me a lot of V for Vendetta.
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.300]   I love this.
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.300]   They're playing with everybody.
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:56.780]   I mean, it could be the other way too, where he actually wants to be the only or she or
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:57.780]   whoever.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:01.380]   They want to be the only Topiary, but when you're really underground like this, you can't
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:04.340]   exactly come out and say, "Oh, that guy's not Topiary."
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.140]   Actually, what you want is for everybody thinking Topiary.
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.140]   In some ways.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.740]   I mean, if you feel bad for the invitation button.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:17.020]   So H.R. 1981 passed the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:21.380]   It's the ISP Data Retention Bill.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:25.140]   Of course, they use child pornography as always as the straw man.
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.380]   You don't want this, right?
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.380]   Oh, man.
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.380]   I'll pass this bill then.
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:32.360]   You must be in favor of child pornography if you don't like this idea.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:36.260]   What it does is it requires Internet service providers to keep 12 month logs of customers'
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:41.880]   names, credit card information, and other identifying information so that law enforcement
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.900]   can go to the ISP and say, "Hey, who did that win?"
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:53.140]   Now, admittedly, if you were a child pornography, if they wanted that information to be valuable,
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:19:00.780]   there's lots of other things, including piracy, that this might be useful for.
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:04.700]   If a democracy in technology says, "We don't see that this would help in any way catch
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.680]   criminals involved in child pornography."
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.000]   It's going to be a tiny percentage of the cases law enforcement uses.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.320]   This also sounds like it's going to get hacked in six hours.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:18.120]   It's just so easy to get around.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.360]   I mean, okay, go to a public library, spoof your record address.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.560]   Just don't use your home computer.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.240]   Or use your neighbor's internet connection.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.600]   I mean, it's so incredibly easy to get around this.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.020]   Another real problem, though, is to assume that this was the IP address that this came
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.020]   in on.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.020]   And now it's got to be right.
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:39.260]   This has to be common issue because it wasn't there somebody recently who was picked up
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:40.260]   for child pornography.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.260]   Yes.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.260]   Yes.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.260]   Yes.
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.260]   Yes.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.260]   Yes.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.260]   Yes.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:47.260]   You imagine that, yeah.
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:50.260]   Well, anyway, you might want to keep your eye on HR 1981 and--
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.260]   Sounds like a terrible idea.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.260]   HR 1984.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.260]   Oh.
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.260]   It should be, shouldn't it?
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:55.260]   They got-- they missed it by three.
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:56.260]   They missed it by three.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:57.260]   Well done.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.340]   Um, moving on.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:00.880]   Let's see what else.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.240]   And you've got all the stories there.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.840]   If anybody wants to-- I'm not going to get to all of them.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.720]   The Walkman is back.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.720]   That's exciting.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.720]   So confused.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.720]   Are you excited about that?
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.720]   Yeah, there's--
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.720]   You just skip like five stories.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:11.720]   I'm just--
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.720]   And you settled on the Walkman story.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.720]   You don't think that's a--
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.720]   No, you just skip five stories.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.560]   I'm asking you whatever you want to talk about.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.920]   Listen, I will say that the Walkman, I like it because there's a karaoke button.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:21.920]   So--
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:22.920]   Yes.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.920]   Exactly.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:24.920]   You know me, girl.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920]   Mm-hmm.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.920]   Wait.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.920]   We have karaoke.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.520]   When that'd be fun-- - It would be pretty fun.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.720]   - Yeah. You guys did one. You get a great one
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.280]   at revision three. - We did, yes.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.920]   - I like that. - It was fun.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.720]   - It was pretty,wise before my time.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.200]   - Pre-Voronika, yeah.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.640]   Who is Chameleon Air, and jeez.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:42.620]   (laughing)
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:45.220]   - I have to say, I'm like, why does he keep coming up?
[01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:46.920]   - I have to say this on the car right up here.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:49.200]   - I think he's topiary, actually.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.380]   - I tech conferences. He's been on panels.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.360]   - It's a great name. I didn't know what it means.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.320]   - I asked you why do we keep talking about Chameleon Air?
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.800]   I don't know one of his songs, and Emji says,
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.280]   "Because he goes to every conference."
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.040]   I said, "Why is he going to everything that's had conferences?"
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.960]   - You don't know all the words to ride and dirty?
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.840]   - No, I don't. He's the ride and dirty guy.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.480]   - I thought he was the backup one.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.000]   - This is why Spotify was invented.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.600]   - I only know the weirdo version, white and nerdy.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.440]   - What, nerdy?
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.280]   - I didn't even know that that was a Chameleon Air spoof.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.600]   - Apparently, that's the only one I know.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.560]   - So he's meeting-- - So I know that song.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.640]   I know that song. Is that his famous song?
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.600]   Yeah, I think he won a Grammy for it.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.440]   - Well, there you go.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.280]   - I don't know if it's for that or for that.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.120]   - He's not on Spotify.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.600]   - I don't know if the kids are listening to these days.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.120]   - Oh no, loading, that's loading. Spotify's still loading.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.000]   - So what is he going to also win a crunchy
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.600]   for best hip-hop star in the tech community?
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.640]   - He does. He's still on his way.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.440]   - He says, "I've used Android devices and they suck."
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.640]   - So he came to-- - Was it disrupt?
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.040]   - It was our smaller mobile crunch-up event thing on Friday,
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.160]   down in Palo Alto at day well off this, actually.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:54.160]   And he got up at the very end of the conference.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.640]   - I got up at the-- - I got up.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.040]   - You can pump it up in the house
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.160]   and we're gonna have a dance party right after MG explains
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.640]   who that's going to be. - And so he got up
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.160]   and like I was saying earlier, we had Matias Duarte
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.680]   from Android up there and Camillionaire asked him
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:10.760]   just right to his face, just said basically,
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:14.200]   "I've tried to use so many Android devices out there
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.880]   and they all suck."
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.760]   - So this guy's like you guys.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.960]   - Yeah. - What's going on there?
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:22.360]   - Birth name, do we know?
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.120]   - It's on his crunch base, bro.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.120]   - Yeah. - He has a crunch base, bro.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.120]   - It's just funny when we-- - Yeah.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:31.440]   - And then Camillionaire asked, "This is riding dirty."
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.120]   - All right, everybody, let's go.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.640]   Is this gonna get filthy in a minute?
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.880]   - I don't know, I've never heard this.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.720]   - This is from everybody wants a thug.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, Camillionaire.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:45.120]   - I don't know this song.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:45.960]   - No!
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:50.400]   - I mean, I don't think guys should explain
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.880]   the context behind this song, maybe what it's about,
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.160]   but you might be able to use your imagination.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.960]   - I thought it was just, you know, when you need to do
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.880]   a lot of exhaust pipe or something,
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.880]   you ride in dirty. - Right, yeah.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.360]   - Maybe you didn't use mobile oil with--
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.160]   - Right, yeah. - You didn't get your
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.160]   smog check, no smog check this morning.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.840]   - No, it's unletting option.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.640]   - Try it in your previous.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.360]   - He's right. - Cam made bad dancer,
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.200]   I'm glad that's over.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.680]   - So this is my favorite paragraph from MG Sigler's
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.480]   Camillionaire pleads with Android Design
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.400]   to lead to give him a decent device.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.680]   My favorite, but Camillionaire kept pressing.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.680]   (laughing)
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.400]   He wanted a single-- - He's on with a hard answer.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.800]   - Clear answer.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.000]   Which Android device should he use?
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.960]   This is the Duarte guy, this is a Sicilian.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.560]   - Yeah, he basically told him, you know,
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.240]   stay tuned, we're gonna have some better devices
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.800]   coming out for you. - This is, I'm hoping
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.280]   the police have been there, stock answers,
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.360]   which is always been the answer.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.200]   - We've got an Android phone that you are gonna love.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.600]   - Said Duarte. - Yeah.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.040]   - That's good. - Did he sound like that?
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.360]   - It was a great, it was a fun moment though.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.680]   In a brief moment of levity.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.840]   (laughing)
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.160]   - And he doesn't want it. - Why is Camillionaire
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.600]   at your event? - He's the--
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.440]   - He actually, he-- - Is he a real
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.280]   like technology and so he goes, or how did he--
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.880]   - Who doesn't like technology right now?
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.520]   - Yeah. - But he has an aperture,
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.160]   or some-- - He was doing something
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.800]   for a while, he has some, you know,
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.200]   start investments or something that he was doing.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.960]   But he, I mean, he gets up there
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.720]   and he's been on stage before it disrupted.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.000]   He was very knowledgeable about what,
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.480]   and he asks the best questions usually because it's like,
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.680]   instead of all of us thinking, you know, amongst each other
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.480]   and we're all like speaking in circles, you know,
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.080]   he thinks more like outside the box, like a regular--
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.360]   - Why is there no good? - Right, yeah.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.720]   - I think that's a great question actually.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.760]   - It's kind of funny how anytime someone's more well known
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.600]   for a song called "Writing Dirty"
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.200]   or for being a very successful actor or something like that,
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.680]   when they get really interested in technology,
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.480]   all the rest of us go, what are they doing here?
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.320]   (laughing)
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]   - I think it's less than that, I think we're just
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.560]   more like kind of confused.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:43.400]   - Yeah. - But oh, I didn't--
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.800]   - Do you think for real?
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.240]   - I really care. - Sure.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.080]   - It happens.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:47.920]   - By the way, when I search for--
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.120]   - I wish more people were like--
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.560]   - Me too. - Interesting technology.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.040]   - Yeah, I'm trying search for "Writing Dirty"
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.320]   - When I search for "Writing Dirty"--
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.160]   - Don't look at the images.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.080]   - Weird owls came up. - Okay.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.800]   - Oh, the images? - Yeah, don't do that.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.800]   - Should I go to Urban Dictionary and look at that?
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.200]   - Yeah, you can, yeah, that might just not up on the screen.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.960]   - That's where I would always go when you kids--
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   - Purple are the whole thing.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.120]   - Nice.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.200]   (laughing)
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.120]   - It doesn't have quite the--
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.520]   - This is you have to.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.200]   - We need to do a stick with the wings.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.200]   We're going real fast.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:26.680]   - We should get the audience shot
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.840]   where no one is moving.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.480]   - Do sit and still.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.760]   - They're like, what is dead out there?
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.280]   - I was told this would be the price is right.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.880]   Where is Bob Barker?
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.680]   (laughing)
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.200]   Logitech, oh, this is so exciting.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.640]   I know you've all been waiting to buy Google TV.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.040]   Logitech has dropped the price to $99.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.520]   - We're flooding the market.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.120]   - We have one.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:48.960]   It's been--
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:49.800]   - $299.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.960]   - It has not been unlocked.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.160]   - It has not been removed from the box.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.360]   - Oh, we've had it.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.200]   - You might just want to win it.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.040]   - Many of it there any months.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.800]   - I bought it for $299.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:58.640]   - And?
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.000]   - It disconnected it.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.200]   I did take it out of the box, connected it.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.360]   But if they, okay, so somebody asked me,
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.600]   should we get this?
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.160]   If they put Android market on that device
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.760]   and you can now suddenly play Angry Birds.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:13.600]   - Right.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:14.440]   - Which you can't on the rope.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.920]   - You can say that's any product.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.840]   If this product did this, this, this, this,
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.680]   the USB software.
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.040]   - If it was just, if it was better,
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.120]   it would be easy.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.320]   - Yeah, if they made the product better,
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:24.880]   I might use it.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.160]   - I'm not sure though.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.720]   - Well, maybe you should buy it for $99.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.520]   And then they'd make the product better.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.560]   No, that doesn't work that way.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.680]   The better thing about that story,
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.360]   and I think that they refuted this now,
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.320]   or I think Engedge had actually posted the--
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.160]   - The correction?
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.000]   - Yeah, the correction of it.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.200]   But it was originally when it came out saying that
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.880]   there were more returns than there were sales of the review.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.440]   - Exactly, it's like, how does it--
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.000]   - They're saying, now they're saying like that
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.960]   that the, all the reviewers returned it,
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.240]   in addition to all the people who bought it.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.280]   - That could be a part of it.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.480]   But no, I think they're saying that the,
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.560]   the actual retailers that they shipped it to,
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.760]   so these weren't users returning another one.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.600]   - Returns from the channel.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.040]   - Yeah, from the channel in Victoria.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:04.880]   - So in other words, they--
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.040]   - Which isn't any better, I mean, that's like--
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:06.880]   - Oh, it's worse. - Yeah.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.720]   - It's really terrible.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.320]   - Maybe we should unbox it.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.160]   - Yeah, it's gonna be a collector's item.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.720]   - Might need to return it and get some money.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.960]   - Well, you can't sell it for $2.99 on eBay anymore.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.800]   I can tell you that right now, that's it on that.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.640]   Let's see here, Nintendo having kind of the same problem
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.480]   with surprisingly the 3DS.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.120]   - It's priced-- - With pricing?
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:25.520]   - To 80. - Oh, didn't you think
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.760]   that was awesome?
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:27.600]   - No.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.960]   (laughing)
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.480]   You know, if they'd put Android marketplace on it,
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.320]   it could be amazing.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.680]   - It's true, absolutely.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.840]   - But that's like, they just have that,
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:35.920]   they have their new Android phones,
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.200]   it's the 3D one, right?
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.040]   And that's like--
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:38.880]   - There are a bunch of 3D phones.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:39.720]   - It's such a deal.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.160]   - It's a novelty thing that's like,
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.760]   interesting for five minutes and then I do--
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.400]   - We had somebody in the studio though,
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.920]   one of our fans came in with it
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.240]   and he was taking pictures and he said,
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:51.040]   "Now go like this so that it will look cool."
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.960]   And Chad, you saw it, right?
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.000]   It looked cool, see, he's nodding.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:55.840]   Of course he's like 20.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.920]   - And he and his one friend who have the 3DS can see it.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:00.760]   And then everyone else.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.600]   - Everyone else.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.760]   - It's lenticular, so you don't need glasses.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.480]   Same thing with the phones, you don't need glasses.
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.680]   And that's kind of cool.
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.000]   - I get real sick. - It's also really hard to see.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.240]   - You're fucking answering anything.
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:11.080]   - Did you contrast the phone?
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.000]   - But they have a little slider
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.160]   that you can turn it up and down.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.240]   I just think it's so silly.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.920]   - Could you imagine having that as your main phone though?
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.520]   Like a 3D screen trying to look at that?
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.360]   - No, that's okay.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.080]   - We all look at our phones.
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:24.640]   - So the Nintendo 3DS was 250 bucks.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:27.240]   They're gonna drop it to 169, so it didn't go down to $80.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.920]   It went down by $80.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:29.960]   Still not enough.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.680]   - Wasn't Amazon having a real hard time?
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.880]   Didn't they take the 3DS off the store for a while too?
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.520]   I believe Amazon took the biggest down.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.360]   - Yeah, they did, I don't remember why.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.200]   - Are you recusing from this enough?
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.800]   - Sorry, I'm just stating a fact.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.520]   I wasn't making a judgment call.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.960]   As I do a show on the PlayStation Network,
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.160]   I should recuse myself in the discussion of gaming consoles.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.200]   - Oh yeah, Nintendo.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.600]   No, you can dish.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.080]   - We were talking about this last week on TNT
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:55.640]   and how at least most of us on the show said,
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.520]   "Listen, Nintendo has been somewhat vocal
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.400]   about how a lot of mobile gaming apps
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.080]   and the experience just kinda crappy.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:05.320]   And they're more, they're coming from a high quality
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:08.480]   standpoint and they're just not really gonna get into that game
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.040]   and they're almost more annoyed than anything else
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.840]   by how the quality of the gaming experience
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:17.360]   has been diminished by all these developers
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.120]   putting out something that's kinda stupid.
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.320]   Well, you look at numbers like this and you think,
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.160]   okay, well Nintendo has to at least admit
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.760]   that whether they think it's crap or not,
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.320]   it's eating into their market.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.600]   - Yeah, they see the train coming,
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.160]   but they're paralyzed acting.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.160]   And the funny thing is they,
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:33.200]   they more than anybody else, more than Microsoft or Sony,
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:35.840]   they've been vocal about the fact that Apple
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.160]   is kind of their new, they called it the competitor
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.280]   of the future, right?
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.280]   So what I've been saying for years is,
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:44.320]   okay, they've got the biggest and arguably
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.880]   one of the best game publishing houses in the world.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.520]   I mean, they build their entire hardware business
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.480]   around their franchises.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.280]   Just go make software.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.760]   If the gaming experience is so crap on phones,
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:56.320]   go put Mario Kart on some phones.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.560]   - Sega ended up doing right.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.600]   - Exactly, they couldn't hack the hardware business.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.000]   The hardware business was dragging them down,
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.400]   they almost died, they brought back,
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:06.280]   they brought the brand back as a software business license.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:08.560]   The IP did all kinds of stuff like that on the software side.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.080]   - Those would be massive,
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:11.840]   they got like Mario and Zelda on iPhone.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.440]   - It'd be outrageous.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.280]   - That's all I would do.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.280]   - They would be huge.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.720]   They would make more money on that.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:17.560]   - Instant.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.400]   - I know, Pokemon.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:21.040]   - I think it's a very Japanese way of approaching the problem.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.160]   You know, they're trying to control it and end.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.760]   - Get out of the hardware business.
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:26.360]   Get out of the hardware business.
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.680]   Tom Merritt's speaking of TNT,
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.680]   Tom Merritt's across the room,
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.280]   but he's gonna do this on video.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.360]   (laughs)
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.920]   I saw him come in.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.600]   What's coming up next week?
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.280]   Or this week, the week ahead with Tom Merritt
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.960]   from Tech News today.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.760]   - In New York City, that's a look at the week ahead.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:42.600]   Back to you later.
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.760]   (laughs)
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.960]   It was short.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:45.800]   It was a short week.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:46.640]   - Did you catch it?
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.480]   - It was a short week ahead.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.560]   (laughs)
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.400]   Let me listen.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.480]   Let me start over.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.640]   (laughs)
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:54.120]   - Hey, thanks Leo, here's a look at
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:55.680]   what we'll be covering on Tech News today
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:56.640]   in the week ahead.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.880]   Today, Sunday, July 31st,
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:01.040]   all Google profiles go public.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.880]   We'll see if there's any fallout from that.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.120]   Also today, the Motorola Photon 4G
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.640]   comes to sprint for $200 on contracts.
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.160]   And a lot of stuff happening today.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.000]   Pottermore opens for registration
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.240]   if you're a Harry Potter fan,
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.520]   only way to get the eBooks.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.320]   And Sony ID theft protection
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:18.160]   had been extended to today, July 31st.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.200]   So scramble if you wanna sign up for that.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.640]   Coming up on Wednesday, August 3rd,
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.760]   Blackberry Fan Night happens in Toronto.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.480]   It might be our first look at Blackberry OS 7.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:29.080]   T-Mobile makes the HTC Wildfire S official
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.080]   available for 80 bucks on Wednesday.
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:34.240]   And finally on Wednesday, Samsung's TouchWiz UX update
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.080]   for the Tab 10.1 is available.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:39.040]   But only in person, if you show up at their press event
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:39.880]   in New York City.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.840]   That's a look at the week ahead, back to you Leo.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.720]   - There you go, Tom Merritt.
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.560]   Thank you.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.760]   TNT is on Twitter every Monday through Friday.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:49.440]   230, Pacific 530 Eastern.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.760]   That would be 2130 UTC at live.twit.
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:54.960]   - It's a really good show.
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:55.800]   You guys should watch it.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.360]   - TV, and I think somebody named Sarah Lean
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.760]   might appear on that show along with IAC Tarr.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.560]   So Twitter, I didn't know this,
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.320]   'cause I had been using Google+,
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.400]   has started injecting paid tweets into the stream.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.560]   That was the thing everybody said
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.640]   that will be the end of Twitter when they do it.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:12.880]   - But it's, so they're injecting tweets into the stream
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.400]   if you follow a brand.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.840]   - Oh, so you have to follow them.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.680]   - Right, right.
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.600]   - So if I'm following--
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.880]   - Wouldn't I see it anyway?
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.720]   I don't understand.
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.240]   - You would, but now they pin it basically to the top
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.200]   when you load a page for the first time
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:25.840]   or if you reload it, you'll see it again.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.680]   - Well, that's not so bad.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:27.520]   - And then it gets pushed out.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.280]   - If I don't follow JetBlue in this example,
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:31.400]   I don't see this even if it's a paid tweet.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:32.240]   - That's right.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.080]   - But then-- - But you're kind of
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:33.920]   opting in and away.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:34.760]   - Right.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.800]   - But then the next phase will be what--
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.640]   - Right.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.760]   - Well, when they don't make any money on this.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.640]   - Twitter seems to be struggling.
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:43.440]   They've fired a bunch of people.
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.560]   They brought back Jack Dorsey,
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.040]   even though he has a real job with Square.
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:51.120]   I don't understand how he can run two companies,
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:51.960]   but anyway.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:52.880]   - They're really close to each other.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.360]   He just walks a few blocks.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.200]   - Is it really?
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.040]   He's walked down the street.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:57.360]   Okay, this is Twitter--
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.200]   - That's how you do it.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.040]   - I just make sure-- - We're in the morning,
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:32:59.880]   Twitter in the afternoon. - Twitter in the afternoon.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:01.720]   - I'm gonna put all the things in here, right?
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.960]   - What, I don't know if Google+
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:04.840]   is gonna put them out of business,
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.360]   but they seem like they've really been struggling to make a--
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:10.360]   - Well, they're raising yet more money.
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.320]   They'll be around for a long time,
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.640]   but they do need to figure out how to make money,
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.160]   and this is the most significant step forward yet to do that.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:19.760]   They keep trying these little things.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:24.360]   They have the promoted topics in the trending area.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.640]   They have it in the search, and now--
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.760]   - The problem is no one sees that
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.280]   because third party apps don't show.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.240]   - Well, are you even gonna see these promoted tweets now?
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240]   If you're using a client-- - I guess you will.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.600]   - No, not yet. - The guy who's the ex-
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.520]   - I don't know what to say either.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.360]   - Oh, it doesn't come into the client.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:35.760]   - It's only on Twitter.com right now.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:36.600]   They will pump it through there.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.080]   - They make it my official client at least.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.480]   - But Twitter.com is the biggest client.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.120]   - Yes, right. - In terms of the share of--
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.280]   - Right, right. - What people are--
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.200]   - Yeah, yeah. - So it's a good way
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.320]   to test the theory. - I think if that works.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.440]   - Yeah, it seems like-- - For the real domain API level.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:49.280]   - I don't know about you guys.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.360]   I don't follow too many brands,
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.640]   but I'm sure there's a few I follow.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.080]   And it's like, if I'm already following a brand
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.000]   to have it show up a little bit more prominently
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.360]   in my stream, I'm already asking to get a place.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.840]   - Well, it's like a fine idea.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:02.000]   It's just, is that aggressive enough for them
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.160]   to actually make a legitimate amount of money?
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.600]   You know, like, how much would you pay for that?
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.320]   - I bet that at least in the beginning it will be
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.600]   'cause brands won't know any better.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.440]   - Right. - Like, oh, this sounds
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.280]   like a really great idea. - Right, right, right.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.640]   - It was $50,000 to have my tweet up there for 24 hours.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.440]   - They say they're measuring engagement though
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.160]   in an interesting way because they do more
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.120]   than just click throughs.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.680]   It's also the number of retweets
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.800]   and the number of times it's favored,
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.040]   which is kind of an interesting metric.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.960]   - See, I favor stuff all the time as a bookmarking.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.440]   - People use it for different reasons.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.200]   - So it's not, they shouldn't really--
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:31.640]   - But that's how they charge,
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:33.520]   they only charge the advertisers
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.280]   when one of those three things happens.
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.800]   - I think Twitter's also smart enough to know
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.720]   that if they were just to start injecting sponsored tweets
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.040]   into our timelines, everyone would go batch it.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.360]   - Like the dick bar? - Crap.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.280]   (laughing)
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.760]   Sorry for the estate work.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.360]   I myself included, so it's like if you just,
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.280]   if you start small and you get a certain amount of people
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:56.400]   used to seeing this kind of thing,
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.640]   then there's less to be up in arms about
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:00.200]   when they start popping up.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.120]   - Right.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.000]   I think the funny thing on Twitter is--
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.160]   - There's just a rush. - People will follow you
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.440]   on Twitter unless you start posting things.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.320]   And then as soon as you start using Twitter,
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.960]   people get irate, it's happened to me.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.920]   It just happened to President Obama.
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.280]   - Yeah, right.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.840]   - So he posted because of course we've got this thing,
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:18.240]   the debt ceiling deadlock, which could be pretty bad.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.920]   On Friday afternoon, he has nine million followers.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:22.920]   He told him to tweet your congressman,
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.480]   your Republican congressman,
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.080]   to promote a bipartisan solution to the deficit crisis.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:31.720]   And then he began tweeting out the Twitter handles
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:35.320]   of Republican Congressman's state by state.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:39.440]   In one day, he lost 37,000 followers
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.840]   because nobody wants that. - That's right.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:41.840]   - That's noise. - Hey, you,
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.240]   keep it down, whoever you--
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.800]   - Hey, hey, president. - Hey, you guys.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.720]   - Hey, president, stop it. - Chris Bamben me.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.600]   - It's happened to me. - It's happened to me.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.400]   I understand.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.520]   Barack, it's okay.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.480]   Don't come back.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.720]   Actually, it turns out the Republicans gained
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:55.360]   many of these followers.
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.280]   - Yeah, he helped their accounts.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.000]   - It's like, you know what, you're so annoying,
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.680]   I'm gonna vote against the compromise.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.680]   - Well, I kept reading the headlines wrong
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.040]   and seeing something like Barack Obama, Twitter compromise.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.760]   I was like, oh my God, did his account get hacked?
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.720]   I was like, oh wait, that's not what that means at all.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.360]   - Did he not have to compromise?
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:14.200]   - What?
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.560]   - Yes, he got hacked. - Yes, he got hacked.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.280]   - Three years ago. - Yes, he did right.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.800]   - And that came back to him. - He's one of them.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:20.880]   - I don't know, I think that whole thing
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.800]   is kind of silly though, like 37,000.
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.440]   - It's not a lot out of mine, really.
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.400]   - You can lose that on just any given day
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.840]   when Twitter shuts down spam accounts.
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.800]   - Mm-hmm. - That's like a third
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.880]   of a percent, I just did the math on that.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.120]   It's a very, I don't know.
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.280]   - I would expect to lose more than that
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.480]   if I were doing something like that.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.360]   - You would. - On my Twitter account.
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.800]   - You would, and you don't have 9 million followers.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.560]   - Exactly. - You have 8 million.
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.080]   Lady Gaga has 12 million. - 12 million.
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:46.280]   - Maybe he should hire her to do that.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:48.160]   - You know who's gonna get a lot of followers?
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.320]   - Lady Big Mac, watch this.
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.320]   (cheering)
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.160]   - Come back!
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.560]   (cheering)
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.720]   - I'm gonna assume, I'm gonna assume by now
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:57.800]   you're all familiar with Twitter,
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.360]   the social networking site that has become
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.360]   an increasingly popular outlet for news
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.600]   about Justin Bieber and popular revolutions.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.240]   Did you also know it's a great newsroom
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:08.640]   feedback delivery system?
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.040]   - We've been asking you all morning
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.280]   what your favorite fast food guilty pleasure is.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:14.280]   - Well, Lady Big Mac, on Twitter,
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.280]   five guys burgers and fries.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.280]   - Wait, what?
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.280]   (laughing)
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.280]   Five guys is Lady Big Mac's favorite burger place?
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.280]   Isn't that like the Quaker Oats Guide
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.280]   doing an ad campaign for Farina?
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.280]   (laughing)
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.280]   - It's good. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.280]   - They're fine.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:32.280]   They got 24 hours to fill, they're just having
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.280]   a little bit of fun.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.280]   At least the level of Twitter questions
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.280]   is at the preferred choice in chopped meat sandwich chain level.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:40.280]   - We wanna know if politicians' private transgression
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.280]   matter to their public life.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.280]   Lady Big Mac, I'd put her stuff.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.280]   - She's back!
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.280]   - Decision by the president and not to go public
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.280]   with the Bin Laden death photos.
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.280]   We wanna know what you think about the president's decision.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:52.280]   Lady Big Mac, what does it say?
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280]   - Yeah.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.280]   - It doesn't mean right.
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.280]   We do not need to see anything.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.280]   - So who is Lady Big Mac?
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.280]   (laughing)
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.280]   - You have a Lady Big Mac?
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.280]   - All right, I don't know why you're trying anymore.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.280]   - You got to fill up her profiles.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.280]   I actually, I saw this the other night
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.280]   when I was watching the Daily Show.
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.280]   - Yeah.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.280]   - I went and pulled up the profiles pretty funny.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.280]   It's like, she's like a grandmother or something.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.280]   - But she doesn't look that old.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.280]   - That's pretty funny.
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.280]   - Oh, no.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.280]   - Let me get my picture.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.280]   - That picture looks like it's from the 70s, so maybe.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.280]   - No, I mean, her about thing, I think, says she is a grandma.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:19.280]   - I think she calls it out.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.280]   - Well, good for her.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:21.280]   She's using the social opinion.
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.280]   - Yeah, wife, mother, grand.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.280]   - That's awesome.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.280]   - So, for the news.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.280]   - And to be fair, I had five guys for the first time last week.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.280]   - You had five guys last week?
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.280]   - It was awesome.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:29.280]   - Oh, the burgers.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.280]   - Leo.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.280]   - No, I'm sorry.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.280]   I wasn't paying attention.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.280]   I picked up on that.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.280]   - You know, we were right in the dirty.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.280]   - All I heard was I had five guys last week.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.280]   - Not everybody outside of California knows that five guys is a burgers plate.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:44.280]   - It is.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.280]   - And I had never had a bad plan.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.280]   - I have not heard the ears before.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:50.280]   - It's funny that you would defend Lady Big Mac by saying, "Well, you know, actually,
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.280]   five guys are pretty good."
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.280]   There she is, Ruth Lady Big Mac, lower Alabama, wife, mother, grandmother,
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.280]   retired bookkeeper, and political junkie.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.280]   Apparently somebody who's very good at getting on the network news.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.280]   - She watches a lot of news.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:06.280]   - You gotta wonder the researchers that they must have at the Daily Show
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.280]   to go through all that video and find like five mentions of Lady Big Mac.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.280]   - Right.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:15.280]   - There was that whole clip if you're a Daily Show fan.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.280]   - It's very funny.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.280]   - And that's our fair use to fans.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:21.280]   - How many funny followers did she gain?
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:22.280]   - Oh, I don't know.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.280]   She doesn't know.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:25.280]   - She only has 24 hundred followers.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.280]   - Honestly, though, I think sock puppet.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.280]   - What?
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.280]   - I think she's real.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.280]   - No, I think I think she's real.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.280]   - I think she's real.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.280]   - No, no, no, I think it's like probably an account that CNN set up.
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.280]   - It's Jason, they could like say something.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.280]   That would be awesome.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.280]   - That would be so awesome.
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.280]   - Let's do this.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:44.280]   - I want everybody watching or listening to Twit right now to follow Lady Big Mac.
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:45.280]   - Oh, what are we still doing?
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.280]   - These...
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.280]   - Why not?
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.280]   - Experiments.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.280]   - Let's just do it.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.280]   - Okay.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.280]   - I'm gonna follow her.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.280]   - I'll follow her.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.280]   - Did you get the count before?
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.280]   - Yeah, 2401.
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:55.280]   - But she tweets about all sorts of stuff.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.280]   I don't think she uses CNN accounts.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:57.280]   - Look, follow her.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.280]   Oh, what, this is nice.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.280]   - She retweeted Will Wheaton.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.280]   - Follow her today.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.280]   You can unfollow her tomorrow.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.280]   I just want to see how big we can get Lady Big Mac.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:07.280]   - Ryan, I'm with you though that I think a lot of these people may just be...
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.280]   - She's...
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:09.280]   - I think a lot of...
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.280]   - Is she sharing all mechanisms to get the sound by that you are?
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.280]   - I think a lot.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.280]   - I think you're right.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.280]   - Why not?
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:17.280]   - I want a Twit pick of her looking just like that with like her family.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.280]   - With a newspaper.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:19.280]   - Yeah, with a newspaper.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.280]   - Hold up a newspaper with today's dinner.
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.280]   - Proof of life.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.280]   - Yeah.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:25.280]   - No, actually, wouldn't that be though if that would be a huge scandal?
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.280]   I mean, it's not exactly, you know, the news of the world level scandal.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:33.280]   But a huge scandal if you found out that CBS, ABC and NBC were making fake Twitter accounts.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:36.280]   - That's like the fake movie reviewers, you know, who are you doing the...
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.280]   - On the other hand, for some reason, maybe I'm just a cynic.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.280]   - Boy Lady Big Mac, her email inbox, if she has notifications on.
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.280]   - Oh my God.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:43.280]   - We did that.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:46.280]   - When we did Lisa Tickle Pink, she thought she did something wrong because she was getting
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.280]   thousands and thousands.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   I think I'm done.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.280]   I don't want to.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.280]   We've done everything.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.280]   We played John Stewart.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.280]   - You're right.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.280]   - You're right.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   - We played a little chameleon here.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:04.280]   Boo has a book.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.280]   - Boo the dog and the bee is boo.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.280]   - I love boo.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:08.280]   - I never heard a boo.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.280]   - Is that that poofy?
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.280]   - It's a bangs versus beard thing.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.280]   - Look at that dog.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.280]   - He is pretty cute.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.280]   - Oh, no.
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.280]   - I know that dog.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:20.280]   - In case you don't think Boo is real, here's a video of Boo.
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.280]   The cutest dog in the world.
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.280]   - I think he's not too bright.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.280]   - I don't know.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:30.280]   - I don't know.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:31.280]   - I do too, actually.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.280]   - And I love the videos.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.280]   - Yeah.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:35.280]   - He's got a book.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.280]   - I love him, love him.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.280]   - But you know, aren't they brushing his hair to make him look like a football?
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.280]   - Yes, he's getting groomed specifically to be cute.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:47.280]   - Oh, Chad, we're now talking about Mr. Winkles, also a pretty darn cute dog.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.280]   - That's Boo's head.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   - I don't know Mr. Winkles.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.280]   - He was the predecessor to Boo.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:51.280]   - Wait a minute, Sue.
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:52.280]   - Oh, there's somebody before.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.280]   Okay, we got to look at Mr. Winkles.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.280]   - Yeah, Mr. Winkles.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.280]   - Boo was inspired by Mr. Winkles.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.280]   - Mr. Winkles is the OG cute dog on the internet.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:59.280]   - I see.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:00.280]   - Yeah, you know what?
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.280]   I don't know Boo.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.280]   I knew Mr. Winkles.
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:03.280]   - What?
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.280]   - I thought that--
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:05.280]   - Mr. Winkles.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:06.280]   - I thought that--
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:07.280]   - Why knew Boo?
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:08.280]   And you are no Boo.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.280]   - You sir.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.280]   - Missed.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:11.280]   - I know Boo.
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.280]   - Apparently Mr. Winkle is the cutest dog in the universe.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.280]   - Yes, see?
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.280]   - Wow, I'll just--
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.280]   - And so the world is not nothing.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.280]   This is the ugliest sight in the universe.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.280]   - Wait, wait, wait.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.280]   - They should run this through the Google speed up.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:25.280]   - It's coming on his magic saucer.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.280]   - He's having his magic saucer.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280]   - He's ready for it.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:30.280]   - Is this like a hamster dance or something?
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.280]   Good Lord, there's a lot of suspense.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:33.280]   Thanks for waiting.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.280]   - You ready to go?
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:35.280]   - Would they have a generate Mr. Winkle?
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:36.280]   - It counts like a--
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.280]   - He looks just like Mr. Boo.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.280]   - Yeah.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:39.280]   - Wait.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.280]   - It looks like Mr. Boo with a wonky hat.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.280]   - How can he be the cutest dog in the universe
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:44.280]   if he looks just like the cutest dog in the world?
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.280]   - I'm confused now.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.280]   - Why is this happening?
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.280]   - Why is this happening?
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.280]   - Why is this happening?
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:49.280]   - Why is this happening?
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:50.280]   - Why is this happening?
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:51.280]   - Why?
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:52.280]   - Alien, Sifan.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.280]   - Is this a box?
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.280]   (laughter)
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.280]   - I think he's definitely a Sifan.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.280]   - This is the ugliest sight I have ever seen in my life.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:00.280]   - It's actually--
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:01.280]   - You know, there's only one--
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.280]   - It's sort of wonderful at some point.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:03.280]   - So what breed of dog is this?
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:04.280]   - Does anyone know?
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.280]   - What is the breed?
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.280]   - Pomeranian?
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.280]   - Is it a pomeranian?
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.280]   - It's a pomeranian, but--
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.280]   - With his car a certain way.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.280]   - The only thing that would make this site better--
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.280]   - Is making cute dogs.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:15.280]   - Is comic sans.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:17.280]   (laughter)
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.280]   Now we've got an audience.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.280]   He's a pomeranian left in the dryer too.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.280]   - I think they're gonna take the death.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:26.280]   - All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank our panel for making this a fabulous--
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:29.280]   - We're gonna put food, Mr. Wickle, in a dog fight.
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.280]   - Engage match.
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:31.280]   - Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.280]   - That's horrible.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:33.280]   - Somebody call Michael Vick.
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.280]   (laughter)
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:36.280]   - Oh, he doesn't do that anymore.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:38.280]   - I know, he's reformed.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.280]   - Yes.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.280]   - Too soon.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.280]   - Did you see that Fox Con runs to replace--
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.280]   - It's a crowd.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:46.280]   - It has a million workers, and they want to replace them with robots in the next three
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:47.280]   years.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.280]   - Yeah, but then you've got to have rehired them to take care of the robots.
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:50.280]   - Somebody has to maintain the robots.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.280]   - Yeah.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.280]   - Who's building the robots?
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.840]   If you were in China right now, I'd get a degree in robot building.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:56.840]   That's the future.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.280]   - And then you have to have the security force on hand in case the robots revolt.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.280]   - Yeah.
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:05.280]   - Oh, I can't stop without mentioning this, 'cause we gave Apple such a hard time over
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.000]   the location database, right?
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.720]   Apple's iPhone was collecting information so they could build a skyhook-like service.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.120]   Same thing Google was doing.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:18.680]   Turns out Microsoft also has been doing the same thing in the Windows Phone 7, gathering
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:25.080]   data from Wi-Fi connections along with the GPS information to create a database so that
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.200]   you can use Wi-Fi instead of GPS.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.680]   But this is kind of funny.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.680]   Microsoft left the database open to everybody.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:33.680]   - Oh, good.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:39.680]   - So apparently, if you want to know where you've been or your boyfriend's been or your
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.680]   husband's been--
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:42.680]   - Mm, this could come in handy.
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:43.680]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:47.160]   - And all you need is their MAC address and you can find out.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.160]   What's your MAC address?
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.160]   - You too.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.920]   - Here's my question.
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:55.160]   How come Apple got so much heat when they did this?
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.160]   And this story's been sitting on Gizmodo for four days, nobody's picked it up.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.800]   - Well, I think there's some different-- there's some aspects about this or different.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:06.880]   If I read it correctly, it was that if your-- it only works if your phone was put into
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:12.160]   Wi-Fi hotspot mode and then I guess only if, like, they scanned it.
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.160]   - Declan the call.
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:14.160]   - In the location database.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:15.160]   - You guys who discovered this.
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.160]   - So it's like it's definitely not--
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:18.160]   - I think the other issue--
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:21.680]   - It's not like you have a minute by minute, day by day tracking, where everyone is going.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:25.160]   I think it's just points in time under specific circumstances.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:28.160]   It's not good, but it'd be a lot worse.
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:31.160]   - And the other issue is who the hell's using Windows Phone 7?
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:32.160]   (laughing)
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.160]   - Small amount of very satisfied custom versions.
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.160]   - Yeah, it's--
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.160]   - No, I'm gunful.
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.160]   - But we all really like Windows Phone.
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.160]   - But we like it.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.160]   - Yeah.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.160]   - All right, I'm--
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.160]   - Does that dig at me?
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.160]   - What?
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.160]   - Veronica's the greatest, she's on "Texilla."
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:50.160]   Watch it, T-E-K, Z-Z-I-L-L-A dialogue.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.160]   - Are you Tom now with the--
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.160]   - Does he do that too?
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:53.160]   - Yeah.
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:54.160]   - Yeah.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.160]   - Does he spell color with a U?
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.160]   - He--we have a statement on "T" called the rumor mill, which is spelled--
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:00.160]   - The U?
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160]   - I saw that.
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.160]   - It's ridiculous.
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.160]   - Is that 'cause a Tom thing?
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:04.160]   - It's a Tom thing.
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.160]   - Lady Big Mac just tweeted.
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:06.160]   What did she say?
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:07.160]   - What did she say?
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.160]   - All you new followers?
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:09.160]   I don't know.
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.160]   What you're expecting?
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.160]   I'm an angry, opinionated grandma that tweets about politics and get them involved.
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.160]   - I don't know what she's saying.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:18.160]   - I'm an angry, opinionated grandma that tweets about politics and getting involved.
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:19.160]   - That's so funny.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:21.160]   She does have a thousand new followers.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:23.160]   - And now she's involved in our world.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:24.160]   - So you have a choice.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.160]   You can't get it.
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:30.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:33.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:34.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:36.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:37.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:38.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.160]   - I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:46.160]   - She does have a thousand new followers.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.160]   - And now she's involved in our world.
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:49.160]   - So you have a choice.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.160]   You could buy a brick or follow Lady Big Mac.
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:52.160]   You'd say, you'd choose.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:53.160]   Veronica, thank you for being here.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:54.160]   It's great to have you in the new brick house studio.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.160]   - Thank you for having me.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.160]   It looks fantastic here.
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.160]   - Thanks for bringing this guy up here too.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.160]   'Cause I know you drive, right?
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.160]   - I do.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.160]   - Yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.160]   - Well, you drive sometimes too, but it's--
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.160]   - No, I could just see him going along.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.160]   It's so humiliating.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:05.160]   - In the backseat.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.160]   - Well, you're driving.
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:07.160]   - He sticks his head out the window as he was flat.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.160]   It's great.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.160]   - I really appreciate you being here.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:12.160]   Mr. M.G. Seagler from TechCrunch.com.
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:14.160]   Still, they're best writer.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.160]   - Thank you.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.160]   - I like the other guys too.
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.160]   They're okay.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.160]   But you're good.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.160]   You're real.
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:20.160]   - He's the smartest.
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:21.160]   - How many times you file every day?
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.160]   - Like 10 times a day.
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:23.160]   - No, not that often.
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:25.160]   I used to write a lot more.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.160]   Now I do longer, so it's--
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.160]   - Oh, you're doing the think pieces.
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.160]   - Yes.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:33.160]   - So the gut and immediate gut reaction piece.
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:35.160]   You're thinking, you're pondering, you're
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:40.160]   congitating, you're collecting your facts.
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.160]   - I don't know if I'd go that far, but yeah.
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:46.160]   - The gut reactions are still on your Twitter feed.
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:48.160]   - There is lemon if you want to find the gut reactions.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.160]   And of course, Sarah Lane, who will be back tomorrow with
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.160]   Tech News today.
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.160]   Thank you for--
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.160]   - Of course, social hour in the morning too.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:55.160]   - Social hour at 11 a.m.
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.160]   - That's right.
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:57.160]   - Pacific, 2 p.m.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:58.160]   Eastern, 1800 UTC.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.160]   @SarahLane on the Twitter, SarahLane.com.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.160]   You still doing SarahLane.com?
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.160]   - Yeah, I have a--
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.160]   I just want to put my iPad on my iPad the other day,
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:07.160]   because I have never really done that.
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:08.160]   When I say, "Ah, you know, the keyboard's okay
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:09.160]   for short form stuff."
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.160]   But what if I actually want to write something that's,
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.160]   I don't know, a thousand words on my iPad?
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:14.160]   - That's a lot of work.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.160]   - I haven't finished yet.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:16.160]   - That's a lot of work.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:17.160]   - Yeah, it's quite a project.
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:18.160]   - Thank you all for watching the show.
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.160]   We really appreciate your being here.
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:21.160]   I hope you like the new TwitBrick House.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.160]   Understand this is still our field test.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.160]   We haven't worked out of the kinks.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:27.160]   Yeah, I know there are little issues with audio and so forth,
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:29.160]   but I do appreciate your patience.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.160]   And I do thank you so much for watching.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.160]   If you haven't bought a brick, go to bricks.twit.tv.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.160]   You too can be on the wall right behind me.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.160]   You'd actually be able to see the bricks through the gear here,
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.160]   bricks.twit.tv.
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:44.160]   That helps build the best little studio in the whole wide world.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:46.160]   See you next time.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:48.160]   On, what do I say at the end of Twit?
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.160]   Another Twit.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.160]   I gotta go to the bathroom.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:51.160]   It's in the camera.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.160]   [laughter]
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.160]   See you later, everybody.
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:55.160]   - Bye, everybody.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:58.160]   [music]
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:48:59.160]   - Twit.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.160]   - Do on the Twit.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.160]   - All right.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:02.160]   - Do on the Twit, baby.
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.160]   - Do on the Twit.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.160]   - All right.
