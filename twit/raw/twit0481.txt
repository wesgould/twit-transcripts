[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.200]   But a very interesting week.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.280]   And fortunately, we have a very accomplished panel to help us dissect it.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.760]   Starting, let's see, we'll start all the way with our senior member, Philip Elmer-Dewitt.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.560]   For many years, he's been at fortune.com writing about technology.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.400]   But he is actually one of the senior members of the tech journalist,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.160]   Klann, started time.com, started time's technology coverage,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.960]   and worked at Bolt, Baranek, and Newman in the early days of the internet.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.320]   Philip, welcome.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.720]   Thank you.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.400]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.960]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.560]   And you probably can tell just looking at him that he's in Massachusetts.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.200]   I've got my Massachusetts shirt on.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.560]   And the room is heated by a fireplace.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.320]   It's one in every room.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.840]   It is.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.320]   It is.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.920]   I could tell.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.240]   I grew up in Rhode Island.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.800]   I know what these things are like.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.400]   Also, from Taiwan, joining us, the man in charge of Stretechari, Ben Thompson,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.960]   always great to have Ben on.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.400]   Good to have you.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.560]   What time in the morning is it?
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.360]   Six in the morning.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.440]   Thank you for getting up early.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.520]   I can't thank you enough.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.960]   No worries.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.440]   Happy to be here.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.120]   We love having you.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.440]   And Stretechari is a great, very insightful blog about the tech industry.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.200]   It's kind of a must read.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.240]   And finally, from the Mac Observer, great to have Dave Hamilton,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   back founder of the Mac Observer.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.920]   He does the GeekMacGeekAb podcast.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.960]   Say that 10 times fast.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.760]   MacGeekAb-- yeah.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.880]   Did you think about that when you named it?
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.600]   I did not.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.920]   No.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.840]   But now I can say MacGeekAb and my sleep.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.360]   So--
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.880]   Good.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   Just one of those things.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.000]   Yeah, Twit.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.680]   It's easy.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.280]   Twit.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.880]   I know.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.880]   See, you thought about--
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.280]   I thought about--
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.520]   It's not your first rodeo.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.240]   Not my first rodeo.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   No tongue twisters here.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.200]   So since we've got somebody from China, this is actually--
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.320]   we're going to start with kind of not one of the top stories,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.800]   but still an interesting story.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.040]   Mark Zuckerberg in Beijing meeting with--
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.320]   are talking to-- who's he talking to, Chinese people?
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.880]   I guess.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.440]   Yeah, at someone university.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.600]   And you just waded into it by calling it
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.960]   someone in China when I'm in Taiwan.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.080]   Oh, God, no.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.560]   He's not in China.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.240]   He's into Taiwan.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.000]   I was not-- see, now you're in the middle of it,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.120]   because now you just--
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   Now I'm going the other way.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.240]   --with the other half of your eyes.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.200]   I've swung the other way.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.680]   I forgot, yeah, you're in Taiwan,
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.040]   which the Taiwanese considered China.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.560]   No, it's complicated.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.480]   Yeah, I believe the official US status, anyway,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.800]   is that it's undetermined.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.240]   So-- Oh, great.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.080]   Easiest, easiest to leave it there.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.840]   He's in Taiwan.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.160]   That's what we really need to say.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.240]   So in the middle of this talk, he starts speaking Chinese.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.760]   We do the whole thing in Chinese.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.240]   30 minutes.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.120]   Yeah, Blue Everyone's in the mind.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.720]   I immediately asked him to introduce himself.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.800]   He starts speaking Chinese.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.360]   They loved it.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.440]   He'd switched to English.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.240]   And he never did.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.680]   He did the whole thing in Chinese.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.880]   The thing that's amazing about the Chinese people
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.200]   in general, my experience-- I studied Chinese in college--
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.840]   is you can have the most excreable Chinese, the worst
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   accent in the world.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.800]   And they, too a man, will say, oh, you sound great.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.160]   You sound really good, right?
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.920]   No, absolutely.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.160]   I mean, it was actually--
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.600]   I thought it was very, very impressive.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.240]   Let's hear Mark speak Chinese.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.600]   Batesville.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   Batesville.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.240]   I mean, he sounds like an American speaking Chinese.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.040]   He said my Chinese is very terrible.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.080]   And I said, that's not wrong.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.400]   Basically, he has a very impressive vocabulary.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.840]   But his pronunciation is very poor.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.440]   He's not getting the tones, it sounds like.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.760]   Right.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.720]   He has no tones at all.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.720]   No tones.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.640]   So they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.840]   Those are three different words.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.280]   And he just kind of all says it to say.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.280]   Whoa.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.640]   Basically, it makes sense.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.040]   It sounds like someone who studies quite a bit on their own.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.880]   But very rarely, he has a tutor or speaks to someone
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.640]   who actually regularly--
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.320]   Can I just say, it's damn impressive.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.160]   No, it's amazing.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.840]   He's a man who kills and dresses his own meat.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.880]   Runs one of the biggest companies in the world
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.040]   is easily the richest person under 30--
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.920]   actually, I guess he's 30 now.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   But for many years, the richest person under 30.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.240]   And, oh, by the way, he's been studying Chinese in his sleep.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.240]   No, yeah.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   It's fair time.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   It's incredibly impressive.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.840]   And I thought people giving him-- especially, you know,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.680]   the whole, like, white people want to show
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.040]   they're good at Chinese, giving him crap about it.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.400]   I thought it was--
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.000]   what was-- yeah, I don't think it was very fair.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.880]   And I think it was-- you're right.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.760]   I found, just speaking a little bit of Chinese,
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.920]   is everyone's yes, it's great.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.520]   But there's also, I think, there's
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.640]   a lot of appreciation for it.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   I think particularly in China, again, this is--
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.480]   they appreciate the effort.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.680]   Well, it's not just that.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.320]   I think with the risk of waiting into these sort of things,
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.760]   I think there's going to be a sense in China, you know,
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.000]   that like there--
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.600]   we used to be kind of the center of the world economy, which
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.280]   is true.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.400]   And we've been held back in the last few years.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.640]   And now, like, we're regaining a rightful place.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.600]   And to have someone of Zuckerberg's stature,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.240]   I come to have clearly spent the time
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.320]   to come in and speak Chinese.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   I'm certain, tremendous amount of goodwill.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.920]   And I don't think it's going to get Facebook unblocked in China.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.200]   But I could not be more impressed and think
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.560]   that there was nothing but upside as far as him in China goes.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.880]   And I think all the people saying is,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.280]   you spoke like a seven-year-old.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.720]   So I'm like, why, he's a seven-year-old.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.040]   So--
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.760]   That ain't bad.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.280]   I'd be glad to speak as a Chinese seven-year-old.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.160]   His wife, Priscilla, is Chinese.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.480]   But is she of Chinese ancestry?
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.520]   She's Cantonese, actually, from Hong Kong, which I was surprised
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.240]   he mentioned that she spoke Chinese.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.600]   I actually looked it up.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.800]   I don't think-- I think she mostly speaks Cantonese,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.000]   which is--
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Very different language.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.160]   Just like French to English.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.360]   It's not.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.960]   Yeah, it's like in the same general family,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.080]   but it's definitely a different language.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.560]   But with Nake said, his Chinese sound
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.440]   of like he doesn't really speak it.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.760]   He more practices a lot.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.640]   But as I said, it's incredibly impressive.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.880]   I think-- I don't think there is--
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.960]   I have nothing but great things to say about it.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.320]   He's got book learning.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.360]   Yeah, no, that's exactly what it sounded like.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.040]   You know what impressed me was that he was cracking wise
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.600]   and getting big laughs.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.680]   I mean, this was a guy who was very uncomfortable on stage
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.080]   in his native language, and that he was able to--
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.960]   It's a good point.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.600]   He was like a comedian.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.080]   He was like doing stand-up.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.680]   He's much more comfortable speaking in Chinese
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.600]   than he is in English.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.000]   That's a very good point.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.480]   He's come a long way in general.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.520]   But yeah, I think just in general,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.560]   that I think is a great example.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.720]   I mean, I think there's lots of people in any language,
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.720]   but I think it tends to be a challenge in this culture
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.560]   that if you're not perfect, you're not doing it exactly right,
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.280]   very fearful to kind of step out and do it.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.080]   And he was not perfect, but he did it.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.600]   And I thought it was awesome.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:24.800]   So--
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.280]   Sure, Jung-Wong.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.600]   So let's listen a little more.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.920]   I just want to hear a little more of Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.280]   The audience loves-- and if you're making
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.880]   a joke in another language, that's
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.600]   pretty good grasp of the language.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   [SPEAKING CHINESE]
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.440]   [SPEAKING CHINESE]
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.440]   Somehow.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.600]   He sounds like the Apple iPhone stream.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.720]   Oh, sorry, that was just a bad joke.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.040]   Speaking of China, Tim Cook went to China.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.440]   I don't think he was speaking Chinese to the vice premier.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.120]   We kind of speculated that the CEO of Apple
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.640]   went to China because China, or somebody somehow in China,
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.480]   the great firewall of China was blocking, actually,
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.400]   intercepting traffic to iCloud.com, along with live.com,
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.200]   capturing the login and then passing Chinese nationals
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.080]   along to iCloud, presumably to gather credentials
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.160]   to the iCloud server.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.640]   This was discovered by greatfire.org,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.760]   one of the watchdog groups that monitors
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.520]   the great firewall of China.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.080]   The Chinese government immediately denied it, said,
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.440]   wasn't us, although it's hard to imagine who might have been
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.040]   able to do that.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.320]   And very next day, Tim Cook shows up in China.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.960]   And even the Xinhua News Agency even
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.400]   said to talk about telecommunications.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:54.080]   I doubt he was speaking Chinese at the time.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.920]   Also, no, specifically to talk about security issues.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.280]   So the speculation that he flew there just because of this
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.760]   turns out not to be true.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.200]   He's on the same board, the same university that Zuckerberg
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.920]   was on, and he spoke to them as well.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   This was a pre-planned trip.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.040]   He had a lot of Apple things.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.000]   He went to Foxconn, made an appearance there.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.600]   He changed, yeah.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.680]   Yeah, making iPhones as fast as they can.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.560]   He spoke about their renewed commitment
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.560]   to build 40 Apple stores in China, which would, I guess,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.880]   would triple the number of stores they have now.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.160]   But the security issue is an issue.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.960]   And that he got an audience with a vice premier
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.120]   and that they had what the politicians usually call a frank
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.760]   and open discussion, which means they hated each other
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.960]   and yelled.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.960]   It's significant, I think.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.720]   And we'll see what comes of it.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.280]   It's interesting to see the picture of Tim Cook and vice
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.440]   premier Ma Kai together, because it's
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.160]   kind of-- it reminds me very much of the same picture
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.080]   of Richard Nixon with Joe and Lai sitting in the big comfy
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.680]   chairs, stiffly acknowledging each other t
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.120]   between them.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.480]   But you've got to know that this is a very-- here's
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:17.960]   the picture.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.560]   You've got to know this is a very important market for it,
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.760]   not only for Apple, but also if Facebook could get that market
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.800]   for Facebook.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.640]   You may remember at the Apple event,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.560]   Tim Cook spent a fairly long time standing in front
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:40.240]   of the Chinese flag, clearly a photo op talking about the iPhone
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.480]   entering China, and of course this was the iPad event.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.920]   And it is said that he was also very anxious to talk
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.840]   with the Chinese government about Apple Pay.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.360]   Apple Pay.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.520]   And Apple Pay seems to be-- he said that that was--
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.840]   in an interview he gave on the last day, he was there.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.880]   He said that was the number one thing on his agenda.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.240]   That's what he wants to get into China.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:09.120]   And why it wasn't there from day one, we don't know.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.920]   But as soon as 8.1 came out, it worked in America.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.120]   But the phones went on sale in China last week,
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.280]   and Apple Pay wasn't turned on.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.560]   So it's--
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.760]   I'm actually not shocked.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.200]   I mean, if CVS and Rite Aid won't use Apple Pay,
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.400]   I'm not surprised that they won't use it in China.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.440]   There's a few things around here.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.280]   So I mean, first off, China has a different payment network.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.520]   It's called Union Pay.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.640]   They already have a network.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.040]   Is it a tap to pay style network?
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.360]   No, no.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.640]   I mean, MasterCard and Visa are networks that tie banks
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.480]   to merchants.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.960]   Like, they're not actually--
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.000]   like, MeritXpress is separate.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.680]   MeritXpress is an actual bank.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.800]   But China has an equivalent to MasterCard
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.360]   and Visa called Union Pay.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.280]   And there was actually a rumor before the event
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.920]   that Apple had signed agreement with Union Pay.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.040]   I don't know if that's the case or not.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.560]   But they would need to make a deal with a Chinese bank,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.040]   just as they need to make deals with banks in the US.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.760]   They would.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.720]   And I'm sure there's going to be significant challenges
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.760]   when it comes to government approval and regulation.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   And it's interesting, because I want
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.040]   to say that I'm certain that this interception of passwords
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.080]   like that was a coincidence.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.640]   But if it-- Tim Cook certainly did not
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.560]   fight an Apple because this happened.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.000]   You can't-- it's not outside the realm of possibility
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.760]   that the Chinese government did it right before he came
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.360]   to China to send a message.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.720]   To soften him.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.120]   I mean, it's incredibly opaque and complicated environment.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.640]   But as you noted, it's one that's really critical for Apple.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.360]   The reality is, is Apple is the only Western tech company
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.840]   that has a future in China.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.920]   If you're a service like Facebook or anyone else,
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.680]   you're going to be blocked.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.600]   If you're a software provider, like Microsoft was traditionally,
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.200]   you're always just going to be pirated.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.000]   Apple's kind of business model where they sell hardware
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.760]   differentiated by their software makes them actually
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.240]   uniquely equipped to succeed in that economy.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.400]   I'm like pretty much any other, you know,
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.080]   West provider I beg is, the only ones that have been successful
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.560]   have been other hardware manufacturers, like Samsung
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.240]   and stuff like that.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.160]   But now they're-- because they're not really
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.560]   differentiated on the software side,
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.160]   they're struggling right now.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.760]   So Apple has a tremendous opportunity there.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.440]   It's super important to them.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.960]   But on the flip side, that actually
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.920]   means that Apple has a lot more risk in China.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.520]   You saw it happen with the iPhone.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.440]   To me, it's very hard to tell for sure what's happening.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.440]   To me, it was a bit of muscle flexing
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.240]   by the Chinese government, kind of remind
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.520]   Apple who's in charge.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.880]   Again, this is pure conjecture because we don't really
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.560]   know when we can, no one really can know.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.000]   But it's one of the most important relationships
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.960]   in the entire business world to be quite frank.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.360]   And it's going to be really fascinating to watch it
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.000]   and see what happens, how things change.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.560]   And yeah, it's kind of absurd to speculate about, you know,
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.680]   how these weird things might be connected.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.280]   But hey, welcome to China watching.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   Really fascinating.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.800]   And then I guess then it's no accident
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.720]   that sit down with Machai looks so much like
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.520]   Daitant when Richard Nixon reached out to China
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.280]   for the first time.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.240]   It is a business Daitant.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.400]   No, absolutely.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.080]   And the reality is that Apple is one of a whole bunch
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.240]   of companies that have been impacted
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.480]   by the Edward Stone revelations where the US has traditionally
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.240]   been very unfriendly to Chinese technological companies
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.800]   for reasons of suspected espionage.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.840]   So Huawei, for example, was forced to give up on the US market.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.240]   They provide telecommunications equipment.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.000]   And so the US market is basically uncompetitive
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.600]   because you can only buy from from Erickson
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.120]   because Huawei isn't allowed to compete in the US effectively
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.720]   because they're accused of providing, you know,
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.800]   spying for the Chinese government.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.360]   So then you come along and there's tons of examples of this.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.720]   There's a thing about like a Chinese government
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.360]   wanting to buy a port a few years ago
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.640]   or buy like an oil refinery.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.960]   And there's a big uproar in Congress.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.160]   And then this comes along and says,
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.320]   oh, the US is putting back doors in,
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.920]   is doing all these sorts of things.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.840]   And the Chinese government, rather justifiably, is like,
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.200]   wait, what's going on here?
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.480]   You're not giving our companies a fair shake.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.920]   And meanwhile, you're doing the same thing.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.280]   And so a lot of US companies have been pretty significantly
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.120]   impacted in China.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.880]   Microsoft's having a lot of trouble in China right now.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.400]   - Chinese government forbids the use of Windows 8.1 in--
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.840]   - Well, it's not just that.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.680]   They're under like this amorphous antitrust--
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.400]   - Yeah, they're being investigated, that's right.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.480]   - And same with Qualcomm.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.840]   Qualcomm's facing like a billion dollar fine in China.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.640]   And maybe it's one of the things in China,
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.920]   like you can, because stuff, how stuff goes down is out,
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.160]   you're never quite sure.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.920]   You can always be caught on something.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.280]   And meanwhile, in Chinese, in China in general,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.400]   there's this big crackdown on corruption.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.520]   There's the new premier really solidifying power
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.640]   or president, sorry, around himself.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.840]   And so there's really a lot of uncertainty in general.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.800]   And the other thing for Apple is they're very impacted
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.680]   now by the Chinese government.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.880]   It's their third biggest market.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.320]   It's whoa, if it's not their second already,
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.480]   it's gonna be their first in a few years.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.720]   - If they're gonna-- - And Apple,
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.040]   which is stagnating in the iPad business, for instance,
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.480]   they're gonna find growth, they're gonna find it
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.700]   in developing nations and more even than that in China.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.280]   - Well, I mean, the reality is it's just a size thing.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.040]   People talk about it. - It's billions of dollars.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.720]   I remember when the five C came out,
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.040]   people were like, "Oh, that's a month's salary in China."
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.800]   And that was so misplaced because the reality is China's
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.720]   huge over a billion people.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.040]   It has massive inequality.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.680]   If you take-- - If you're a one-percenter
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.600]   in China, you're one of 100 million.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.080]   There's plenty of them.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.920]   - Right, exactly.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.600]   It'd be exactly 10 million.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.880]   - But there's a lot of people that can afford Apple products.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.200]   - Right, in Chinese culture in particular,
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   it's very fine and accepted to demonstrate your well show.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.240]   - Well, yeah. - Yeah, things like that.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.480]   And so there's absolutely something
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.440]   where you take out an iPhone, you put on the table,
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.360]   that means something.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.360]   And there's no surprise the Apple Watch,
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.480]   the first editorial was in Chinese Vogue.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.960]   I mean, you can't really understand Apple.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.320]   - The cover of Vogue China had,
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.560]   the model was wearing an Apple Watch.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.400]   So it's no accident then that when Apple talked
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.280]   about this hijack attempt,
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.140]   they didn't use the word China at all.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.920]   They did put out a page saying how you could use a browser
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.040]   that would detect certificate fraud and warn you.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.280]   Apparently the most used browser in China does not,
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.720]   Chi-Hoo does not, but Chrome does, Firefox does,
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.160]   and of course Safari does.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.320]   So Apple doesn't mention China.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.120]   They just say, "Just in case,
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.440]   you probably should use one of these browsers."
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.960]   - Right, I mean, Apple has improved a lot,
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.280]   they're kind of public response in China.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.480]   - They're not foolish. - They're not foolish.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.080]   - Well, there was a year ago, I think,
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   there was a Chinese in Shinwah,
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.160]   there was a report about Apple warranty problems
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.680]   and reliability or something.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.760]   And Apple was, they're typical Apple and PR,
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.840]   not really responding,
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.760]   - Yeah. - Responding kind of being like,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.080]   "Yeah, give me a break."
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.440]   And that did not go over well.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.080]   And Apple had to do quite a bit of damage control.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.680]   And now you see when these sorts of things go up in China,
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.480]   they're very fast, they're much more,
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.720]   I mean, Donnie's subservient,
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.320]   but that's almost kind of the tone
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.800]   that Western companies need to take in China.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   And it's obvious what a priority it is for them
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.080]   and from a business perspective, very understandably so.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.600]   But it's definitely something to be aware of
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.280]   as far as a risk factor for the company.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.400]   - I understand a company's fiduciary responsibility
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.120]   to make money, Apple's a publicly held company,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.160]   this is a big market.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.080]   But there is a risk going,
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.480]   there's a huge number of risks going into China.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.960]   One, that the Chinese would just steal
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.160]   your intellectual property and say,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.200]   "Thank you very much."
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.120]   That's not likely.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.840]   But that's what happened to Microsoft.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.320]   The other issue is,
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.400]   how is the rest of the world gonna react to a China,
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   or to an Apple that moves into China,
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.480]   ignores human rights issues,
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.200]   ignores how the factories are run,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.520]   and just says, "Yeah, we got a great new market.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.520]   "We don't care."
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.480]   Isn't there a risk?
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.680]   - No, they've already been dealing with that, right?
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.520]   - Apple has.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.840]   - To a degree with the Foxconn thing, right?
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   - Right. - Apple has.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.680]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.400]   - After that New York Times exposé.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.920]   - You know, but those of us here,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.880]   you know, we tacitly support that behavior in Apple
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.320]   because we--
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.160]   - You buy their products.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.320]   - They're playing about a 905.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.280]   That's it, right.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.320]   So you have a $950 iPhone 6 Plus
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.920]   if you want the, you know, the biggest one.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.040]   - And that's great.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.960]   But in order to get that price to $950,
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.360]   they need to have underpaid by our standards.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.920]   - Actually, it's underpaid workers.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.960]   - I don't know if that's the case.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.840]   I think it probably cost them $150, $200 to make.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.200]   Isn't somebody was saying Apple's price model is,
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.240]   you multiply it by three and add 50 bucks.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.160]   Isn't that right?
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.000]   Come on.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.240]   - Well, that means-- - Does it cost them $900 bucks
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.080]   to make the iPhone 6 Plus?
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.400]   - Well, yeah, the way it will cost them a lot.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.000]   - No, but the R&D either.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.560]   - R&D, all right.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.640]   Okay.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.440]   - Right, I mean, they gotta iterate on these things.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.800]   They can't develop an iPhone and then let it sit
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.960]   for six years.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.840]   They've gotta come out with a new one next year, right?
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.720]   And so I think if they did move that manufacturing
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.080]   into the US or started paying people in Foxconn US wages,
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.880]   which would be totally crazy for a lot of reasons,
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.440]   it would cause a lot of unrest, I think.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.120]   But if they chose to do that,
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.840]   it would make all of us who complain about Apple's supporting
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.760]   unfair labor practices happy.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.600]   And then we would also get to pay the price for that
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.440]   because you know that Apple's not gonna eat that cost.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.200]   They're gonna pass it along to us as every business does.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.680]   - You know, we have an interesting case here of Apple.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.920]   There's a lot of pressure on Apple to build in the US
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.040]   and to use US suppliers.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.640]   Of course, the reason they use Asian suppliers
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.840]   is 'cause that's where the good suppliers are.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.160]   And it's a very well-developed network.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.080]   And you know, everybody uses it.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.480]   Everybody's paying the same.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.760]   - It's the world's factory.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.360]   - Right, so I don't know if they were responding
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.560]   to the pressure, but they make one deal
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.200]   with a US supplier to supply sapphire
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.120]   and the whole thing blows up.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.440]   It's just a terrible, terrible relief.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.520]   Nothing went right.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.560]   The company can't deliver on the price they promised.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.000]   They go bankrupt, they sue to,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.240]   they just drag the whole thing into court.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.640]   And Apple is, you know, I'm not sure what they're doing.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.720]   They seem like they're doing everything they can
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.520]   to keep this company alive.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.600]   And then when it collapses, they're still trying to say,
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.560]   you know, trying to figure out a way
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.320]   to continue to work with them.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.000]   - I just have the feeling that none of this would have happened
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.360]   if they'd been dealing with a tie-walt tie-walt.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.280]   - Yeah, I gotta point that out.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.120]   That's right.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.320]   Philip was actually in court in New Hampshire during that.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.560]   We're gonna talk about that.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.720]   And of course, I think about the Moto Maker Plant,
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.160]   which was opened by Motorola with great fanfare.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.880]   And it was at Texas and is closed now.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.900]   They moved it out of the United States, I think to Mexico.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.920]   Apple does have one product made in the US, the Mac Pro.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.640]   I doubt very many of them are made.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.760]   But it's not just the cost.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.520]   I mean, the cost of a phone is like $4.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.680]   And it wouldn't actually be that much higher in the US
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.440]   because, you know, the agreed to which things are automated.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.360]   And reality is a lot of the manual labor is creating
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.520]   is further down the supply chain.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.040]   But it's all the suppliers in the entire,
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.920]   as Philip said, the entire ecosystem goes around it.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.760]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.840]   I mean, it's like, you know, back in the heyday
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.160]   of the US Auto Matter Effect system,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.480]   it wasn't just the auto makers in Detroit.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.120]   It was all the suppliers in Toledo and Akron
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.240]   and all these sort of places.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.080]   Like there's an entire ecosystem that goes
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.640]   into creating these things.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.280]   And that's entirely gone in the US for the most part.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.720]   And so I think-- - But it's not just,
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.080]   it's not just the ecosystem.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.680]   It's, I think, and Philip, you were kind of alluding to this.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.440]   It's expertise.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.240]   - Right, absolutely.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.280]   I mean, and the reality is wages have gone up quite a bit.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.560]   For a high-end sort of engineer,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.480]   there are gonna be actually rough, almost equivalent,
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.840]   obviously for a factor on workers,
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.920]   it's gonna be much lower.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.160]   But it's still at least double,
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.480]   if not more than it was, just a couple of years ago
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.840]   and significantly higher than it was 10 years ago.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.000]   - But as you point out, I think this is what you meant.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.320]   The labor costs on an iPhone are maybe five bucks.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.040]   - Yeah, that's not the cost of an iPhone.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.880]   - The labor cost of the iPhone.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.520]   - Right, but that's, again, that's the final assembly.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.640]   Like there's obviously labor costs for each component.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.680]   - You could triple that or quadruple it.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.920]   And it still wouldn't really add significantly
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.040]   to the bottom, to the cost of making an iPhone.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.120]   - I mean, every little bit matters
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.280]   when it comes to margin in the bottom line.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.920]   But the reality is, and I think Steve Jobs said this
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.200]   at some point about like, they're not coming back.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.720]   And the jobs are not coming back.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.680]   - Right, and what that had to do with was, again,
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   not because of cost, it was, it's because we've lost that.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.480]   We've lost the ability to compete effectively
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.720]   in these sorts of things.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.720]   And so you get a Mac Pro, you see those videos,
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.080]   it's highly automated.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.440]   There's only a few people, all the stuff's made elsewhere
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.960]   and brought in and then snapped together.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.600]   - Yeah, it's not really making jobs in the US.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.440]   I wanna take a break.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.800]   I do wanna talk about Apple Pay.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.480]   We got a lot more to talk about.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.760]   It's great to have Philip Elmer DeWitt from Fortune.com here.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.000]   I hope you don't mind.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.720]   I called you one of the senior statesmen
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.840]   of technology journalism.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.320]   - Yeah, I don't know, am I older than you or not?
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.660]   - A little bit.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.600]   (laughing)
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.440]   - Not much.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.960]   - I just went on Medicare, so that's--
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.280]   - Yeah, you mean--
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.840]   - It turned out to be one on Pornell.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.960]   And Pornell will always be older than all of us,
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.920]   so it's okay.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.240]   We always have Jerry.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.440]   We just hope, you know.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.240]   Also with us, Dave Hamilton from Mac Observer
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.160]   and the Mac Geek Gab Fest.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.120]   Did I say that right?
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.720]   - Yeah, we don't usually say it's a Fest,
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.360]   but it is a party every time we do it.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.720]   So that's a good thing.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.920]   (laughing)
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.680]   - And from time on, Ben Thompson of Stretech-Eree,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.040]   our show today brought to you by the folks at Citrix,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.080]   who do Citrix Go to Meetings.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.640]   Yeah, we're doing this.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.600]   I just love modern technology.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.640]   It's really amazing.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.720]   Here we can do a show with people all over the world.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.680]   Sit around the table and Gab,
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   of course we're using Skype,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.400]   which means it's not working very well.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.920]   See, if we were using Go to Meeting,
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.200]   it'd be working a lot better.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.480]   Maybe we have to think about that.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.120]   Go to Meeting is the way to collaborate,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.440]   to work together.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.840]   It's more than just video.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.280]   Of course they have crystal clear video
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.520]   with their HD video conferencing,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.320]   but it's also screen sharing.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.520]   That's how Go to Meeting was born.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.240]   The idea that you could share a screen
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.680]   with somebody else all over the world.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.560]   You could collaborate.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.480]   You can work together with teams distributed
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.320]   as they are today.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.680]   This is an incredible solution.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.800]   All over the world, at your desk or at your iPad,
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.960]   it works on mobile.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.760]   It works on Mac.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.640]   It works on PCs.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.520]   It saves you time.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.360]   You get more work done.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.960]   You travel less.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.920]   I love Go to Meeting.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.120]   Schedule meetings in advance.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:43.960]   It's so easy to use.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.720]   You can meet on the fly.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.280]   Just press a button.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.640]   Start a meeting.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.600]   And by the way, I know teams all over the world
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.840]   who collaborate with each other through Go to Meeting.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.800]   They just leave it running.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.640]   Go to Meeting.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.040]   It allows you to work smarter, more efficiently.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.760]   Take more control of your time and resources.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.200]   And it's free.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.080]   For the first 30 days when you visit GoToMeeting.com,
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.200]   click the Try It Free button.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.400]   Go to Meeting.com.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.440]   Click the Try It Free button.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.920]   And we thank Citrix as always so much for their huge support.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   Dave, have you purchased anything with Apple Pay?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.080]   Have you tapped your phone yet?
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.960]   You know what's funny is the first place that I used Apple Pay?
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.720]   It was Rite Aid, believe it or not.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.520]   And the last time you'll be doing that.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.600]   It was literally five minutes after I did that,
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.960]   we started getting the emails in saying,
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.040]   Rite Aid's going to cancel.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.480]   I'm like, no, it literally just worked.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.040]   And it worked perfectly.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.840]   So what is it?
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.360]   I don't know, Philip, have you used Apple Pay?
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.440]   Probably not.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.080]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.680]   I went right down to buy some toothpaste right away.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.280]   And where did you use it?
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.960]   You know, I usually go to CVS.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.720]   But because CVS wasn't part of the team,
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.560]   I went to Walgreens a little further away.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.280]   Doesn't say up in 24 hours.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.880]   Not quite as nice a store.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.120]   But it worked.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.920]   And then like Dave, I found out that, you know,
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.560]   what's the name of the thing?
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.200]   It's called Currency.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:11.720]   Currency, yeah.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   Currency.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.880]   And this is a system called MCX that actually was,
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.440]   I believe, created by Walmart.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.920]   Yup.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:25.120]   And will be adopted by Yes, Rite Aid, Yes, CVS, Wawa,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.400]   Come and Go.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.200]   Never heard of some of these places.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:33.760]   But the idea is that-- get how this works.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.280]   Apparently, Rite Aid and CVS have shut down.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.560]   They had Tap To Pay.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.960]   It wasn't even designed for Apple Pay.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.880]   It was designed to work with Android, Wall,
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.400]   and other Tap To Pay solutions.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.000]   But the NFS-- but you know, what Apple's doing is not Apple only.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.040]   It's a standard Eurocard, Mastercard Visa, EMV standard
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.160]   that is global standard.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.960]   And so because Rite Aid and CVS already supported Tap To Pay,
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.320]   I remember-- I've used it at my CVS store.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.840]   Who knew it worked fine with Apple Pay until they said,
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.680]   whoops, we don't want it to work with Apple Pay.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.080]   But they're not just shutting down Apple Pay, right?
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.640]   They're shutting it all down.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.920]   Which tells you how few people use it.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.760]   And conversely, shows you how successful Apple Pay is
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.880]   or people predict it to be despite the fact that it has been out--
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.440]   well, I mean, as of the time when they announced it,
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.920]   four days, right?
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.600]   I mean, because it basically came out Monday
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.680]   when we were able to get 8.1.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.600]   And so it's out four days.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.000]   Oh, it's been available.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.080]   Like you said, you could go and do this at Rite Aid,
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.120]   and nobody cared.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.120]   Now it's been out four days.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.520]   Only works with the iPhone 6, right?
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.200]   Both of them, but only them.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.680]   Because they're the only ones with NFC.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.440]   That's right.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.640]   And there's no watch yet.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.760]   So we can't use it with the iPhone 5 and that.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.800]   And yet, no problem until Apple pays here.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.160]   And now immediately, we've got to shut it down.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.240]   This is in violation.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.360]   And it always has been in violation of this MCX
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.760]   as the company or the consortium, I guess, that--
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.200]   Nobody used it.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.480]   There's nobody used it.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.800]   That's right.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.680]   So the way it works-- and by the way,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.520]   I've got a Google Wallet here on my Galaxy Note 4.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.400]   And it's the same thing.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.560]   You add a credit card to it.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.720]   Apple has a nice little feature where you can scan--
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.080]   people said take a picture, but you're not.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.880]   You're scanning the credit card.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.480]   It sees the number.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.160]   By the way, one of my credit cards,
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.800]   it was so little contrast it couldn't.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   But on the ones it could, it would see the number.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.680]   It would see your name.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.480]   It would see the expiration date.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.120]   And all you had to enter in was the security code.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.000]   It was so it's pretty easy to get a credit card
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.680]   into the Apple Pay Wallet.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.200]   Unfortunately, a lot of banks aren't yet supporting it.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.840]   So most of my credit cards didn't work,
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.040]   but American Express did.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.600]   One of my master cards did.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.320]   And any Apple-- any card you have registered with iTunes
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.560]   is going to work out of the box.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.760]   You just have to enter in the security code.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.640]   And then it's a pretty simple process, right?
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.920]   Dave, you go tell me how it worked when it worked.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.360]   I mean, I-- and this is the thing versus currency, right?
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.200]   But you go up, you take your phone,
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.680]   you wave it close enough.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.000]   You could tap the little unit.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.360]   You don't have to.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.360]   But you don't have to.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.080]   You get close enough.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.400]   And suddenly, the phone lights up,
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.520]   and it shows me my default card.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.120]   And I could pick another card if I wanted.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.600]   But I went and set my default card,
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.720]   and that's the one I wanted to use.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.480]   And it said, just hit your touch ID, and you're done.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:31.760]   That's key.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.360]   Real fast.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.360]   100%.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:33.560]   It's--
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.320]   Do we have Chad the video of Needles doing it?
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.280]   Yeah, let me pull it up.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.360]   Because we sent out one of our intrepid reporters,
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.880]   Jeffrey Needles, to the local whole earth
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.880]   to buy chicken fingers.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.040]   And he did it.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.080]   And so I think we have video of the process.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.760]   Now, get this.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.600]   While you're thinking how easy that was, especially
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.920]   once you've set it up, it's really-- it's just
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.440]   putting your thumb or your finger on the touch ID,
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.000]   and that's it.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.840]   There's no entry.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.920]   Here's Jeff doing it.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.000]   You don't even have to wake your phone up, right?
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.560]   Yeah, even if it's off, you just touch the touch ID.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.560]   So there-- but pause it right there real quick,
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.520]   or go back a little bit so we could see it.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.440]   Because this is the whole earth of--
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.680]   this is a verif-- what is it?
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.880]   Verifone, right?
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.160]   So it says, "Amex, Apple Pay."
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.920]   It's got that universal logo, which
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.640]   looks like a fish dinner with just the bones left.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.520]   It's got-- it looks like pay pass from MasterCard
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.600]   and Visa discovered.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.360]   All of those, if you had a pin in them, would work, right?
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.400]   So anything with NFC, you would just tap it, and it would work.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.040]   OK, go ahead.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.920]   Let's play it, because he's going to--
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.040]   he sees the Apple Pay.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   First time in the store.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   I think.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.040]   What do we do?
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   This is what do I do?
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   It pops up.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   You put your finger on it.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.520]   You don't even press.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.760]   And really, seconds later, you're done.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.320]   You've got chicken fingers.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.080]   OK, get this.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.080]   Get this.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   So get this.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.520]   And they get a little picture of pumpkins,
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.960]   because it's Whole Foods and they're earthy crunchy.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.800]   So get this.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   This is what currency-- how currency would work.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.440]   So before you can go to your Rite Aid or CVS--
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.040]   by the way, this won't work till next year anyway--
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.000]   but before you could go in your Walmart,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.720]   or your Rite Aid or your CVS, you'd
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.680]   have to download the appropriate app from the App Store
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.240]   or Google Play Store.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.080]   By the way, this won't work with all credit cards.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   Just certain debit cards and loyalty cards.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.200]   So you have no credit cards?
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.520]   No credit cards, in fact.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.040]   That's right.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.640]   Just debit cards and loyalty cards.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.720]   That was the whole point to get away from paying.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.120]   We don't want those.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.520]   We don't want to give any money to MasterCard.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.560]   So then you say you go up to the crash register.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.240]   They ring you up.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.720]   And then on the screen appears--
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.280]   it doesn't work with NFC-- a QR code.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.920]   So now you go into your phone and you find the app,
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.400]   you launch it.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:50.720]   Oh, no.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.040]   Before you go into your phone-- before you can launch the app,
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.240]   you have to wake your phone up and unlock it.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:55.720]   Oh, yes, of course.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.440]   Don't forget that step.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.960]   I mean, there's a lot of steps here.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.880]   And then you launch the app and you
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.240]   take a picture of the QR code, the phone
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.080]   chews on it and goes, OK.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.120]   And then sends it off to the Cloud for Authorization.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.400]   And then send-- I don't know how it gets back to the merchant
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.120]   now.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.520]   Does a merchant have to take a picture of a QR code on your phone?
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.960]   Your phone also needs to have a data connection.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.440]   So you turn your phone around and say, oh, I got a QR code here.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.600]   And then it goes back.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.360]   Five hours later, you've paid for your chicken fingers.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.400]   This is the first time I'm starting.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.880]   It's great to check.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.800]   It would be easier to cash check.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.480]   But the whole point of this-- and this
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.080]   is why Walmart created it-- is they get your address.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.400]   They get your phone number.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.640]   They get your purchases.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.680]   They get it all, the information.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.160]   And they give no money to MasterCard or Visa.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160]   Right.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:49.680]   Right.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.280]   But you know, here's the thing.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.920]   When I used Apple Pay at Rite Aid,
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.200]   Rite Aid, we have a wellness points account with them.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.880]   Because it's in our best interest, right?
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.120]   We're willing to share our purchase history with them.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.440]   And then we get pretty significant discounts
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.560]   off of stupid things like cough drops.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.120]   And so it's worth it.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.440]   And before I did my Apple Pay thing,
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.200]   I entered in my Rite Aid number.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   So I opted in at the point of purchase, as I do every time,
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:15.840]   to do this.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.440]   Now, if say I wanted to buy something
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.040]   that I didn't want on our thing, I could just not opt in.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.680]   And there I am, all good.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.960]   Apple Pay or not, they're not going to get my information
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.680]   if I don't do that.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.520]   So Rite Aid's already got this tracking thing.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.960]   Yeah, they still got to pay MasterCard.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.280]   They're two points or whatever it is.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.680]   But it doesn't make any sense to you.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.320]   Here's a picture.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.520]   Dan Frommer posted a picture of his.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.600]   He says, can't wait for the mobile payments app from the company
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.640]   that designed this receipt.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.280]   And this is true.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.880]   You go buy one thing at CVS.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.520]   You get a four foot long receipt from them with coupons,
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.560]   mostly for stuff you've already purchased at CVS,
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.760]   because they know.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.160]   So you say, Philip, this is a non-starter.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.480]   Well, a couple of things.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.200]   First of all, I think the killer feature about this Apple
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.640]   Pay thing is how fast the line moves.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.000]   Oh, I like that.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.640]   Yeah, because you know what it's like to wait behind people
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.520]   who are fishing in their wallet for their money,
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.920]   and then they're counting their change.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.240]   Women, for some reason, count exact change.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.480]   Men never do.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   Oh, it worked.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.800]   Pulling out their credit cards.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.960]   When you see people just stick in their phone,
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.680]   they're making the purchase and moving on,
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.080]   and everybody else gets to move that much faster.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.840]   That's really going to sell this service.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.640]   The other thing, the reason I say it's a non-starter,
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.200]   and Van Eun may know more about this than I do.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   But apparently, Alibaba used QR codes
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.720]   for their payment thing in competition with Union Pay,
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.000]   is that what it's called?
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.040]   And it turned out to be so--
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.120]   it's much simpler, but it turned out to be easily hacked.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.920]   And people were putting little Trojan horses.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:03.000]   They were redrawing, I guess, these little robot fingerprints,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.760]   and putting Trojan horses in, and stealing people's bank
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   information, and then stealing their money.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.320]   And the Chinese government in March halted it.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   They said Alibaba couldn't use QR anymore.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.680]   So, you know, here you've got Apple Pay
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.200]   with the most secure payment system we have
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.920]   that works with a tap, and everybody's going to move
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.480]   to the line faster.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.080]   And then to have to--
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.320]   the idea that all these companies are going to go
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.520]   to the back field, QR system that never really took off,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.120]   just doesn't seem like it's going to happen.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.040]   And I predict that all those two or three dozen companies
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.080]   that are on the-- that are supposedly part of this
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.360]   Walmart scheme will be trying to get out of their contracts
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.400]   as fast as they can.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.080]   Yeah, so it's a privacy invasion, it's a pain in the ass,
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.040]   and it's insecure.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.480]   What could possibly go wrong?
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.240]   No, I felt just that the key thing, though,
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.640]   is the contract.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.920]   All these folks who are signed up for the--
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.360]   the umbrella service is called MCX,
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.160]   a merchant exchange or something.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.880]   And they've all signed exclusivity agreements,
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.800]   whereas the MCX solution, the currency,
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.520]   will be the only form of the sort of payment that they'll take.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.040]   And from what I understand, I haven't seen the contract,
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.800]   but I've talked to people who have talked to people
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.560]   who have seen the contract.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.320]   There are significant penalties for breaking this.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.960]   And so it's likely that CVS--
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.440]   I think there certainly is an angle where they--
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.400]   and merchants in general-- are not happy with Apple Pay
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.880]   because they do lose identifying customer data,
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.800]   which is very valuable, and they do sell.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.720]   I mean, people who are outraged at what Facebook and Google
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   track, boy, if you ever had an idea of what is tracked
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.320]   about your day-to-day purchases would be, frankly, appalled.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.040]   It's pretty incredible.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.000]   That's a part of it, for sure.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:57.720]   But there's also some--
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.440]   I think the whole thing was designed by Google
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.040]   to make us feel better about the data that Google collects.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.400]   Well, I mean--
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.840]   I think we're bad.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.840]   You want to see these guys.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.440]   I do think that-- yeah, I tend to be more sympathetic
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.440]   to Google and Facebook on those points.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.120]   But there is this contract here where there is exclusivity
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:17.640]   contract--
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.080]   That's bad because this is a--
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.320]   just look at the list of companies that are using this--
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.280]   Bed, Bath, and Beyond, 7/11 Dunkin' Donuts.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.320]   You're saying that if they have MCX currency,
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.800]   they can't do anything else best buy.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.320]   For three years.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.000]   For three years.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.400]   The GAP, Dick's Sporting Goods.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.840]   I mean, the rally is at the contracts.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.880]   That's the contracts.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:46.200]   As GA technology just demonstrated, or GT Advanced,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   you can get out of contracts.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.280]   And I think it'll be fascinating to see the pressure that
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.400]   happens here.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.440]   To me, the big news here is kind of buried.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.720]   It's that I don't think anyone really
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.400]   realized that Apple Pay would just work.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.120]   I think there was an assumption that merchants
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.000]   would have to sign up and agree to accept Apple Pay.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.080]   But actually, it turns out, if you have the hardware,
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.840]   it will just work.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.160]   Because it's really a standard.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.280]   It's not anything Apple created at a whole clock.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:10.920]   Right, exactly.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.560]   And so you do need the banks.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.640]   But Apple has understood that they have a lot of leverage
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.240]   versus the banks because it's a little complicated.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   But I think from a merchant perspective,
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.920]   you only use a merchant occasionally.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.280]   So yes, maybe some people will avoid CVS
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.080]   and go to Walgreens.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.800]   But the reality is most people are going to go to what's
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.920]   close to them.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.960]   In the moment of decision, convenience will win.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.560]   You still have to--
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.800]   You can still use a credit card.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.760]   You can still pay with cash, both of which is wrong.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.200]   Right, exactly.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.680]   A voting comes to a bank.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.520]   If every time you can't use Apple Pay
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.920]   because your bank doesn't support it,
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.880]   now it's impacting you so frequently
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.600]   that you will go to the trouble finding a new bank.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.400]   So I think the leverage Apple has versus the banks
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.760]   is a lot different than they have versus merchants, which
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.760]   is why Apple's taking a skim off the banks, not off the merchants.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.160]   If Apple understands anything, it's leverage.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.760]   And then you combine that with an October 2015,
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.600]   merchants need to support chip and pin, or else they
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.000]   assume a lot more risk in the transactions.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.600]   If you buy a new payment terminal today,
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.440]   it almost certainly has NFC just because everything
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.000]   will have NFC these days.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.080]   And so the implications are--
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.200]   again, I have been operating the assumption that Apple would
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.000]   not just need the hardware there, but also
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.640]   need merchants to agree to take it.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.600]   That's not the case.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.000]   They just need to have the appropriate hardware in place,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.040]   and it will work unless they turn it off.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.760]   And there's been tons of research about--
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.920]   if you have so many opt-in versus opt-out,
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.200]   anything that's opt-in is going to have much lower adoption
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.400]   than anything that is opt-out.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.600]   And this is the case here.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.840]   And so at the end of the day, I think this is actually
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.640]   a great sign for Apple.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.280]   In that one, there is going to be way more merchants that
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.720]   support them, I think any of us realized.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.560]   And two, just the terrible PR bloodbath that CBS is going
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.880]   through right now is going to make a lot of merchants have
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.440]   pause about one, about turning it off for whatever reason,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.720]   because they want data or whatever.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.000]   And two, is going to put a lot of pressure on this coalition
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.600]   because CBS isn't going to be the only one that feels the pain.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.200]   People are actually calling for boycotts of Friday and CBS.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.600]   That's not--
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.640]   I mean, how much is this going to hurt those companies?
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   You use MCX.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.240]   You're not going to lose business really, are they?
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:22.760]   I mean--
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.400]   Well, they could if Apple denies the currency app
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.160]   from the app store.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.160]   Oh.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.720]   Well, no, no one's going to use the currency app.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.560]   It doesn't even matter if they do.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.840]   What you're saying, ban away.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.520]   Not in fact, nobody's going to use it anyway.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.200]   No, the competition is the credit card.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.200]   I think it's not going to hurt them per se.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.640]   There will be some people that just don't shop there.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:51.640]   What it is is I think what will move the needle is if retailers
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.720]   that use Apple payers actually seem whiffed.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.800]   I mean, Apple's consistent argument
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.520]   to these sort of companies, to music companies,
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.320]   to movie companies, to where there might be,
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.720]   is that you're giving up incremental sales
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.360]   because by making it more convenient and easier,
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.960]   people will buy more often.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.400]   And you can be sure Apple will be marshaling evidence that, oh,
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.640]   so and so you can see the keynote now in the XWWDC.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.800]   Oh, X retailer, you know, adopted Apple Pay
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.280]   and their sales went up X percent.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.920]   That's a personal point.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.600]   No, that will be the selling point.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.400]   But, Philip, you have even said it yourself.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.320]   You're not going back to that.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.440]   Walgreens, you did it once for Apple Pay,
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.760]   but CVS is easier, more complete, and nearer.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.600]   You're going to continue to come there.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.280]   Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.200]   But you know what?
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.360]   I fully expect CVS will be using Apple Pay by next year.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.720]   I think you're right too.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.600]   This will be a very short order revolution.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.000]   You know, one of the things that keeps coming up that,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.920]   I have a problem with the talking points about this,
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.320]   is that Apple is not charging merchants.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.520]   They're charging the banks, right,
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.800]   in order to use Apple Pay.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.400]   But that's normal for this type of thing, right?
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.760]   The banks get charged.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.160]   There's a cascade of how things work.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.920]   Because it makes them along the merchant
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.480]   as credit card charges.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.320]   That's it.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.040]   It's going to, you know, when you use your loyalty card, right?
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.000]   And we take credit cards here for a lot of things.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.160]   And so when you use your loyalty card,
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.120]   and you get miles or hotel points or whatever it is
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.280]   that you get, there is a cost for that.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.920]   And there is a fixed dollar cost
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.760]   for what those costs for that transaction.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.520]   And that is passed transparently,
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   all the way through to the merchant.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.360]   And then from them to us, of course.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.520]   And well, of course, let's keep it going.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.920]   Let's keep the pass through going
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.840]   because we always end up paying in the long run.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.440]   Well, you have to, right?
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.000]   I mean, profit margins being what they are.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:44.920]   It's just how it works.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.760]   So when people say the banks are paying at Apple Pay fees
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.320]   and it's not the merchants and therefore not the customers,
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.880]   that sort of rings false.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.280]   I mean, of course, the merchants are going to get it.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.760]   But hopefully with both Apple Pay and more so,
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.440]   it's not Chippin' Pin next year,
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.240]   it's Chippin' Sign here in the US for October.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.200]   But when that comes in theory,
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.840]   fraud costs go down and then in theory,
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.760]   your discount rate goes down as long as you're opting in
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.480]   as a merchant to the system and using it properly.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.280]   And so maybe this incremental cost of Apple Pay,
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.160]   which is only 15 basis points to the bank.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.560]   So it's not a huge number, but still,
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.880]   maybe your costs go down and maybe it's a wash
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.680]   and you don't really notice it in the end.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.440]   But it's certainly merchants and therefore consumers
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.880]   are going to be eating these Apple Pay fees
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.920]   in one way or another.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.120]   Your bank's not just going to say,
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.640]   "Oh yeah, out of the goodness of our heart."
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.840]   - It's still a win though, come on.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.240]   - It's still a win though.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.920]   - The issue is that the fees are the same,
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.760]   whether you use a credit card or whether you use Apple Pay
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   for the merchant.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.400]   Like you're paying 2.9% in both cases.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.000]   I mean, it varies by credit card.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.960]   So no, but the point is like,
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.960]   that's why I think it is valid to say
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.920]   that merchants aren't paying anything because they're--
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.640]   - But it used to be that way with loyalty cards.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.160]   The banks ate the fees and then they decided,
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.760]   "Wait, we're not going to do this anymore.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.680]   We're not just going to bake it
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.040]   into the discount rate, we're going to pass it through."
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:09.960]   That's how it works.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.400]   - Eventually it's going to come through.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.800]   - I mean, Apple's not a stupid company.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.600]   They're not going to sign these contracts with the banks
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.360]   and then allow the banks to pass it on.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:23.120]   Like I would strongly suspect the agreements
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.240]   are kind of a most favored nation clause
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.880]   in that the banks can't charge more
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.560]   than their standard rate for an Apple Pay transaction.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.760]   I mean, I'd be shocked it wasn't the case.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.560]   So we'll, obviously no one's going to see these contracts.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.920]   I do think it is chip and pin coming,
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.520]   but regardless, everyone's going to need
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.960]   these new sort of terminals.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.320]   So it's going to be interesting to see how--
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.480]   - Chip and pin can't come to the US yet.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.200]   It can, the terminals will support it,
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.240]   but the problem is we here in the US
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.000]   will have no way of putting a pin on our card
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.320]   because it would require revamping the ATM system,
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.280]   which is why we'll go to chip and sign first
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.800]   and then hopefully over time as ATMs
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.160]   get their hardware revamped,
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.880]   we'll be able to go to chip and pin.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.520]   But October of next year rather,
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.200]   is chip and sign here in the US.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.640]   - And by the way, it's important to note
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.040]   that the reason that Walmart created MCX
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.280]   and that these merchants are doing it
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.040]   is not so much because they want a better payment system.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.240]   They just want to screw the credit card companies.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:29.200]   Mike Dudas, Croats, former Walmart CEO, Lee Scott,
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.000]   I don't know that MCX will succeed
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.960]   and I don't care as long as Visa suffers.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.360]   That's what it's really about, let's face it.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.200]   All right, we're going to--
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.640]   - No, I mean, it's amazing.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.880]   I mean, I obviously my site is people paying
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.680]   with credit cards for the membership options
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.800]   and it's by far my biggest expense, like--
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.560]   - Will you support Apple Pay?
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:58.720]   - It's more unclear because I have digital content,
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.760]   so I think if I want to monetize,
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.560]   it needs to be through a traditional in-app purchase.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.560]   - Which I would love to support anyway.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.440]   I think that the, again, I think the volume you make up
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.200]   makes up for the fees at Apple Pay.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.840]   - It's 30% anyway, so.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.920]   - Yeah, but I have a lot of stuff to get done
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.440]   before I get an app written, so.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.840]   (laughs)
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.760]   - Take the money.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.840]   - iTunes, this is more bad news for the music industry.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.220]   Apple iTunes seeds a huge drop in music sales,
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.660]   at least 13%.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:35.400]   That is given that Apple is the number one retailer
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.100]   of music in the world, or at least in the US.
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:42.620]   That is since the start of the year, 13 to 14%.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.240]   Huge drop, global revenue from downloads,
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.620]   according to the International Federation
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.760]   of the Phonographic Industry,
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.200]   fell last year, 2.1%.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.780]   So it's accelerating.
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:57.800]   And it probably explains why Apple bought Beats,
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.560]   not good news for music sales in general,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.600]   because musicians do not make much money from Beats
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.080]   or Spotify or any of these other solutions.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.800]   - Didn't we assume that this is what was going on
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.280]   when they bought Beats?
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.600]   - Yeah.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.880]   They saw, they must have seen it coming, right?
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.040]   The rumor is, and that's not confirmed
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.200]   that Apple will rebrand the Beats product,
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.900]   which is a subscription product
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:28.260]   and folded into iTunes sometime next year.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.220]   - I'd be surprised if they don't keep the Beats name.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.420]   But--
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.260]   - You think so?
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.180]   It's such a strong brand, right?
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.660]   - Yeah, I mean, the strong brand with the demographic
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:38.700]   they're trying to reach.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:44.060]   Yeah, I mean, Apple has better numbers
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.820]   than whatever group this was,
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.540]   the International Federation of Phon--
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.900]   They saw this coming earlier, right?
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.740]   - Oh yeah.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:54.820]   - I'm sure they have a dashboard on Tim Cook's desk
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:56.520]   with a downward pointing arrow.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.280]   - I'm glad I'm not a musician, but it's a tough life.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.460]   It's a tough life anyway, even if you, you know,
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.820]   you see these guys dragging their equipment left in there
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.600]   and they don't make that much money and they--
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.380]   - Somebody just said it's karma.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.740]   The music industry has been robbing musicians for years.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.900]   It's about time they got, they lost money.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.260]   The music industry lost money.
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.140]   - I suppose, yeah.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.220]   - But the musicians aren't making any more.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:23.020]   I mean, it's not like the money's being,
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.420]   if there's just less money now.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:26.580]   - Nobody's buying music, period.
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:27.500]   - Well, right.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:30.980]   And to be fair, most musicians,
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.940]   even what we would consider from the outside world,
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.580]   fairly successful musicians,
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.140]   never really made money selling music.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:41.580]   You would if you got into a decades long career
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.620]   where you really started to control your own stuff,
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.980]   but especially with the labels involved,
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:50.140]   but your first wave of whatever your contract is,
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.620]   you didn't make any, you didn't make a penny
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:53.900]   from selling your music.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.340]   You made all of your money out there touring and, you know,
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.020]   like Phillip says, "Slepping your equipment"
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.140]   or perhaps paying people to "Slep your equipment."
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:04.900]   And yes, all those roadies get paid out of the bands funds,
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:06.900]   not the labels funds, right?
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.580]   But, you know, you're out there earning every dollar,
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.900]   you know, plan to hopefully larger and larger crowds.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:17.180]   But so the fact is the money goes away.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.660]   - Rolling Stones made money.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.540]   The legend is that they learn from the Beatles mistakes
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.140]   and got good contracts.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.380]   No, I mean, the game seems to be now to make the money
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:33.220]   from the venues, you know, to have to use the,
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:35.540]   to use the recordings as sort of loss leaders
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:39.860]   to bring people to a, you know, to gather an audience
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.380]   and then you make it from the ticket sales,
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.300]   but, you know, even that, that's tough work.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:50.140]   I mean, that's just the reality of being in an industry
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:54.500]   where the cost of production of your product is zero.
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:58.580]   I mean, it's very, it's, I mean, not to be queer,
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:01.420]   but creating a CD was always, you know,
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.780]   trivial as far as Costco,
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.140]   but there's something in super psychology
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.140]   where there's just a greater willingness to pay
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.580]   for a physical item than it is for a digital one.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.660]   And it's not, I mean, if you think about it
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.700]   from a very sort of pedantic sort of standpoint,
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.500]   there's, it's actually quite rational, I mean,
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.580]   because it really doesn't cost anything to create,
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.420]   to create that.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.620]   And I think you'll see this with more and more things.
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.340]   I mean, it's the way, this way my business works,
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.260]   it's the way any, lots of these businesses work,
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.420]   where you offer a product for free
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:30.220]   and you get, and you get some small percentage of that
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:32.380]   that will pay for additional content,
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.940]   will pay for t-shirts, will pay for concert tickets,
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:38.460]   will pay for the, the vinyl boxed version.
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:42.420]   That's, that's cost $100 and has extra photos and collectibles
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.180]   and all these sorts of things in it.
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:47.660]   And, you know, it's, it's in some ways,
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.940]   I think a return to the way music really was.
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.420]   Almost the last 50 years of, of the money that was made
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.620]   in music or in newspapers or in lots of other
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.180]   these sorts of industries have been disrupted
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.900]   is almost an accident of history.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.140]   - I kind of agree with you on that.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:03.460]   The platinum record era was a blip.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.180]   Although I just spent a lot of money
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.500]   to get tickets to see Fleetwood,
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.500]   Mac, I mean, there's still money in concert.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.500]   - But tickets, because you're buying it.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.500]   - It's experience.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.420]   - We're gonna take a break, well we've got a great panel.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.300]   Some of the smartest people in the Biz Dave Hamilton
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.580]   is here from the Mac Observer from Stratecary.
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:23.540]   That's the name of the blog, stratecary.com.
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:28.100]   Go there, buy it, give this man money, Ben Thompson.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.260]   - Yeah, it would be clear though,
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.260]   the blog itself is free, so.
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:32.340]   - It's free to read, but then you could subscribe
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:34.540]   to the real insights.
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:35.380]   - Something like that.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.460]   - Good stuff, isn't it?
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.580]   Actually, you know, I'm not a subscriber,
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.620]   I should subscribe, 'cause I love the blog.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.980]   Your insights are amazing.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:45.980]   Also here, Philip Elmer DeWitt from Fortune.com,
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.100]   and this is a lot of fun.
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:49.140]   We're gonna talk more in just a second.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.260]   Philip was in the courtroom this week
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.320]   when Apple and GT Sapphire perhaps made a deal.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.060]   We'll talk about that,
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.540]   but first a word from Squarespace,
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:59.700]   the place to host your next website,
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.260]   not only the best hosting in the world,
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.820]   but the best content management system,
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.060]   the software and the hardware,
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.740]   they all go together to give you an incredible experience,
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:12.060]   squarespace.com.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.500]   They're constantly improving the platform,
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.180]   and Squarespace 7, I think, just launched.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.500]   And you know what, you need this because the web,
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.220]   the standards, the way the web looks,
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.780]   the way the web works is changing so rapidly,
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.020]   you don't wanna have to think about that or deal with it,
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.260]   and Squarespace takes care of that for you.
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.260]   You'll start with one of 25 gorgeous templates,
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.220]   every one of them mobile responsive,
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.820]   so they look great at any size screen.
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.340]   They all have e-commerce.
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:42.100]   They're all state of the art CSS,
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.060]   and it's just beautiful.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.620]   Now if you're a developer, you can get in there
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.260]   and they've got a wonderful developer platform.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.580]   That's the logo designer, which is really great too.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:51.700]   But they also don't,
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.540]   you don't need to be an expert in anything.
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.180]   You just need to be an expert in your content,
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.940]   your product, and put it up on the Squarespace site.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.900]   So easy to use, but if you want help,
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.780]   they have live chat and email support 24/7,
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.340]   and they're newly redesigned Help site
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.740]   for easier access to self-help articles,
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:10.580]   and video workshops is just awesome.
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:14.180]   They start as little as $8 a month,
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.620]   and that includes the free domain name
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.980]   when you sign up for a year.
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:20.100]   They've got free apps like the Squarespace metric app
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.500]   for iPhone and iPad.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.820]   Let's you check your site stats like page views
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.380]   and unique visitors and even social media followers.
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.660]   You could post with the blog app,
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:31.660]   make text updates, tap and drag images
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.860]   to change layouts on your iPad or your iPhone.
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.420]   Monitor comments on the go.
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:42.060]   Gorgeous code, great hosting, never down.
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:43.900]   Nobody can bring it down either.
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.900]   I just love it, and I want you to try it.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.140]   This is the best part.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.940]   This is how confident they are.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.660]   Just go there and press the get started button.
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:51.580]   You've got two weeks free.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:53.220]   You don't need to give them a credit card or anything.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.180]   Just start building that website.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.740]   You can even import your data from your existing blog.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.860]   When you do decide to sign up for Squarespace,
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:02.700]   all I ask is you to use our offer code,
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:07.540]   TWIT, TWIT, we'll get you 10% off on your new account,
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.820]   and you'll be showing your support for this week in tech.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.020]   Thank you so much, Squarespace.com.
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:15.300]   Don't forget the offer code is TWIT.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:20.860]   So I don't know if, Phillip, you think this reflects
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:24.260]   on the American tech industry, or it reflects on Sapphire,
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.740]   or it reflects on Apple.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:30.340]   GT Advanced was offered almost $500 billion
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:34.900]   by Apple alone to build Sapphire furnaces.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:41.300]   For some reason, this Sapphire supply was never used.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:45.020]   People thought Apple might use it on the iPhone 6 Plus.
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:49.340]   Shortly after the iPhone was announced,
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:54.020]   GT went bankrupt, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization,
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:56.620]   because Apple apparently hadn't used its Sapphire,
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.060]   and they owed them a lot of money
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:02.100]   on the Sapphire Manufacturing Plant in Arizona.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.740]   During the back and forth,
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.940]   some information was revealed about the contracts
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:10.060]   Apple had required of GT,
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.900]   including a non-disclosure clause
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:16.340]   that had a $50 million penalty
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:20.620]   for leaking any information about their relationship with Apple.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:25.380]   $50 million on Monday, apparently,
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.980]   they reached an agreement,
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.160]   agreement not yet approved by the court,
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.900]   that GT would sell the Sapphire furnaces
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.260]   and whatever they got, however little,
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.220]   they would give to Apple,
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:40.260]   and that would satisfy their debt to Apple,
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.140]   which was hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.780]   You were in the courtroom.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.380]   The judge still needs to approve this, right?
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.100]   - Right, and he's a tough judge.
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.220]   He was very skeptical,
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.020]   and he basically warned Apple the week before
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.820]   that he'd looked at these documents
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:56.660]   that they're trying to keep secret,
[00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:57.620]   and he didn't see,
[00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.460]   he was having trouble finding anything
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:03.700]   that justified the kind of security raptor
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.900]   trying to put around it.
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.860]   I think there's a lot of things going on here.
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:12.860]   I think the $50 million per violation of an NDA agreement,
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.460]   maybe the most interesting piece of news to come out of it.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:19.140]   We all knew that Apple had some magic way
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.660]   of keeping secrets.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.500]   - How we know.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.580]   - Is that magic at all?
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:26.780]   It's $50 million per violation.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.380]   And GT, here's the thing,
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.220]   when you file for bankruptcy,
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.220]   you're supposed to tell the people
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.300]   who you're not gonna pay,
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.100]   and to whom you owe money,
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.780]   and you're not gonna pay it back,
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.420]   and the employees that you're gonna lay off,
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.220]   you're supposed to tell them what went wrong.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.500]   It's part of the deal with bankruptcy.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.500]   And GT does a lot of things.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.860]   It makes furnaces,
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.620]   what it was doing for Apple was something different.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.180]   It was actually gonna make Sapphire.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.380]   It was gonna go,
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.820]   it was not just in the,
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.060]   don't just make the furnaces,
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.340]   but actually make the Sapphire.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.700]   - Had it not made Sapphire before?
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:07.140]   - No, it's business was to sell furnaces
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.380]   to people who made Sapphire.
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:09.420]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.860]   - Yeah, so was it really a change
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.740]   of their business practice?
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.900]   And it turned out,
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.780]   they weren't as good at making Sapphire
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.500]   as they were at making the furnaces.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.860]   - When we don't know what happened,
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.580]   there were rumors that the yield rate was,
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.740]   once the Sapphire got to the assemblies in China
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.780]   that the yield rate was 25%,
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.780]   and that might be why Apple killed it,
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.580]   maybe it added significantly to the cost,
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.180]   we don't really know what happened.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.220]   - No, we don't.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:41.820]   If you, they finally did file the agreement
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.620]   with a lot of things exed out,
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:46.500]   mostly what was exed out was the amount,
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.540]   the quantity of Sapphire and the prices.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.660]   And you have to think that it was a matter of money,
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:55.180]   that they couldn't deliver the Sapphire of the quality
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:57.100]   they needed at the price they needed,
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:01.500]   and it made it uneconomical to put Sapphire on the iPhone.
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.340]   So that's the assumption.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:08.340]   And that, but, so we have these documents,
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:13.220]   the main one is something called the squirre declaration.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.380]   - This is the CO.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:18.620]   - This sounds like a novel by one of those,
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:21.540]   like a Grisham novel, the squirre declaration.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.740]   - Well, the squirre declaration is an affidavit
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:28.140]   by the COO of GT Advanced Technologies,
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:32.300]   who was, presumably knows what happened and what went wrong.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.740]   He gave this affidavit and laid it out,
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:36.980]   and Apple has been trying,
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.820]   for instance, to keep that secret, to keep it sealed up.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.660]   - So there's a smoke,
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.060]   there must be a smoking gun in there,
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.780]   although it sounds like the judge doesn't think so.
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:50.420]   - Yeah, well, the judge may not be sensitive to the kinds
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.900]   of things that Apple thinks it needs to keep secret
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.300]   for competitive reasons.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:03:00.500]   - Things like how many phones or how many watches,
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.660]   'cause some of these watches are supposed to have Sapphire.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.020]   - Well, there's a lot of people
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.260]   who would like to know what the story is,
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.220]   not the Lisa, which is the Wall Street Journal,
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.300]   which got thrown out of the courtroom
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.780]   when the squirre declaration came up
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:17.500]   for discussion, and Dow Jones has a lawyer there every day,
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.700]   saying, "Wait a minute, wait a minute,
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.900]   "we have a right to know what the story is,
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.340]   "and they're gonna continue to fight for it."
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.100]   And the state of New Hampshire,
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.740]   this is the largest bankruptcy in the state of New Hampshire,
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.140]   and the state itself, the assistant attorney general
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.940]   is there every day saying, "Wait a minute, wait a minute,
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.380]   "we wanna know why these jobs are being lost."
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.020]   - But they're being lost not in New Hampshire,
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.500]   but in Arizona and Massachusetts, right?
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:48.540]   650 employees at the Mesa plant in Arizona,
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.140]   some jobs cut in Salem, where the--
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.820]   - In Salem, Massachusetts, where you are.
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.180]   - But I guess it's a company doing business
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.060]   in the state of New Hampshire.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.580]   - It's a Manchester company, so that's where they care.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.420]   Anyway, well, I spoke to a lawyer
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:07.940]   who knows about this stuff over the end of the week,
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:12.940]   and she was saying that we won't know
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:19.420]   till we have a hearing where the judge actually says,
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.780]   he actually says what his reaction is, whether he buys it,
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.020]   whether the stuff that they delivered,
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:29.300]   the redacted agreements, and the,
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:32.780]   I don't think they've released any of the squiller decoration.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:36.580]   I mean, whether he's, whether enough has been revealed
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:40.460]   about what went wrong for him to approve the steal.
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.940]   I think they've made a strong case
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.820]   that it's probably the best thing for GT.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.100]   They go back to the business of making furnaces.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.380]   It's probably the best thing for Apple.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.060]   They're gonna get some of their money back.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:55.620]   They're actually a buyer of these furnaces.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:01.380]   They want, they may be bidding on these things.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:04.300]   There's a lot of language in the agreement about
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.340]   how much Apple would have to pay,
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:10.340]   or what the deal is if Apple turns out to be
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:14.060]   the company that ends up with these furnaces.
[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:17.340]   So anyway, it's a complicated mess.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:20.780]   And one of the virtues of moving from New York
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:22.740]   to up to Western Massachusetts,
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.540]   that it turns out that the courtroom
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.340]   where this is happening is in Springfield,
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.860]   and it's a 40-minute drive for me.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.100]   So I get to have some fun as a reporter.
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.380]   - You in the Dow Jones News Service.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.100]   - Right, those poor guys, they drove all the way
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.740]   from New York to first day to find out
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.180]   that it has all been postponed.
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.020]   - I don't feel bad.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.620]   They're getting $450 an hour plus travel fees.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.540]   - The lawyers.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.940]   - Is that all?
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.420]   Yeah, more than that.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.260]   More than that, sorry, pardon me.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:51.700]   - There were 36 lawyers in the room,
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.460]   all inexpensive suits.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:54.780]   - Oh my God.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.260]   - That bankruptcy is not fun,
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.500]   and it's costing somebody a fortune.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.340]   - None of this.
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:05.540]   - There's a lot that really stinks here, in my opinion.
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:10.380]   I mean, the GT Advanced has, in their filing,
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.140]   they have more assets than liabilities.
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.980]   So what they had was a liquidity issue
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.700]   where basically they didn't have enough money
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.140]   to, they didn't have enough free cash to pay their bills,
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.420]   even though technically they still had
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.260]   more assets than liabilities.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:27.700]   And that's usually due to a management error
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.180]   when it comes to keeping what's called working capital.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.420]   Like you should always have enough cash on the hand
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.780]   to pay your debts.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:36.780]   And there's a lot of, I mean, a lot of people,
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.260]   I think just reading around like,
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.380]   were thought that the contract,
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.660]   the deal in general, the Apple wasn't a great deal.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.180]   And it was that supposedly some companies turned it down
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.140]   before GT Advanced agreed to do it.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.540]   And meanwhile, their stock took off like a rocket.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.540]   And oh, by the way, their CEO has sold $10 million
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.380]   worth of stock in the last year.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.100]   - The day before.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.980]   - It was huge. - It was huge.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:01.380]   - Yeah, it was like $700,000.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.900]   But over the past year, he sold as an infinite amount
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.460]   when the year prior he hadn't sold any.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.180]   And now it almost, I mean, again,
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.220]   there's all these details that no one knows.
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:14.500]   I think, you know, Phillips being much more careful
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.340]   about it than I am.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:20.260]   But I mean, it kind of regards what happens,
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.220]   the CEO and several other executives have profited handsomely.
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:25.980]   And they're out of this contract
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.260]   that they suddenly decided was onerous
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.940]   that wasn't onerous a year ago.
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.380]   - And Apple has taken probably pennies on the dollar
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:33.380]   for what they had. - Well, not just that,
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.540]   but they're out of the contract for a management error,
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:39.220]   which I mean, was that an accident?
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:43.220]   Like how does this happen that you make this mistake
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:45.940]   when it was presumably, you knew it was coming for a while.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.340]   There's a lot that stinks here.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:51.220]   And I suspect that this is going to drag out for a while,
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.340]   whether it be through this hearing,
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.940]   whether it be through shareholder lawsuits
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.260]   or whether it be through all kinds of stuff.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.540]   Because the reality is, is there's a lot of people
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.900]   that are out of a lot of money
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.620]   and there's no better way to generate lots of activity
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.540]   around finding the truth
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.140]   than when there's a couple billion dollars at stake.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.940]   - So $450 an hour, that's not enough.
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:13.020]   What are these lawyers getting an hour?
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.380]   - $1,200 an hour. - What?
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.220]   - Oh yeah.
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.860]   These guys are New York lawyers.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:20.220]   - I have their Texas lawyers.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.820]   - $1,200 an hour. - I've seen your guys.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.540]   - And there's 36 of them in a room.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.340]   - Well, there might be some there at 450.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:28.180]   - (laughs)
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.020]   - I think the new guy.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.020]   Seriously.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.860]   I know it's crazy.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.100]   - But it's true.
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:33.940]   - Yeah.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:38.060]   - It's like $50,000 an hour just sitting in that courtroom.
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:41.500]   - Yeah, probably close to 15 to 20 realistically.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:43.180]   - Yeah.
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:47.820]   - And they spent a good eight hours waiting for Apple
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:49.700]   and GT to cut this deal.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.060]   - It's cool in their heels.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.180]   - We were just sitting there the whole time.
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.900]   There is a class action lawsuit against GT.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.940]   That's just been filed according to,
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.500]   or actually was filed earlier this week
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.500]   on behalf of shareholders.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.300]   So the shareholders want to know
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.300]   the hundreds of people in Mesa, Arizona
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.340]   who are out of work want to know.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.660]   Everybody wants to know.
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.780]   - Well, and there were four Asians, four Chinese,
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:14.300]   some of them I've been Taiwanese.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.140]   I'm not sure.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.060]   Well, maybe there were Japanese anyway, four Asians.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.300]   Their company had supplied compressors,
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:25.340]   2,000 compressors that were somehow involved
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.580]   in creating the sapphire.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.140]   I don't know how many millions they're owed,
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.020]   but they said, I felt so sorry for them
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.420]   'cause they heard it's all happening in English.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.660]   They could barely, you know,
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.500]   they're on the line for millions of dollars
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.700]   and they can barely follow what's going on.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.340]   It's poor guys.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:42.180]   - Somebody in the chat room.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.420]   - In the emails I get, I'm not about,
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.260]   but yeah, the emails I get are not,
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.780]   what's gonna happen to these poor workers?
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.340]   The emails we get are,
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.740]   does this mean the Apple watches delayed?
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:52.580]   - Oh, come on.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:55.300]   - That's, really, is anybody really worried
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.580]   about whether the Apple watch ships in January or February?
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:01.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.900]   - It's really easy to up demand.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:07.580]   I'm dying to get my hands on a $5,000 Apple watch.
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.580]   I can't believe it.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.180]   - You're playing the other side.
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.820]   You know that there's a huge demand.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:14.300]   I mean, look at people lined up,
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:18.820]   people lined up before the Apple event at the Apple store.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.980]   But that was for a known commodity that everybody needs.
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.060]   Everybody needs a smartphone.
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.420]   And that was a known commodity.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.340]   It was an iPhone.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.420]   - 10 years ago, we needed smartphones, Theo?
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.700]   - No, but that's not, but that's 10 years ago.
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:30.540]   - I know.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.380]   - Now it's true. - Now we need smartphones.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.460]   Do we really need Apple watches? Really?
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:38.100]   - Well, people wind up for the first iPhone.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.540]   - Chinese New Year's coming up
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.340]   and I think it's gonna be a big deal.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.620]   - You'll think it'd be on Chinese New Year.
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:44.060]   The Apple watch will,
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.780]   - I, well Ben, wasn't that your speculation
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.060]   that that's what the timing's about?
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.140]   - Well, I think that they would prefer to have had it
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:53.140]   this holiday, but I think obviously.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.180]   - So then what's the next holiday?
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.740]   - Well, the Chinese New Year's February 19th.
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.420]   - Oh, so he's right next to Valentine's Day.
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.900]   It's perfect.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.740]   - Quite late this year.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.060]   Yeah, and I don't think that'll be the way,
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.500]   I get a little bit of research about this.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.500]   And apparently there was actually a little bit of,
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.300]   the last numbers I could find were about 2012.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.660]   There was a little bit of a glut
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.780]   in Sapphire production actually.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:18.580]   Which to me suggests that the plant,
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:21.420]   there's lots of speculation about whether this plant,
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.860]   whether the iPhone 6 was ever going to have Sapphire.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:29.540]   To me, this bankruptcy and the fact that they even did it
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.140]   suggests that they did want to do Sapphire on the phone,
[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:34.980]   which would require a tremendous increase in capacity.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.860]   - There's plenty for watches.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.060]   - Yeah, well, it's not even all the watches.
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.500]   The low end, the sport watch, the $350 one,
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.940]   will not have Sapphire.
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.260]   So it's only the more expensive watches.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:49.660]   And the surface area isn't that great.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.980]   And the yields are going to be better
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:54.500]   because it's smaller physically.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.260]   So I don't suspect this really having any impact
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:00.260]   on the watch on its timing at all.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:01.820]   - You think you'll be ready mid February?
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.900]   Really, you think that's when we'll see the Apple watch?
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:06.220]   It actually is good timing for the,
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:09.060]   probably like to have it in the quarterly results.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.780]   - For Q1.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.420]   Well, I don't know if that's gonna,
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:13.380]   I don't think anyone really knows
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.980]   how much of an impact it's gonna have on the results.
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:17.860]   I mean, Apple is the iPhone company
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:18.980]   and will be for the first time.
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.180]   - We know Apple can make and break a business.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.060]   I remember from the Steve Jobs biography
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.700]   that when the iPhone first came out,
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.220]   they wanted a hard material for the surface.
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.100]   Corning had developed Gorilla Glass
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.500]   but had shuttered the plant
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.460]   'cause there was no market for it.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.460]   Jobs found them and said,
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.620]   "Can you reopen that plant?
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:40.300]   "We think we could use this Gorilla Glass you've invented."
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:41.140]   And of course, it's now,
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.980]   I'm sure it's a huge profit center for Corning.
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:45.060]   - Oh, it's massive.
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.260]   - It's not just Apple,
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.540]   they make the glass for everyone.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.380]   - Yeah.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:53.100]   - In fact, Apple never says that it has Gorilla Glass, does it?
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:53.940]   - No.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.340]   - Now, the original,
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:00.220]   the low end iPhone of the original iPhone
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.780]   was supposed to have a plastic screen, not a glass screen.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.860]   - And Jobs saw it all scratched up and said, "Whoa, whoo, whoo."
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.900]   Shortly, as I remember shortly before launch,
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.340]   I mean, like a month or two before launch,
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.540]   they said, "We need a better material."
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.580]   - Yeah, they said we upgraded it, right?
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.940]   That was their marketing, which was genius.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.540]   We've upgraded a product that you have--
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.860]   - Which you don't have yet.
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.020]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.100]   But I wonder if we'll see the same thing with the sport version.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.300]   Now, Sapphire's not cheap,
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:29.180]   but the sport watch to me seems like the one
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:32.020]   that you would want Sapphire in more than any other
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.540]   if you're using it while you're bouncing around
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.060]   and doing other things.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:35.900]   - Yeah.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.140]   - So the minimum price we know,
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.380]   'cause Apple announced it is $350.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.780]   And that's, is that the sport watch?
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.620]   - Yeah, right.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:45.140]   - With the plastic band and kinda crappy lookin'
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:47.700]   and the one, the one that they could say it's $350,
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:48.900]   but nobody wants.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.700]   And then the next--
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.140]   - I suppose we're the biggest seller.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.540]   - You think, well, yeah, 'cause who's gonna spend
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.860]   more than 350 bucks on such a speculative product?
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:00.100]   - Well, and here's the, we've got these gold one
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.220]   at the top end, right? - You'd be surprised.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.700]   - Which is gonna be like five, I mean, most people agree
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:08.100]   if it really is 24 karat gold, it's gonna $6,000.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.980]   If it's 6,000 bucks, I'll buy everyone that I can
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.140]   and sell it for the gold.
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.820]   And there is not a single gold.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.860]   Seriously, look around at watches.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.500]   There's not a gold watch on the market
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.500]   for less than 10 grand, it most people are in the $20,000
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.340]   range. - Yeah.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.180]   - Whoa!
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.140]   - Yeah, you want like a two-tone watch,
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:26.420]   then maybe you can get into the, you know,
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:29.060]   four to eight grand range, right?
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.660]   But if you've got real gold in that thing,
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:33.020]   which is, no?
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:33.860]   No?
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.500]   And here's the thing,
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.940]   if I buy a gold Rolex today, let's say, right?
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.500]   And I spend $25,000 on it. - Right.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:44.540]   - In five years, I can sell it for that same 25,000 used.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.540]   And in 10 years, I can sell it for 30.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.380]   - Right.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:48.220]   - Okay.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:51.700]   Now, I buy a, let's say the gold Apple watch is five grand
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.460]   and there's no way it's gonna, I'll eat these words
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.100]   and it'll be a great meal of crow
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.500]   'cause I'll have a gold Apple watch on while I do it.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.500]   (laughing)
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.580]   But let's say it's five grand, which it's not gonna be.
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.820]   Now, two years from that day, even two years from now,
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.140]   and it's six, let's say it's three months from being released,
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:11.620]   two years from now, that watch is obsolete.
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.260]   The tech is old. - It's worthless.
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.740]   - Worthless. - Although I do have to point out
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:19.420]   that the Ford Museum just bought the Apple one
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.420]   for $900,000, one of the Apple ones for $900,000.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.620]   So if you hold it long enough,
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.460]   (laughing)
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:26.380]   it could be worth something.
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.300]   - No, seriously.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.060]   I don't think they're gonna make very many of them.
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:31.340]   I don't think they're looking to cut into Rolex.
[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:34.060]   - So it's that middle one.
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:35.780]   Not the edition. - So it's not the one.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.700]   - What's the name of the one in the middle?
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.620]   - It's just the Apple watch. - Apple watch.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.700]   No name.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.660]   - So I think there's a few things going on here.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:47.660]   First off, I know John Gerber and I were on a podcast
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:50.220]   and kind of speculating that what if,
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:54.020]   which would be shocking that the S1,
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.260]   which is this kind of resin,
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.940]   it's already this entire system in a chip,
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.020]   worth that could be upgraded.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.500]   That would be, that would kind of change
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:03.380]   the entire conversation. - It swaps the inside out.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:06.820]   - Yeah, but two, what I've heard kind of through
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:11.540]   the grapevine is there's a strong suspicion at a minimum.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:16.460]   You will be able to trade it in the gold one anyway.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.300]   Who knows?
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:18.140]   This is a pure speculation.
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.260]   But three, again, coming back to the Chinese market,
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:24.500]   in particular, there are definitely people
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.540]   that will buy a gold apple watch
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.340]   because they can buy a gold apple watch.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:32.380]   And because it will have, you will wear that,
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.220]   and it'll have a lot of status attached to it.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:38.660]   It will be a very, a sort of thing where it's valuable
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.340]   because it's expensive.
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:44.700]   Again, I suspect there's apples gonna have some sort
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:49.700]   of program to deal with the obsolescence.
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:54.060]   But no, I agree it's gonna be several grand,
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:57.300]   probably five grand or above.
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.300]   And no, they're not gonna sell a ton of them.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:02.220]   But at the same time, they're probably gonna sell
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.300]   more than most people suspect.
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.460]   It's, I apologize, it's 18-care, not 24-care.
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.980]   Bad, 24-care would be too soft.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:11.620]   All gold and watches is 18-care.
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:12.460]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:15.500]   Five grand would be incredibly disruptive
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.580]   in the gold watch market.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.500]   (laughs)
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.660]   Yes.
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:20.500]   Seriously.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.180]   Yeah?
[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.580]   I'm in the wrong business.
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.580]   That'd be very sweet.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:26.580]   Oh, you totally.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.900]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.540]   Maybe a gold watch manufacturing lawyer.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.740]   Exactly.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:35.220]   Now I know why they have to charge $1,200 an hour.
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.140]   They gotta buy gold watches.
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.580]   They gotta buy gold watches.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:44.220]   So it says early 2015, I guess early to a normal person
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.700]   would be in the first few months, right?
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.540]   Early for Apple.
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.140]   Could be negotiated as any time before July 1st.
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.300]   (laughs)
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.220]   That would be usually means for Apple.
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.060]   Exactly.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.660]   I get it out to June.
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:56.940]   Okay.
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.460]   Yeah, 'cause we haven't even seen a prototype.
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.860]   The Apple watches, they were showing off,
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.140]   we're running a demo.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:05.100]   We don't know what was--
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:05.940]   Some of them were.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:06.820]   Could have been anything.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.380]   Well, Tim Cook's wearing one, I presume his works.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.220]   But who knows?
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:15.100]   The one they put on us was a demo running a loop
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:16.540]   and it was non-interactive.
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:19.420]   But the one that the employees were wearing,
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:20.940]   you could touch it and--
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:21.780]   Oh, two things.
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.140]   Obviously there was a, yeah.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:23.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.300]   Now I'm sure there was a limited path you could walk
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.980]   and they knew this path, which stands to reason.
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.700]   They didn't let you touch it, they touched it.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:34.260]   I got to, I did not get to wear the one that was incorrect.
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:35.100]   Did you guys touch it?
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.580]   I did get to touch it, yes.
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:38.340]   At time.
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.820]   Of course the button, did you push the button?
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:40.980]   I did.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:41.820]   Yes.
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.860]   And then all these security guards descended on me.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.220]   Was it good touch or bad?
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.020]   (laughs)
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.020]   You know, the bruise is amazing.
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.700]   It was the haptic thing was interesting
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.340]   'cause that was on my wrist, right?
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:55.340]   And I'm what, but really he put it on my wrist
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.540]   and it's important to say he put it on my wrist, right?
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:18:59.500]   I didn't put it on it.
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.020]   I think it's 'cause they wanted it tight enough
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.740]   for that tap engine to work.
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:03.940]   Interesting, yeah.
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:04.780]   Right.
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.620]   Which kind of band did it have?
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.460]   Did it have that beautiful shimmery metal band?
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.980]   That's the one I want.
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:11.940]   I tried the shimmery metal.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:12.940]   I tried a lot of them.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.780]   Of course.
[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:14.620]   Why not?
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:15.460]   You're right, you're there.
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.300]   You're there.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.140]   Look at that.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:18.780]   I wasn't paying attention to his
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:20.460]   'cause that was the one that was interactive.
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:22.900]   But I knew at some point I would feel these taps
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.260]   and two or three minutes in him.
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.980]   Like this is a four minute demo that loops on the watch.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:29.180]   You said, "How come I haven't felt it yet?"
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:32.180]   It was because I was waiting for a cell phone style buzz.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.180]   Oh, it's not that big a buzz.
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:35.300]   It's not a buzz.
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.580]   It literally feels like someone is tapping you
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:38.420]   with two fingers.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.460]   That's too creepy.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.300]   But it's nice.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:43.380]   It's not jarring like a buzz is.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:46.140]   So it's like, oh, it's a good touch.
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:46.980]   It's good touch.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.660]   Are you gonna buy one, Dave?
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:49.580]   Obviously.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.620]   He's gonna buy the gold one.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.620]   I will buy one.
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:54.460]   Here's the thing.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:55.460]   I'm a watch guy, right?
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:56.300]   Are you?
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.700]   I love watches.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.740]   So I own more than I should.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:03.340]   But I don't, I will buy one of these
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.420]   because this is my job.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:09.220]   But in order for the Apple Watch to work,
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.220]   I think it's gonna need to be your daily driver.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.020]   It needs to be the one you wear 90% of the time
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.340]   in order for it to do all the things
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:16.420]   that it's gonna do for you,
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.620]   at least from a tracking and fitness thing.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.220]   But see, as a watch buff,
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:22.420]   you wear a different watch every day, I betcha.
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:25.260]   I don't wanna give up on all my other watches.
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.100]   Right?
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.140]   So yeah, Apple has a weird thing
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:28.580]   'cause they either need to convince,
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:31.820]   watch guys like us to give up on everything else
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:33.100]   and only wear the Apple Watch.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.260]   That's one segment of the possible market.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.020]   Oh, and we have to have an iPhone five or later already.
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:38.860]   Right?
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:40.380]   Or they need to convince people
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:43.300]   that don't wear a watch to now start wearing one.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.500]   It's an interesting little twist
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:45.340]   that they've got going on.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.140]   I feel bad for Pebble.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:48.780]   I feel like they're kind of,
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.500]   the pioneers in the business and gosh,
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.220]   they just, for Android Wear is all,
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.100]   I mean, by the way,
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:58.140]   I've been wearing a Moto 360 now for probably a month or two.
[01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:58.980]   And I don't...
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.140]   Do you wear it all the time?
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.860]   I like it, yeah.
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.060]   It's awesome. Yeah.
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:04.740]   And I actually, it's actually useful.
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:07.660]   You know what's great for his nav as you're walking?
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.780]   It buzzes and when you have to turn and you look down
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:10.660]   and you say, "Oh, turn left."
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.020]   And it's really great for that.
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.140]   That's the right interface for that.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:15.980]   It's perfect.
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.780]   And even while you're driving, you can look at it.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:21.140]   The Ben has an elaborate theory
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:25.620]   that the real watch isn't going to come out
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.020]   until it's, till they can afford to put...
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:32.820]   And until it carries a sim.
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:37.540]   'Cause then it could have connectivity.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:38.380]   Right.
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:42.620]   Well, does, already Samsung makes a watch.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:46.900]   It looks a little bit like a molded iPhone on your wrist,
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.700]   but it already makes a watch with connectivity, right, Ben?
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.500]   Yeah, it's feasible.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.100]   It's big. It looks ridiculous.
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.500]   It's huge and the battery life is atrocious.
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:01.780]   But no, to me, that's the end game here.
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:04.700]   I mean, I think connectivity will flow to
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.580]   and the kind of key thing here is this will flow to
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:10.740]   the smallest, most personal item that's always with you.
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.940]   And I think actually in five years or so,
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:16.380]   we will actually have large phones,
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:19.700]   well, iPhone Plus's or Android equivalent.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.900]   Isn't that funny? We're moving in that direction?
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.740]   Well, no, exactly.
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:26.020]   'Cause it's better for everything except for portability.
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:26.860]   Right.
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:32.180]   And which leaves a great opening for a thing on your wrist.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.780]   And so we'll actually use our phones less.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.620]   The problem now is because what's on our wrist
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:37.980]   can't stand alone.
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.940]   But to me, that's okay.
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.780]   It's okay because everyone is already
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:44.020]   carrying a phone with them.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.300]   So it's not like making your life
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:46.740]   any more difficult to wear a watch.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.460]   It's more additive.
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:50.460]   But then a few years down the line,
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.540]   and so you have the watch in the market,
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.820]   your developer's building for it,
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.340]   you have it getting better,
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.940]   just like the iPhone got better.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:58.460]   It's like Android got better.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:02.780]   And then in a couple of years when technology has improved
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:03.900]   to the point or battery technology,
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.260]   particularly it's improved to the point where it's viable
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:10.220]   to have a standalone watch,
[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:12.180]   you'll happen to have the entire ecosystem there.
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:14.100]   You'll have the UI out worked out
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:17.140]   and you'll end up, I think, leaving your iPhone
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.260]   in your bag or sitting home a little more often
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.460]   than you did today.
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.340]   I hope that's true.
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.140]   I'm ready for that.
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:25.820]   I'm a little skeptical of it and I'd like to see it.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:26.740]   But I hope that's true.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.300]   Well, it's easy to be skeptical of that we would carry
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:32.260]   it in our pocket 15 years ago.
[01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:33.260]   True.
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.820]   I think it's just the course of technology.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.100]   Actually, you know what?
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:38.100]   It's not true.
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:42.580]   This is a logical, the smartphone is a logical kind of
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:45.180]   procession from a computer and it doesn't,
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:50.260]   you know, you know, if you'd seen a Newton 15 years ago,
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:52.420]   it's just made sense.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:54.540]   I think a watch is a bigger leap.
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:58.580]   Well, I think that's a different, that's an absolute.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:01.420]   Smart phone makes sense in retrospect.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:04.300]   No, I predicted, no, I have a video of me predicting
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.060]   this exact thing 15 years ago.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.860]   It just made sense.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:09.500]   Well, I've been--
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.860]   Gene Rodden, very predicted it 40 years ago.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.900]   Right, I mean, you know, he didn't predict a watch,
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:14.980]   so there you go.
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.060]   So Philip was worried that this show, he said,
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.700]   it's not really two hours, is it?
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.620]   Philip, are you bored?
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.460]   No, but I'm getting hungry.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:26.580]   All right, we're going to move her along now.
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:29.140]   If you want to get some chicken fingers, I know a place.
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:31.740]   Our show today-- good to have you all, by the way.
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.860]   Great, great panel, great discussion.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.860]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:37.420]   Let me just check, because every time I do this ad,
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:47.140]   I like to see how many 43,766,976 royalty free stock images
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:51.180]   on Shutterstock, they added nearly 300,000 images last week.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.340]   And you might say, well, how am I going to find the image I
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:53.660]   want?
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.780]   Well, they have a great search.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.340]   I mean, it's a remarkable search.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.100]   Give me a noun.
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.180]   I mean, how about donut?
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:04.340]   We just had some delicious donuts.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:05.460]   Oh, there's some donuts.
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:09.340]   Now, that's just the beginning, because now you can refine
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:09.860]   your search.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.860]   I've got donuts, but maybe I want photos or vectors
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:13.540]   or illustrations.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.780]   Do I want horizontal or vertical images?
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:16.980]   How about the categories?
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:18.540]   You want donuts with people?
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:20.500]   How about only donuts with people?
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:25.820]   In fact, how about only donuts with people 70 years or older?
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.900]   How about--
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:28.700]   I'm not kidding.
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:29.500]   You can narrow it down.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.780]   And with that many choices, you're really great.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.980]   You can also choose the color palette.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:36.540]   And if you're a blogger or you have a publication,
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.260]   you're really going to want to make sure
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:40.460]   that it looks great with your site.
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:41.980]   I just am a huge fan.
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:42.700]   They have new.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:43.340]   They have popular.
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:43.980]   They have relevant.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.900]   And they have undiscovered.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:47.860]   That's always the place I go at Shutterstock.com.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:50.500]   These are the undiscovered donuts.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.060]   People haven't found these yet.
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.180]   Hidden donuts at Shutterstock.com.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:59.420]   They also have, if you click the Footage tab,
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.740]   a lot of great video footage, more than 2 million royalty
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.540]   free stock video clips.
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.380]   If you sign up for Shutterstock now,
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.820]   you can get free images, free video clips every week.
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:11.420]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.420]   See, they got music too.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.780]   Podcasters love this.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:17.020]   I'll tell you, though, I've been noticing in the credits
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:20.700]   lately of a lot of movies, you will see Shutterstock
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:23.700]   credited because filmmakers use Shutterstock all the time.
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:26.140]   Bloggers, publications.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:30.220]   It's just a great resource for horse-headed people.
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:32.140]   Shutterstock.com.
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.700]   I want you to take a look.
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:36.180]   Sign up for that free account so you could save images out
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.820]   to your-- there you go.
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:40.220]   There was one.
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:43.460]   There's an old man eating a donut.
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.420]   I love it.
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:46.420]   You could save those images out to your light box.
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:47.260]   Share them with friends.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.020]   All of that free.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.580]   You don't have to give them a credit card.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:51.940]   But if you decide you want to buy a subscription,
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:53.980]   we have the 25-image of today's subscription.

[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.060]   Shutterstock.com.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.940]   Browse around, create an account.
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.940]   It's free to do so.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:12.100]   And then if you decide to buy 20% off when
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:15.100]   you use the offer code, it's TWIT1014.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:15.980]   We love them.
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:20.500]   Shutterstock.com.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.180]   By the way, somebody was looking for your podcast, Ben.
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:24.300]   It's not called Stretecory.
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.660]   That's the site, Stretecory.com.
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:28.060]   The podcast is Exponent.
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:30.340]   Exponent.fm, is that right?
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:32.860]   Oh, he disappeared.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:35.180]   I said he could disappear if he wished.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:37.980]   He has a three-year-old who is now awake, probably.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:40.740]   Roku, according to the Wall Street Journal Deal Book,
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:45.900]   is considering a public offering.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:47.780]   People briefed on the matter on Friday.
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:50.180]   They're working with the Bank of Miracle, Merrill Lynch,
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.580]   Citigroup.
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.700]   Because this new Jobs Act allows you
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:28:00.020]   to do stealth groundwork for an IPO,
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.980]   they actually could be doing this already under the Jobs Act.
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:04.420]   If you have less than a billion in revenue,
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.620]   you could file it confidentially.
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:11.820]   I think it's an interesting play, given that Apple is about to,
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:15.220]   I think, explode the Apple TV sometime next year
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.660]   by putting in apps, put in an app store.
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:22.340]   You already see people like HBO and now Lionsgate announcing
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:25.500]   that they're going to go direct to customers.
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.100]   I think that's fascinating.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.020]   Two. OK, Ben's back.
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:30.740]   We can--
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.940]   What's the podcast?
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.380]   Exponent.fm, is that right?
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:35.980]   That's right.
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:36.900]   OK.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.620]   People were looking for it.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:42.740]   So a very interesting story that Lionsgate is going to consider
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:45.660]   taking not all but some of its films,
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:49.900]   along with the Tribeca Film Festival,
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:52.380]   and sell them direct to consumers.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:54.540]   I think when you combine that with CBS's announcement,
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.860]   it's going to stream online bypassing the cable companies.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:02.140]   HBO says some point next year, HBO Go will be something
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:05.700]   you could subscribe to without a cable company subscription.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:12.100]   We're about to see a very big shift in IPTV.
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:16.100]   There's one thing that will make that all happen or not, I believe,
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.740]   and that's the NFL, when they allow streaming of games
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:25.020]   or just the ability to watch a game as people can do in Germany
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.860]   now without having a cable subscription when that goes away.
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.860]   Well, that will be the tipping point.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:34.180]   Didn't they stream the Super Bowl this year?
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.460]   This year?
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:35.980]   I think they did.
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:38.660]   And I can't remember if you had to have a subscription or not.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:40.980]   If you had a Verizon account, you did not.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.700]   Yeah, Verizon's got that deal.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:43.660]   That's right.
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:44.140]   That's right.
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:45.460]   I think we're very close.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:46.860]   You know, the NBA is doing this.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.020]   They're bypassing ESPN.
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:52.860]   Or actually, I think it's with ESPN's help.
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:55.380]   Yeah, I mean, the NFL makes a lot of money from the networks.
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:55.900]   Yeah.
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:57.580]   I mean, it's trucked on.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.380]   Well, but it's really Comcast in there and Time Warner,
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.980]   the big cable companies, you got to fear.
[01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:02.780]   That's right.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:05.980]   They're not happy about this at all.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:07.340]   No, I actually disagree.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:09.260]   I think that--
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.420]   I mean, ESPN is doing this, but you have to--
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:17.700]   with ESPN, one, you have to--
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:18.780]   it had the ESPN service.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.860]   Or two, the stuff they sell directly
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:24.300]   is for games that are not televised otherwise.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.900]   So they're games that you can also
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:28.340]   get through NBA League Pass.
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:33.700]   If you get NBA League Pass or MLB or whatever,
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:37.380]   the nationally televised games are blocked out
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:38.740]   if you're in the US.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:42.900]   And the point is to protect those contracts.
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.500]   And the reality is for the HBO thing, to my opinion,
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:46.540]   has been way--
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.540]   I do think that change is coming.
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:52.300]   But the HBO thing has been way overplayed, in my opinion.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:56.260]   And the reason is because HBO was already only ever
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:58.940]   making money from people that watch HBO.
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:01.260]   Like HBO is not part of your standard cable package.
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:02.900]   You have to pay extra for it.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:06.980]   So it's a small step to go from people
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:10.820]   paying for HBO via their cable company to people paying HBO
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:11.660]   directly.
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:13.420]   But the fundamentals of their business model
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:15.020]   have not changed.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:21.100]   Except that they require currently a cable subscription
[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:22.620]   to watch them.
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:23.660]   Right, but that's--
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:26.580]   And if you're going to watch HBO currently,
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:29.940]   you have to get it through your cable company.
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:32.540]   But that's because HBO doesn't have the capability of--
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:33.220]   Right.
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:34.220]   --biting that money currently.
[01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:37.100]   They're going to piss off their distributor.
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:43.220]   But HBO, like right now, Time Warner rejected news
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:44.780]   corporations bid to take them over.
[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:46.340]   They have a lot of pressure to show growth.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.700]   So they're much more motivated to take on these sort of risks
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.300]   now than they were previously.
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:53.300]   The difference with ESPN and any other cable network
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:57.820]   is ESPN makes money from every single cable subscriber
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:00.380]   whether or not they watch ESPN.
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:02.420]   Which means-- so ESPN charges more than anyone.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:04.580]   It's like 550 per subscriber.
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:07.340]   So ESPN's making money from all these people
[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:09.620]   that do not watch ESPN.
[01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:10.740]   That's very different than HBO.
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:13.500]   That only makes money from people who explicitly get HBO.
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.500]   And so for ESPN to change this model
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:21.540]   is to forgo much, much, much more money than HBO's for going.
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:21.860]   Got it.
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:25.980]   And so HBO, I think, is way overplayed as an indicator.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:28.660]   So you're saying when ESPN goes, then--
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:29.780]   Pay attention.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.980]   --each man will be the last to go.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:34.980]   Because they have the most at stake in the current system.
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:38.820]   And that's why they paid out the nose for NBA.
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:42.220]   That's why sports fees are going through the stratosphere.
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:44.620]   Because you see lots of people in truth.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.420]   HBO think, well, I just need sports now.
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.260]   I can cut the cord.
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:47.980]   Well, guess what?
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:50.100]   That's the-- everyone knows that.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.620]   Which is why sports are going to be the way.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:52.580]   That's the only one saying that.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:53.300]   No, exactly.
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:56.100]   Because sports is one of those things where--
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.260]   Yeah, you got to watch live.
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:32:59.540]   You got to watch live.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.620]   People will pay for it.
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.820]   They'll pay to gradually, but they will pay.
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:05.220]   And that's why the fees are so high.
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:05.740]   The fees are high.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.940]   It's not just the advertising thing watching it live.
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:14.380]   It's they're high because it's people will pay for cable simply
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:15.780]   to get their sports.
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:18.780]   And that's also why we have these great shows, like AMC,
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:21.700]   for example, like The Walking Dead or Mad Men or other--
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:26.060]   or FX, the Americans, creating this amazing TV.
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.500]   This is what they've realized is the best way to make money
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:31.140]   is not to get more commercials.
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:35.060]   It's to create must-see shows where you can increase your carriage
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:37.820]   fee that you can charge the cable companies
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:40.500]   and which of course has passed on to us.
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.740]   And all this sort of stuff, all this great TV
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:46.940]   we're getting is actually a byproduct of the system
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:48.500]   that we all claim to hate.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.140]   But actually, if you look at it from a strictly economic
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:54.060]   perspective, is actually a pretty good deal.
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.940]   How much did CBS pay for Thursday night?
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:58.340]   And did they make money on it?
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:01.140]   Their ratings were good, I think.
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:02.700]   I'm sorry, I'd pay for what?
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:06.060]   CBS paid for Thursday night football.
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:08.860]   Oh, a ton of money, of course.
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:14.620]   It's the NFL is both the highest rated and the most expensive.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:19.900]   They won every Thursday night since early September
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.500]   with their NFL broadcast.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.420]   I think they were winning Thursday nights before,
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:25.900]   but the NFL is so valuable that they just--
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.620]   they moved it all to Monday night.
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:34.540]   And Larry Page is reorganizing Google promoting Sundar Pichai
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:37.140]   pretty much to his number two man, although Google's
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:40.420]   at Great Pains to say he's not a candidate for CEO.
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:44.380]   Pichai, who originally started with Chrome,
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.580]   I met him when he was pushing Chrome OS.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.380]   We thought we had a great debate over the future of Chrome OS.
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:51.100]   And Sundar, I'm sorry, I was wrong.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.460]   I thought there's no future.
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:53.260]   It's a browser.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:55.860]   It's not an operating system.
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:56.780]   Little did I know.
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:02.740]   Now he has research, search, maps, Google+, commerce,
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:08.260]   ad products, infrastructure, Android, Chrome, and Google Apps.
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:09.220]   Is there anything left?
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.700]   There's YouTube.
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.500]   That's Susan Wojcicki.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:17.820]   Apparently Nest will stay with Larry Page.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:22.220]   But basically, Page, I think, is saying, you run this business.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:25.180]   I have some other things I want to take care of.
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:27.140]   He says he's taking care of the bigger picture.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:31.220]   Nothing to say about that.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.460]   Moving on.
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.300]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.300]   Wait a minute.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:38.780]   I want Ben to talk about his theory that Google has peaked.
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.940]   You are a Ben fan, Philip.
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:41.580]   I am.
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:45.020]   And this is probably the most provocative thing
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:46.420]   written last week.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:47.140]   Google?
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.780]   Yeah, I loved the article, actually.
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:51.380]   And I think it hurt you to write it even,
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:55.500]   because as you admit in the article of Google fan, Ben,
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.820]   I wouldn't say I'm hurt per se.
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:00.380]   I think if I'm hurt by anything, it's
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:02.540]   that to write anything like this is risky,
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:08.060]   because anyone who accuses anyone like me or Philip
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:15.740]   or anyone who puts opinion pieces out there of looking
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:17.700]   for quicks couldn't be farther from the truth.
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:20.340]   There's way more risk in being wrong or something
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:22.740]   like that to your reputation.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:24.100]   No, take it from me into Vorak.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:28.020]   Being wrong has never hurt either of us.
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:29.940]   Well, I mean, where--
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.140]   Depends what your reputation you're looking for.
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:33.820]   Of course, I'm just going to leave that one.
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:36.540]   I'm not going to talk to you.
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:38.260]   But basically, my contention is not
[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:40.820]   that they, as a company, are in any trouble.
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:44.220]   I think that they own search deservedly.
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.340]   They will continue to own it for a very long time.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:48.220]   I'm actually relatively skeptical of people
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:49.820]   that think that their search business is--
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:53.620]   But owning search is a lot less than it did a few years ago.
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:56.580]   Well, it's like Microsoft still owns operating systems.
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.540]   So IBM still owns mainframes.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:00.220]   Exactly.
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:01.140]   That's the exact point.
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:06.140]   And the issue is that relative to mobile,
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:09.620]   relative to connected devices, they own a lot less,
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:11.180]   whereas their absolute numbers are still fine.
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:12.900]   They're still a very profitable company.
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:15.380]   And I think that this is connected to the HBO thing,
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:16.140]   actually.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.380]   I do agree through, Leo, that there is change coming.
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:21.340]   The tipping point is actually probably
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:24.660]   going to come more from the advertising side, where
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:26.860]   there's all these new formats we're figuring out.
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:30.180]   So things like Facebook, the new Facebook, the display ad
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:31.540]   in your feed, especially on mobile.
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:33.820]   It's a very compelling ad unit.
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:36.140]   There's the Pinterest-moded pins.
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:41.140]   And Pinterest, I think, is a massive giant that just only--
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:43.700]   hasn't even scratched the surface of this potential.
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:46.660]   There's advertorial type native advertising.
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:49.340]   There's all these sorts of new advertising formats
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:53.300]   that are way more compelling than old display ads ever were.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.780]   And as these are figured out and become more effective
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:58.900]   and have all the benefits of digital advertising,
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:01.300]   like the tracking and the targeting and things like that,
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:04.380]   you're going to see more and more money move from television.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.140]   Because if you take the advertising industry as a whole,
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.340]   the search advertising is $50 billion.
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.820]   That's a lot of money.
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:13.660]   Advertising as a whole is $500 billion.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:15.980]   So search is only a fraction of that,
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:20.220]   which means by definition, if a lot of that $500 billion
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:25.740]   moves online and Google still only ever has search,
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:27.460]   it's not that their business goes away.
[01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:31.260]   It just becomes less important, just like Microsoft's PC
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:32.500]   business never went away.
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.460]   And so when I said peak Google, it
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.700]   wasn't that the business is going to decline.
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:39.780]   It's that their relative importance
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:43.860]   in the arena that they compete in, which is advertising,
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:44.700]   will decline.
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:46.060]   I don't disagree with you.
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:47.860]   But didn't we say the same thing about Facebook?
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:50.060]   If they can't figure out mobile advertising,
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:50.620]   it's over.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:52.340]   And they kind of figured it out.
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:53.820]   It's not a mobile thing, though, I think.
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:57.060]   I think the challenge for Google is there's
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.380]   a very, very large exception here, which is YouTube.
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.340]   Setting aside YouTube, the rest of Google
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:04.380]   is really all about the algorithm.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.900]   And that's not just about the search results,
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:10.260]   but also about the way they serve ads, the auction system.
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:11.340]   It's all highly automated.
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:12.460]   It's very targeted.
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:15.620]   And it's a great system because people go to Google,
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:17.060]   they already want to buy.
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:18.420]   And Google presents the opportunity
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:19.780]   to buy right in front of them.
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:22.300]   It's a fantastic business.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:24.420]   However, the reason why there's so much more advertising
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.700]   at the high end of the funnel to use the term
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:31.540]   is because a lot of advertising is making people aware,
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:33.300]   aware that they have a problem, aware
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.740]   there's a product that fits their needs,
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:36.660]   or maybe just making them feel, especially when
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:39.300]   it comes to things like toothpaste,
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:42.940]   when Philip went to Walgreens to buy his toothpaste,
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:45.580]   people generally don't research toothpaste.
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:46.820]   They don't do comparisons.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:49.140]   They don't do check features, check lists.
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:50.580]   They go there and they grab a toothpaste.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.180]   They don't really think much about it.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:54.180]   But that choice has actually been heavily influenced
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.340]   by advertising.
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:58.780]   And it's something you buy toothpaste every month,
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:00.780]   every year for your entire life.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:03.060]   And so there's a lot of value to these companies
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:07.580]   to create affinity for a particular brand of toothpaste.
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:09.060]   And this is the sort of advertising
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:12.460]   that Google and Google's properties are not as good at.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:14.620]   Again, YouTube is a big exception here.
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:16.620]   And I probably didn't spend enough time on YouTube
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:17.860]   because it's fantastic.
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:20.420]   You point out in the article or at an addendum to the article,
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.780]   it's probably the best acquisition,
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:25.100]   one of the best acquisitions ever.
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:30.140]   No, for sure, because it really is Google's major foothold
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:32.940]   in the future in a very real way.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:33.700]   Again, it's interesting.
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:35.980]   Well, that's what I wonder is how nimble Google can be.
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:39.300]   And I would guess that the Sundar Pachaimov
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:44.740]   is probably exactly related to what you're talking about.
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:45.700]   That it's almost--
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:49.300]   Sundar, put your finger there and hold this.
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:50.140]   I just-- yeah, I'm just--
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:52.980]   Put your finger in this dike and let me, Larry Page,
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:55.020]   start to figure out what we're going to do next.
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:55.820]   It was also an aspect.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:57.420]   I mean, Larry Page just had a ton on his plate.
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:03.020]   I mean, he had like 10 or 12 executives reporting to him,
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:05.380]   which is a tremendous amount of--
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:06.380]   Well, he said--
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:08.300]   He said, I'm all I'm doing is reading reports all day.
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:09.860]   I can't do it anymore.
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:10.860]   Right, no, exactly.
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:13.420]   So I mean, I would hesitate to read too much
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:17.020]   into this beyond the fact that Sundar Pachaim is awesome.
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:19.140]   And is getting very powerful.
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:20.300]   Yeah, no, for sure.
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:20.660]   I mean--
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:21.140]   Rightly so.
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:23.060]   Yes, they clarified that he's not
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:24.260]   going to be CO tomorrow.
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:27.460]   But I mean, I would strongly suspect
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:30.740]   he's something where to happen where he paid you to be CEO.
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:31.740]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:35.700]   Isn't there a longer term issue that Google's got
[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:40.780]   at some point deal with that their main source of revenue
[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:48.300]   is advertising, and it's mostly coming from the US and Europe.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:50.380]   That's what's funding Google.
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:53.620]   Yet, Google is supplying the internet to the whole world.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:57.500]   And the growth of the internet in the whole world
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:00.140]   is not in the US and Europe.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.580]   That's saturated.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.820]   It's in developing countries--
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:06.340]   China, India, Brazil--
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:11.740]   where there isn't spending money on the kinds of stuff
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:12.940]   that Google advertised.
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.420]   Well, and Google doesn't even have a foothold
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:15.700]   in some of these countries.
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:16.500]   Right.
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:24.300]   But isn't there a disconnect between what's paying for the internet
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.660]   and where the internet is growing?
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:30.420]   And isn't that a problem for Google in the long run?
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:34.300]   Well, I think there's a fundamental challenge
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:36.900]   with all businesses, which is one is just
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:40.420]   maintain the current business, and two is growing.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.900]   And I think what you're articulating
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:45.300]   is a challenge to Google's growth going forward.
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:47.420]   I know Horace Dejuo of Asymco has put forward
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:50.900]   a very provocative theory that it's
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:54.580]   known fact that Google's revenue growth correlates
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:57.580]   to the growth of internet penetration.
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:00.460]   And that's set to peak in 2015, I think.
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:02.420]   And he wonders if Google's growth is also
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:03.860]   set to peak for the same reason.
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:04.860]   I don't know.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:07.780]   It's very possible.
[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:11.780]   And so yes, this is ending again, to go back to Microsoft.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:16.540]   The issue is not that they were shrinking.
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:18.660]   It's that the growth possibilities
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:20.500]   were seen to have become much more limited.
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:24.060]   And that's what kind of the stock price a lot of ways.
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:28.460]   So I think it's a reasonable thing to ask about Google.
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:32.580]   That said, I mean, search is not going anywhere.
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:34.700]   I think will remain for a very long time
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:38.860]   the best means of direct response advertising, which
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:43.020]   is advertising that's meant to elicit a purchase immediately.
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:44.740]   So it's brand advertising that you
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:45.540]   think they're going to lose.
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.940]   And that's where the biggest money is spent, of course.
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:48.500]   Exactly.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:50.060]   And that's where I think they're going
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:54.300]   to have less of a foothold than people will think.
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:57.380]   Again, the analogy being like Microsoft with mobile.
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:59.060]   And I think to extend the analogy,
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:03.380]   it's just because this skills and what's
[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:08.180]   needed to win in that category is actually a lot different
[01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:11.340]   than what's necessary to win in direct response advertising.
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:15.580]   And I just think Google's not in as strong a place either
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:21.340]   from a product perspective, like Google Plus not Facebook.
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:24.060]   But also, I think just more from a cultural approach
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:24.860]   perspective.
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.980]   And again, it doesn't make it a bad business.
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:30.980]   It makes an amazing business that I'm not
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.780]   by any means trying to sell short.
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:35.140]   But does not necessarily mean they'll
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:38.020]   be as dominant in online advertising in five years
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:40.460]   or 10 years as they are today.
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:42.380]   That's kind of the way the world and technology,
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:43.580]   this stuff moves a lot faster.
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:46.740]   Horace has wrote and written a lot about the trajectory
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.780]   of successful companies.
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:50.340]   And it's changed in the tech business.
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:54.260]   The cycle's very short now.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:55.100]   It's hard to stay on top.
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.420]   The cycle.
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:57.260]   Yeah, the cycle's short.
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:59.020]   Google were the ones that brought
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.100]   DR direct response to the web.
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:03.140]   Prior to that, branding was what it was.
[01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:06.100]   And really, the web is best for branding.
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:08.420]   Podcasts are even better.
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:09.060]   But--
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.420]   Yes, let's all say that.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:11.660]   We all have podcasts.
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:14.260]   Podcasts are even better.
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:15.980]   Podcasts are even better than the web.
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:19.260]   There's no accident that Horace that Ben have entered
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:24.860]   this market that you and I, Dave, have so long embraced.
[01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:25.900]   There's no way.
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:27.460]   No better way that I've found them.
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:30.980]   We've been in the advertising business for 15 years, 16 years
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:32.780]   now.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:35.780]   But direct response works on the web.
[01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:38.860]   The problem with the web is you can track the click.
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:40.140]   Billboard still works.
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:42.180]   But nobody tracks the number of cars
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:45.300]   that crash into them as a success metric.
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.900]   One is one too many.
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:48.780]   It's true.
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:49.820]   But that's why it's hard to say--
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:51.380]   I mean, I don't know about you, but I have a hard time
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:53.260]   selling brand advertising because it's
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:55.580]   hard to measure the impact.
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:58.020]   And we get to thank Google for that.
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:45:59.940]   Because Google was really smart.
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:03.380]   When they came out with the whole AdSense or an AdWords thing,
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:08.060]   they didn't sell people on the results of the ad.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:12.860]   They sold people on wanting a report that looked good,
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:14.300]   which is how people are.
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:18.540]   And so Google built reports that showed you everything,
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:21.860]   but focused on the one number that Google charged you for,
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.420]   the click.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.060]   And this was brilliant.
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:28.460]   And it sucked for us because we were previously
[01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:29.860]   in the business of brand advertising.
[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:31.220]   And it worked.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:32.620]   People saw Lyft.
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:34.180]   All this stuff was there.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:36.100]   And then Google came in and said, hey,
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:37.820]   we can bring DR to the web.
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:40.980]   It's like, no, it's better elsewhere.
[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:44.660]   Because people, the whole click and then buy thing,
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:47.460]   tracking the success of an ad by the number of people
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:50.540]   that click on it is so counterintuitive
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:53.860]   to the way advertising and branding and human minds
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:54.540]   work.
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:57.700]   And yet it's what the entire business wants to look at.
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:59.860]   And people are wrong to look at this.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:02.940]   But it's total human nature to say, oh, there's
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:04.660]   a number I can finally look at.
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:07.420]   We've been advertising for hundreds of years.
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:10.860]   And suddenly now, we've decided that, oh, the most important
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:13.540]   thing is tracking the number of people that touched on my ad.
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:14.540]   No.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:15.060]   No.
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:19.020]   From your maps to somebody's year.
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:21.820]   What I think we see, though, is a lot of the companies
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:25.580]   that have advertising the web traditionally have been--
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:27.660]   the real money in branding advertising
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:31.260]   is in companies like P&G, you know, like Tied.
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:32.180]   Right.
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:33.860]   And they're buying football.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.060]   It's a long play.
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:36.500]   They want these eyeballs.
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:39.980]   They're still mostly all on TV because, yeah, it's a--
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:40.500]   exactly.
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:41.340]   It's a long play.
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:44.300]   It's a great way to put it in every respect of the word.
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:48.220]   And it's also interesting to talk about Facebook
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:49.660]   and kind of their appless sort of thing.
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:52.100]   We talked about all the data from your credit card transactions.
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:56.980]   Like Apples or Facebook is their offer
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:59.540]   is to connect online advertising all the way
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.620]   to those transactions.
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:04.780]   And so because it is attractive,
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:05.620]   Dave's exactly right.
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:08.980]   The idea of being able to understand where your money is
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:09.420]   spent.
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:10.980]   It's the whole--
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:12.860]   what's the added jump my co-op
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:13.940]   mentions the next month of this week.
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:17.900]   But a marketer tells you, I know 50% of my money
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:18.620]   is very effective.
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:21.460]   I just don't know which 50%.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.740]   And that's the phrase we've been using
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:24.580]   in advertising for decades.
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:25.060]   Yeah, years.
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:25.580]   Right.
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:26.060]   No, exactly.
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:27.740]   The problem is the whole--
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:30.780]   any marketer will tell you, like, the reason they know it
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:32.580]   works is because when they stop spending, their sales
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:33.100]   go down.
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:33.580]   Right.
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:36.660]   And that's still the biggest indicator
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:38.060]   of the success of advertising.
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:38.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.860]   This is a whole show I'd love to do with you guys.
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.740]   A whole show on this subject.
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:45.980]   Certainly something of great interest to us.
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:48.580]   But we do have to take a break for a fine advertisement
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:51.620]   from one of our fine sponsors.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.300]   You know, Whitman Ford was an advertiser.
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:56.500]   Now, there's a brand-- that's a brand campaign for Ford.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:58.340]   And they spent a couple of million dollars, I think,
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:01.820]   over the two or three years they were with us.
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:03.580]   Well, they had no way to measure.
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:06.220]   I mean, you can't measure the sales of cars
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:08.820]   based on podcast ads.
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:10.980]   But they were very happy because they did research.
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:15.180]   And there's ways to find out if people are seeing it.
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.420]   Well, what's compelling about podcast advertising
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:22.180]   why it's been so successful is it's a native ad ad.
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:25.980]   And what I mean by that is it's in the same format
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:27.380]   as the content that I wanted.
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:28.380]   Exactly.
[01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:28.580]   Exactly.
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:33.180]   And that's-- and so I use the word native ad in my article.
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:35.260]   And I almost regret it because people immediately think
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:37.500]   that like it's paid for articles.
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:39.980]   But what I mean is I think podcast ads
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:41.420]   are a great native ad.
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:42.980]   You mean native to the media.
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:44.500]   You mean native to the media.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:47.100]   And so people are working out or they're driving their car.
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:48.700]   And yeah, some people click through it.
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:51.660]   But a lot of people just like our content to listen to it.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:53.140]   And that's enough.
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:54.500]   And that gets the job done.
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:55.500]   Right.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:01.340]   Love to have Ford back just saying that you know what
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:01.940]   tastes all this.
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:02.780]   They said, yeah, that was great.
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:03.580]   It was a good experiment.
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:04.500]   We love buying podcasts.
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:06.260]   They didn't just buy us about many podcasts.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:07.180]   But that's it.
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:09.500]   We're done.
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:14.260]   It's such a blip when you're spending $60 million
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:17.220]   on television ads every week.
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:18.340]   A million here, a million there.
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:20.020]   You don't even notice.
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:21.220]   Chicken feet, times.
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:22.900]   Yeah, there's just an efficiency problem.
[01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:24.260]   That's the problem.
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:27.420]   We should all combine into a giant--
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.740]   any time you guys want to bring your shows here,
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.660]   and Philip, you should do a show too.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:34.420]   We'll just combine it into a giant blob.
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:35.860]   Go back to Dearborn.
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.300]   Our show today, Brian--
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:39.020]   The roll up content.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:40.940]   Well, that's what happened before.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:45.380]   But the problem is the reason that you do podcasts,
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:47.820]   and I do a podcast, and Ben does a podcast, and Horace
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:50.180]   does a podcast, is because they're all bloody-minded
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:52.060]   individualists.
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:54.580]   And with make enough money, each of us,
[01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:55.820]   so we don't have to worry about it.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.100]   And nobody's really trying to take over the world,
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.620]   except Jason Calicanis.
[01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:02.220]   He's trying to take it.
[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:06.580]   Our show brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:07.820]   If you're going to the post office,
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:11.060]   you're wasting your time, because you can now
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:14.220]   buy and print official US postage on demand
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:17.820]   from your computer and your printer any time, day or night,
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:18.420]   that you need it.
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.860]   And if you're in the business of sending out stuff,
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:23.300]   fulfillment-- if you're sending out brochures, bills,
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:26.700]   if you're at eBay or Etsy seller, and you're not using
[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:28.620]   Stamps.com, you're crazy.
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:33.020]   You're missing out on the efficiency of this system.
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.660]   Stamps.com gives you everything you need.
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:35.460]   You get the software.
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:37.060]   You'll get a digital scale, so you'll never
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:40.380]   overpay or underpay postage.
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:41.740]   They will fill out forms.
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:44.300]   As you work, for instance, they take it right from the Etsy
[01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:46.980]   website or the eBay website, fill out the forms,
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:48.260]   even international forms.
[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:48.900]   You get discounts.
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:51.700]   You can't get at the post office, discounted package
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:53.500]   insurance, and just one click.
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.540]   Print out Certified Mail, return receipt,
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:57.940]   international customs forms automatically.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:01.020]   You never again will write out the recipient's address.
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:03.220]   It takes it right from the address book or the website.
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:04.260]   You won't write your address.
[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.860]   It prints right on envelopes with your company's logo.
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:10.100]   It makes you look professional.
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.860]   And that's really the value of Stamps.com.
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:14.540]   Sure, it's going to save you time and money,
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:18.260]   but it makes you look like you really know what you're doing.
[01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:19.460]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:22.820]   We've got a no risk offer that's so fantastic.
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.860]   If you go-- in fact, probably when you went there,
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:26.060]   you didn't believe it.
[01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:27.740]   Go to Stamps.com.
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.740]   There's a microphone at the top there.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:31.820]   Click the microphone, enter the offer code TWIT.
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:32.700]   Oh, I like that.
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:33.540]   Look at that.
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:35.340]   They've got a new landing page.
[01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:36.940]   And say, go.
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:40.300]   And we got $110 value here for you.
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:41.900]   The digital scale is free.
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:43.380]   You pay $5 shipping and handling.
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:44.660]   So the only reason I can't say it's free
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:46.260]   is because you have to pay the shipping and handling.
[01:52:46.260 --> 01:52:47.820]   But they more than make up for that.
[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:50.260]   With $55 in postage coupons, you can
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:52.180]   use over the life of your account.
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:53.380]   That's awesome.
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:55.580]   They make up for it with a $5 activity kit.
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:58.260]   And of course, a month free of Stamps.com.
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:00.020]   So this is a really great trial offer.
[01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:01.500]   It's one of the best we offer.
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:02.780]   And I want you to try it right now.
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:04.420]   Stamps.com.
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:06.580]   Click the microphone.
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:07.580]   Look at this.
[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:09.140]   If you just go to the front page, it says,
[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:09.700]   give us a try.
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.780]   Get $5 in free postage.
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:13.420]   No, click the microphone.
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:14.020]   Enter TWIT.
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.540]   $55.
[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:19.260]   $50 more in free postage just for clicking the microphone.
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:20.100]   I think that's fair.
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:20.860]   It's a good deal.
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:21.300]   You know what?
[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:22.100]   We had a great week.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.380]   This is some of the stuff you missed if you missed anything
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:25.220]   on TWIT this week.
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:27.020]   Previously on TWIT.
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:30.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:31.340]   My illusion.
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.620]   I'm mixing my shows.
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:34.700]   I'm at Break Weekly.
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:37.260]   We have a video we sent Jeff Needle to Whole Foods
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:38.820]   to buy chicken fingers.
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:40.500]   Seize it, pops up your credit card,
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.820]   receipt comes out, and you're done.
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:42.820]   Approved.
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:43.740]   Apple magic.
[01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:45.540]   Apple magic.
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:46.940]   I5 for the iPhone.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:49.940]   Well, a new feature in iOS 8.1
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:54.540]   lets you get text messages on your Mac or other iOS device
[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:55.620]   that isn't your iPhone.
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:59.140]   So basically, it makes SMS act like iMessage.
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:00.060]   Windows Weekly.
[01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:02.420]   Sunshine Adele was given that $13.5 million.
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:05.260]   Just stick around just in case you can see you.
[01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:07.060]   We don't really care if he leaves, do we?
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:07.860]   Oh, a little bit.
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:08.380]   Right.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:09.460]   Give him a couple million.
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:10.620]   See what happens.
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:13.140]   Could you even grasp some coffee while the big boy is tired?
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:14.460]   Tech News Tonight.
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:16.700]   28-year-old man has been sentenced to two years
[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:19.500]   in prison in Japan, the first person in the world
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:22.820]   known to have received a jail sentence for making
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:24.420]   3D printed firearms.
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:25.420]   TWIT.
[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:27.420]   Some assembly required.
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:30.820]   Felix Baumgartner's record has been broken, ladies
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:35.020]   and gentlemen, the Red Bull Stratosphere Skydiver
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:37.820]   has been bested by an amateur.
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.380]   He's actually a vice president at Google.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:42.700]   Alan used his senior vice president, very well-known guy
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:44.140]   in the computer industry.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:47.180]   For three years, in secret, in private,
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:49.180]   he has been planning this parachute
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:56.140]   to break the world record for high-altitude jumps.
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:58.900]   He-- Google offered to help subsidize it.
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:02.940]   They said, no, it'll become too commercial.
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:03.620]   I got the video.
[01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:04.580]   Let me show you the video.
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:06.860]   This is so awesome.
[01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:11.540]   He's jumping from a balloon.
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:14.020]   What worked with a company called Paragon Space
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:15.540]   Development Company, the corporation.
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:16.700]   They made his space suit.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:17.460]   There he goes.
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:19.100]   They just pulled a trigger.
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:22.740]   And he's floating.
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:24.340]   Bye-bye.
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:34.340]   25 miles high on a giant helium-filled balloon.
[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:36.060]   You've got to be nuts.
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:36.860]   He's 57.
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:39.700]   It looks like a future Darwin award winner.
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:41.260]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:42.820]   There he is in his space suit.
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:44.180]   He didn't have Red Bull.
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:46.340]   All he had was a couple of GoPros.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:47.860]   Pulled the trigger.
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:49.340]   Fell for 15 minutes.
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:51.820]   Broke the sound barrier.
[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:53.380]   You could hear his sonic boom on the ground.
[01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:56.660]   He didn't hear it, of course, because he was faster than the speed
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.460]   of sound for a while.
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.180]   Then floats.
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:02.460]   There are people that grown up to apparently hear this on a cool--
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:07.940]   They could hear him as he's coming in through the atmosphere.
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:11.660]   And then he lands, goes flopped.
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:14.580]   And he's broken the world record.
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:17.220]   And he did it for fun and for science and not for Red Bull.
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:19.180]   And I like that.
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:27.260]   Total fall was 135,890 feet.
[01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:30.580]   And that's pretty good.
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:33.940]   He didn't-- it probably gets hot when you get past--
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:35.860]   when you get up into the stratosphere,
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:37.180]   it starts to heat up from the sun.
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:39.100]   So he didn't want to move.
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:43.260]   So instead of moving to flick his radio switch, when the ground--
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:44.820]   the ground talked to him on the radio,
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:48.980]   he would just shift his legs slightly to say yes.
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:51.380]   You think of it as being cold up there.
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:52.980]   I was very surprised that it was hot.
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:53.460]   It was.
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:55.460]   Yeah.
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:57.140]   But it gets cold as you get higher.
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:59.340]   Obviously, beyond the stratosphere into space,
[01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:00.500]   it's pretty chilly up there.
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:01.620]   Mine is too sunny.
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:03.860]   Isn't it like the side that's on the sun?
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:04.740]   It's super hot.
[01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:05.240]   Right.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:06.380]   The sun heats you up.
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:06.900]   Right.
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:07.380]   Right.
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:07.580]   It's like--
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:07.980]   Well, actually, that's right.
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:09.140]   That's a problem in spacecraft.
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:12.300]   They have to cool it and heat it.
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:13.900]   Anyway, he did this all in secret.
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:16.700]   Didn't do it for-- I love that.
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:19.340]   Anybody here have the new Google Inbox app, by the way?
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:22.620]   I want to point out that you should ask for an invitation.
[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:24.380]   Google is trying to reinvent email.
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:26.180]   And you know what?
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:28.620]   It's awesome.
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:29.940]   Awesome sauce.
[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:31.740]   How do you get an invitation?
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:34.100]   Go to inbox.google.com and request one.
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:35.700]   Some of the people in our chat room
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:40.220]   have said they've got one within a few days of asking for it.
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:42.540]   If you get one, you get, I think, three invitations.
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:43.180]   Don't ask me.
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:46.660]   I've already given mine to Mike Elgin and Sarah Lane.
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:48.420]   What it does is it really lets you--
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:49.660]   it's fast email triage.
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:50.860]   They're basing it.
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:52.420]   Others have done something similar.
[01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:59.260]   Mailbox was the first to do this kind of swiping to handle
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:01.140]   in a message.
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.420]   And Outlook, we have to give credit to outlook.com.
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:06.780]   Microsoft invented the idea of sweeping your inbox.
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:09.340]   But altogether, I am really impressed with this.
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:12.300]   And I have a horrible inbox.
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:14.020]   One of the worst.
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:16.420]   So these are bundles.
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:17.060]   They're folders.
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:19.060]   Anything I want to see here?
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:20.140]   No, I'll sweep it.
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:21.740]   Goodbye.
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:24.940]   If I say, oh, I want to respond to this later,
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:28.300]   I can open it and I can either pin it.
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:33.180]   Let's sweep it over and say, I'll deal with this tomorrow.
[01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:35.700]   Deal with this tomorrow.
[01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:37.660]   Deal with this tomorrow.
[01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:39.460]   And then sweep away the stuff I don't want.
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:41.580]   It's really fabulous.
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:43.260]   Really fabulous.
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:45.260]   Mobile only?
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:48.100]   No, it is mobile and web.
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:49.940]   So if you go to inbox.google.com,
[01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:52.500]   once you've set it up with your Gmail account,
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.900]   it will work on the web, Android and iOS.
[01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:56.020]   But here's what's interesting.
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:57.540]   It's just another interface to Gmail.
[01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:02.780]   So everything you do on inbox modifies your Gmail account.
[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:05.220]   I am very impressed.
[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:06.140]   This is a--
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:08.460]   Only works with personal Gmail accounts.
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:10.300]   Does it work if you have your own domain?
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:11.060]   Nope.
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:12.020]   Yeah.
[01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:12.500]   Nope.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:16.060]   And that pisses Jeff Jarvis off, no end.
[01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:18.180]   But I am really impressed.
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:19.820]   This is a challenging problem.
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:24.620]   I imagine for all of you and certainly for me,
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:26.420]   just a little word of encouragement.
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:26.780]   Thank you.
[01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:28.340]   Keep it up.
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:28.820]   No.
[01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:30.380]   No, it's fascinating to see.
[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:32.540]   I mean--
[01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:33.780]   It's not going to save Google.
[01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:35.020]   Don't get me wrong, Ben.
[01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:36.420]   Oh, no, I'm still peaked.
[01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:39.980]   Yeah, I'm going to--
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:40.820]   I'm in trouble.
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:43.020]   You're in deep due to my friend.
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:47.420]   No, it is a much more compelling sort of experience
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:49.340]   and immersive sort of experience.
[01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:51.780]   I don't know-- it'd be interesting to see what would work
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:53.100]   from an ad perspective in there or not.
[01:59:53.100 --> 02:00:00.540]   I mean, certainly there are ads in Gmail, famously so.
[02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:02.820]   Yeah, I haven't seen any ads in this yet.
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:03.620]   Well, of course not.
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:05.500]   Not when they want to do product.
[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:09.420]   But one can imagine it being much more effective delivery
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:12.300]   for ads than a traditional Gmail interface would be.
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:16.380]   I mean, they've tested, I think, having basically emails.
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:17.740]   Or you have them, I think, now, and you're
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:20.300]   really going to interface like the top thing is like an ad.
[02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:20.820]   It's right.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:22.020]   It's in there.
[02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:24.980]   But A, it's kind of crudely an ad and B,
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:26.420]   where it's not really an ad and B,
[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:27.900]   indistinguishable from spam.
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:30.460]   I mean, just advertising and email is a tough--
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:32.700]   They have-- and they do this in the categories on Gmail,
[02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:34.540]   too, this promotional--
[02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:37.620]   they automatically filter promotional stuff in there.
[02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:40.100]   And they've been putting ads in there, by the way,
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:41.460]   knowing that people look at it.
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:44.180]   And they still have that.
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:45.780]   I think that that's not a bad idea.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:48.660]   Just acknowledge, hey, there's going to be ads in here.
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:50.540]   I just sweep them.
[02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:52.420]   Goodbye.
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:58.020]   But I guess at some point, hello.co, the Facebook killer
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:00.220]   that is going to kill Facebook by being private
[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:04.980]   has taken another big chunk of venture capital, $5.5 million.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:07.220]   They know, of course, that that makes people
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:12.980]   worry because anybody who invests in a website like hello.co
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:15.940]   expects an exit at some point.
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.300]   So they signed a legally binding charter,
[02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:23.300]   shackled themselves to their manifesto
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:25.300]   that they would never sell ads or data.
[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:31.660]   How do they enforce that if someone else--
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.220]   Do they sue themselves?
[02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:34.460]   I think they sue themselves.
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:38.420]   If they sell the company and there's new management,
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:39.980]   how's the new management bound by that?
[02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.900]   No, that's probably right there, not.
[02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:42.380]   Maybe, though.
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:42.740]   I don't know.
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:44.820]   I'd have to read the manifesto.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:45.980]   I think they are.
[02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:48.020]   I think the way it works is they are bound by it,
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:48.820]   even under a sale.
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:49.980]   I think that's part of it.
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:53.300]   I mean, the bigger issue is that it's not clear who's
[02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:54.980]   going to want to buy them because they're not
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:55.660]   going to be successful.
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:57.980]   Right.
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:00.980]   So there.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:03.500]   I mean, the problem is to start a social network
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:06.100]   is already unbelievably difficult.
[02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:07.380]   I mean, there's a reason why there's
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:10.540]   a value-bills because they're very--
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:11.940]   They got some attention.
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:12.900]   --of their own banking.
[02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:16.180]   You have the whole network effective to get people on.
[02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:19.020]   And the problem is because their number one priority
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:23.860]   is not creating a social network, it's avoiding ads.
[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:26.420]   And that's a small distinction, but it matters.
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:28.580]   And the reason it matters is because how are they
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:29.180]   going to monetize?
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:31.660]   They're going to monetize by selling premium features.
[02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:32.660]   That's what they said.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:34.700]   And well, by definition, for example,
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:36.100]   there's a combination Twitter.
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:37.820]   Is your data portable?
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:38.940]   Well, you can pay for it.
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:41.580]   Well, OK.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:44.660]   The problem is that by definition,
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:47.420]   they are not offering the best possible product
[02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:51.020]   that they can because they need to keep something back to sell.
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:54.460]   And which makes it even harder to get new users.
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:58.780]   Because it's already so hard to get users.
[02:02:58.780 --> 02:03:00.540]   And you're putting yourself behind the eight ball
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:03.540]   and you're actually holding back features.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:07.100]   There's a reason why all social networks are ad supported.
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:09.700]   It's because they need to be super awesome
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:13.260]   from a product perspective for anyone to even use it.
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.100]   And they need to be free.
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:19.900]   There needs to be zero barrier to entry for users to get on it.
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:22.300]   And yes, in the long run, you can argue that as a track
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:23.380]   from user experience.
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:26.380]   But the reality is Facebook is very highly motivated
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:29.420]   to make it compelling to use because they know
[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:35.540]   that's to it and making it more annoying in some ways.
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:41.140]   New York's to say I'm skeptical.
[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:44.380]   The FCC is going to delay the auction of the 700 megahertz
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:44.780]   bandwidth.
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:47.180]   They got back from analog television stations
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:49.460]   at least to next year.
[02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:52.340]   Phone company's not happy about that.
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:54.780]   Pew survey says 40% of internet users
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:56.540]   have experienced online harassment,
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:02.660]   18% in severe form, 72% have seen it happen.
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:03.260]   What a surprise.
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:08.820]   Age and gender are most closely associated
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:11.060]   with the experience of online harassment.
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:17.980]   Among young adults, 65% have been the target of harassment.
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:19.140]   65%.
[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:23.940]   And young women, of course, 26% have been stocked online,
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:28.820]   25% were the target of online sexual harassment.
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:31.100]   Dangerous place.
[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:32.580]   Screw the internet.
[02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:35.220]   I'm going to LO.co.
[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:38.140]   Well, that's a good example.
[02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:42.340]   I mean, LO launched without any sort of blocking
[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:43.420]   or any sort of--
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:44.140]   I still don't have it.
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:45.940]   That's a premium feature.
[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:47.140]   No, I think they did add it.
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:49.180]   I mean, it is kind of like--
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:50.380]   You need to have it.
[02:04:50.380 --> 02:04:57.100]   I mean, this is--
[02:04:57.100 --> 02:05:00.740]   I'm jumping in here because I hate to make white--
[02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:03.380]   it's easy to-- what's happening on the internet
[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:06.660]   is really weightily and I think in our little corner
[02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:09.820]   of the world is really kind of appalling.
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:13.860]   And it's one thing to talk about to be an absolutist,
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:16.660]   about free speech and the importance of that
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:20.860]   when you're in an analog environment,
[02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:23.580]   but you have a thing like Twitter
[02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:25.980]   where people can generate just untold number
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:29.940]   of anonymous accounts and there's--
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:31.900]   no one knows who you are and it's anonymous.
[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:34.620]   I mean, there's some very real issues,
[02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:36.140]   I think, that are being raised now.
[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:39.940]   And I think requires a lot of awfulness.
[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:41.660]   And it's--
[02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:43.300]   There's been a lot of time talking about this.
[02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:44.660]   Everything is easy.
[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:45.940]   It makes everything easy.
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:48.380]   That worries me because the internet is probably
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:50.780]   the most important invention, certainly of our era,
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:52.860]   probably of many years.
[02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:58.460]   And yet, it is a tool that is being wielded against people too
[02:05:58.460 --> 02:06:00.220]   and that's terrible.
[02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:01.220]   I want to thank you guys.
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.660]   We're in the early stages of it.
[02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:03.860]   I know.
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:05.500]   And we got to solve this though, right Dave?
[02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:06.260]   We got to solve this.
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:07.660]   I totally agree.
[02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:10.820]   But first cars came out, we didn't really have roads.
[02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:12.260]   And then we had to figure out roads and rules.
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:15.020]   Have people kept driving into billboards, right?
[02:06:15.020 --> 02:06:16.020]   That's a problem.
[02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:18.420]   That's where successful back then.
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:21.660]   I want to thank you, Dave Hamilton, from Mac Observer
[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:24.740]   and the Mac GeekGab podcast.
[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:26.740]   Nice.
[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:28.740]   They said it slowly.
[02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:29.580]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:30.180]   Start slow.
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:31.180]   That's it, baby steps.
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:31.740]   Baby steps.
[02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:33.180]   I'll work up to full speed later.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.020]   It's great to have you.
[02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:34.300]   It's right.
[02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:34.980]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:35.740]   I really appreciate it.
[02:06:35.740 --> 02:06:36.660]   Thanks so much for having me.
[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:37.220]   I appreciate it.
[02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:38.100]   Ben, you're brilliant.
[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:39.780]   As always, love having you.
[02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:40.940]   Stretecory.com.
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:42.780]   And don't forget, exponent.fm.
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:44.580]   He got up early to be with us.
[02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:49.060]   But his brain worked even then.
[02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:49.900]   Mine would be here.
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:51.820]   Mine would not be working at that hour of the morning,
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:53.740]   so I thank you.
[02:06:53.740 --> 02:06:55.620]   Really appreciate it, Ben.
[02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:59.260]   And a hearty thanks to our first timer on the show.
[02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:02.100]   Philip Elmer DeWitt, I am a huge fan.
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:03.420]   And I'm so glad you could be here.
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:04.900]   I hope you will come back.
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:07.940]   That two hours went by like that, right?
[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:10.300]   Except it's practically my bedtime.
[02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:11.420]   Go have dinner.
[02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:12.460]   Go have something to eat.
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:14.580]   You've earned yourself a beer.
[02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:15.700]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:18.700]   We do a twit every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific now.
[02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:22.060]   We're in a weird times shift area here,
[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:25.260]   because in some parts of the world, we've left summer time.
[02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:26.540]   We haven't left it here.
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:32.180]   So today it was a 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2,000
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:35.940]   UTC next week, 2,100 UTC.
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:39.740]   So adjust yourself accordingly.
[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:40.140]   You know what?
[02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:41.940]   The solution, just watch twit all the time.
[02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:44.740]   And eventually, the show will be on.
[02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:46.020]   If you can't do that, though, you
[02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:48.300]   can download on-demand and watch it whenever you want.
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:51.100]   That's at twit.tv or wherever you get your podcasts and,
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:55.620]   of course, Stitcher and Podcast and Instacast
[02:07:55.620 --> 02:07:56.820]   and all the different clients.
[02:07:56.820 --> 02:07:59.860]   And our own excellent Twit clients
[02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:01.380]   written by third party developers.
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:03.220]   And we thank them for doing that.
[02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:07.540]   You can also see us on YouTube and pretty much everywhere.
[02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:08.380]   But do watch.
[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:09.340]   Subscribe if you can.
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:11.100]   You don't want to miss an episode.
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:11.980]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:13.060]   Thanks for being in the studio.
[02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:14.300]   We had a nice studio audience today.
[02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:15.900]   You can email tickets@twit.tv if you'd
[02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:17.660]   like to join us in the studio.
[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:18.380]   I appreciate it.
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:21.620]   It is a long two hours, especially on those chairs.
[02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:22.100]   Right?
[02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:24.980]   Oh, boy, am I getting nods.
[02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:25.860]   Sorry about that.
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:28.660]   We're going to get better chairs.
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:29.300]   All right, friends.
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:30.060]   Thanks for being here.
[02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:30.660]   We'll see you next time.
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:31.300]   Another Twit.
[02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:32.180]   This is amazing.
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:32.700]   OK.
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:33.180]   Oh, bye.
[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:36.620]   [APPLAUSE]
[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:37.620]   Do on the Twitter.
[02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:38.460]   All right.
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:40.300]   Do on the Twitter, baby.
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:41.100]   Do on the Twitter.
[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:42.100]   All right.
[02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:43.980]   Do on the Twitter, baby.
[02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:44.780]   Do on the Twitter.
[02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:45.780]   All right.
