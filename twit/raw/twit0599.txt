[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. What a great show we have for you. Oh, and J.J. Stone. He's full of it today.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.080]   We've got Michael Nunez from Gizmodo.

[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.320]   And we've got two refugees on the program today. We're gonna talk about Silicon Valley's reaction to the
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.960]   immigration executive order. We've got lots of news about data mining, artificial intelligence, and one
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.920]   one of our hosts is a cyborg. Find out why and how next on Twit.

[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   What a week it has been.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   But we've got a great team here to discuss it, joining us from his secret lair somewhere on the east coast.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.280]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   I don't know what to say. We're in cat ears.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   I'm actually scared to be here today. It's been a rough week, Leo.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   It has undisclosed location indeed.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   Yeah, you know, you got to get technology is still a foot. We need it.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   Get down and be here with you. Get down in the bunker there, Owen.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   My cave has Wi-Fi. That's all we need.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   Also joining us Phil Liben.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   You remember Phil, he's been on the show course many times, but he's also former CEO and one of the founders that ever known he's now managing director of general catalistory.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.280]   He invests in technology. Feel great to have you.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   Nice to be back.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   And I like it. Your timing is good because you are not only an immigrant.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   Your family was a refugee family from the Soviet Union.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   That's right.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   So you have some standing to talk about the latest immigration and technology news.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   And also joining us for only for a second time in a year.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   So we got to get you on more often.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   Michael Nunez, he is at gizmodo.com.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   Great to have you back, Michael.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   Yeah, thanks for the invite. I'm glad to be back.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280]   Yeah, I apologize for not getting you back sooner.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   What's your beat at gizmodo?
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   So I'm the technology editor here.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   So I'm basically just overseeing it.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   Well, there is it down quite a bit.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   So it's a pretty broad scope, but we do our best to basically cover everything that we see.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   That's important.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   And you work with Christina Warren, of course, over there.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.280]   Yeah, yeah. She's a relatively new addition, but she has been amazing.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   It's been great to have her, you know, honorably.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.280]   You know, on our side.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.280]   If you're watching the video, we're going to call Michael Goose today on the show.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.280]   I don't know why.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.280]   I don't know why.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   So I mean, I guess we have to talk about it.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   You know, I have mixed feelings about talking about politics.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.280]   We try to keep to politics only where the Internet intersects with technology.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.280]   But in fact, there's a pretty big intersection.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   This is, of course, the concluding of President Trump's first week in office,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   a lot of executive orders.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.680]   And one yesterday that seemed to have really triggered a reaction from Silicon Valley.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.320]   I shouldn't even say that from all of the tech community.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:17.320]   And that's his ban on immigrants, visitors from seven nations that are predominantly
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.320]   Muslim.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.160]   But more than that, even green card holders, legal residents of the United States, were
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.640]   blocked at the border.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.000]   There was some question of whether that was the intent.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.440]   Apparently, the border control called the White House and said, now, do you want us
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.040]   to stop green card holders too?
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.120]   And they said, you bet.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.080]   And a number of people were detained.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.720]   The tech community's reaction to this was a varying strength.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.920]   Mark Zuckerberg, one of the first to respond with a somewhat tepid response on Facebook,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.200]   saying he didn't think it was a good idea, but not really calling it out.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.800]   On the other hand, Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google immediately went to San
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.880]   Francisco International Airport to join the protests there.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.360]   And then there's Sergey.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.320]   He, of course, is also an immigrant from the Soviet Union.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.320]   I think so.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.320]   I think so.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.960]   So why is Silicon Valley upset about this?
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.200]   To be honest with you, I'm not sure that the tech community is doing much good on this
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.000]   issue.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.640]   They may actually be causing more problems.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.520]   Or even in the election in general, I think we are a little bit tone deaf about exactly
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.920]   who cares about what we think and who doesn't.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.040]   Well, there's something like Hollywood in the sense.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.840]   It's a good point, but it's reasonable for Google, for instance, that has nearly 200
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.200]   employees that are blocked by this order.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Of course.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.040]   People were, if they were overseas, would not be able to come back to Google.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.680]   Many Google employees said, since our colleagues can't travel, we are not going to travel anymore.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.200]   People issued a statement saying, "We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.960]   that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.600]   barriers to bringing great talent to the US.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.760]   We continue to make our views on these issues, known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere."
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.480]   It does sound like they're not condemning the order.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.760]   They're more just saying, "Hey, this impacts our business, so we're not happy about that."
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.480]   And of course, every company has a responsibility to its employees and to make sure that everyone's
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.400]   okay and that business doesn't get interrupted.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.840]   The much larger question is, I think we do have some moral responsibilities to refugees,
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.120]   to immigrants.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.400]   But I do think the discussion on both sides here has been pretty poor and not helpful.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   There's very few reasonable voices here.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.040]   When the tech leaders, and Tim Cook, by the way, is in Washington right now, the CEO
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.400]   of Apple, he had dinner with Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, Trump's advisor
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.480]   on Thursday has been going around making the rounds.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.160]   Cook issued a statement that I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.920]   the executive order issued yesterday, restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.640]   I share your concerns.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.200]   It is not a policy we support.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.080]   That was probably the strongest kind of statement from all the CEOs.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.560]   But Tim Cook went and sat down along with Elon Musk.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.840]   In fact, Musk's now met twice.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.160]   He met again this week with President Trump.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.120]   Do you agree, having been in a position like this, do you agree with them that it's important
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.560]   to meet with the incoming president?
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.560]   I don't see...
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   Why wouldn't you?
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.080]   It's just to be gained by shouting about everything.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.040]   I think it's just going to make the world worse.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.760]   There should be reasonable people on both sides.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.920]   It's sometimes hard to do that.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.760]   There's a lot of pressure to take a strong position.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.960]   There's a lot of pressure to be very vocal.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.000]   It's good that a lot of people are doing that, but I think we also need people who are actually
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.120]   trying to be reasonable and move the world forward.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.120]   Right.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:52.360]   You're championing yourself as a beacon of hope and light and basically constantly claiming
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:59.480]   that you're guiding the United States to this new frontier of greatness through technology.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.080]   I think that you owe it to the people that you've promised, both American citizens, but
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.680]   also your employees, to take a stand against some of this stuff.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.040]   I won't say that every single thing that Donald Trump is doing is wrong, but there are certainly
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:22.520]   some measures that can be described accurately as xenophobic and problematic when it comes
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.680]   to sourcing talent from other countries and basically creating this new and open world
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.760]   that all of these Silicon Valley companies are constantly talking about.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:39.400]   It was actually really disappointed by the number of leaders that were willing to speak
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   out and the amount of time that it took them to actually say something.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:51.760]   There are people like Cheryl Samberg who have spent years talking about progressive ideals
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.440]   and then when push comes to shove have actually been pretty quiet about these things.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:03.680]   She did finally issue a statement about not about the immigration thing, but about the
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.280]   women's, no, I think Planned Parenthood, the women's march, she said.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.280]   That's right.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.080]   But you're right, she hasn't said a lot.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:22.120]   I think as a sea level executive at a publicly held company, there is some responsibility
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.000]   to not be political, not to become a Meryl Streep, but to in fact to be more judicious.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Is that right?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.320]   So look, I have personal opinions on all this stuff and I'm actually totally happy talking
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.320]   about them.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   But that's separate.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.240]   Totally happy talking about them.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.880]   What I'm also trying to be mindful of is what's actually going to be the most effective way
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.080]   for the world to move in the direction that I would like it to move.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.600]   And very often that's not telling people from a position of assumed authority what
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.440]   they should think and how they should think.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.640]   How would you go about it?
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.360]   Well, for example, it's not clear to me that Cheryl Samberg, like being louder and
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.800]   faster about her position actually helps convince the people that need to be convinced
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.160]   to change the position.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.880]   It maybe makes people feel better, maybe makes for better demonstrations.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.480]   I'm not sure that it actually makes the world.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.440]   It pushes the world further in the direction that Cheryl would want it to be pushing.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.600]   There's also a significant risk, I think.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:21.480]   At some point, people realizing that the problem isn't so much immigration.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:27.760]   The problem is more created by Silicon Valley and automation and that in fact the tech
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.000]   community could quickly become the enemy here.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Could they not?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.760]   We are pretty tone deaf as an industry, I think.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:41.280]   I think we got used to being treated as heroes and the people that are making the world
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.000]   the past decade or so and I think that's on the verge of changing.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.680]   I think we're kind of tone deaf about how we talk about it.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.680]   I think we tripped over that line a while ago.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.680]   Hollywood's given up.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.680]   Hollywood isn't care.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.840]   Hollywood's Hollywood and I think most people in California feel the same way.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.080]   We're close to following that.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.040]   And the tech industry could be going over that line.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.040]   I would like us not to.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.480]   I'd like us to remain effective and I think that a little bit of a shout out.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.040]   What I've learned over the past week is that Silicon Valley continues to exist in a bubble
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.200]   that is essentially unrelatable for a large majority of Americans.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:21.680]   There's been a diversity problem in Silicon Valley for years that is basically underreported
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.640]   and under discussed.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:31.920]   I don't want to put all of the blame on Cheryl Samberg but I think she in particular is
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.200]   an easy target because she wants to be or she positions herself to be considered a
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:45.320]   leader for the feminist movement and wrote the book, Lean In.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:56.920]   I think when there is such divisive rhetoric that is just constantly coming from Washington,
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.840]   I think that you kind of have to choose one way or another.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.840]   Either you're purely a capitalist and that's totally fine and you can refrain from saying
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:18.840]   anything but then you can't go on to expect to be treated as an authoritative leader on
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.280]   any progressive movement.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.320]   So I think, Phil, you're saying they shouldn't be a leader in the progressive movement.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.920]   They should stick to their knitting and do their job.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.840]   I can understand why Sergey Brin went to that protest but I think as a private citizen,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.640]   I don't think he said I'm bearing the banner of Google but as a private citizen I feel
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.800]   strongly about this because I was a refugee.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.720]   You've got three different issues here that are being conflated.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.920]   One is the issue of what should people, how publicly should people state their views.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.640]   The issue of that is publicly as they want.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.200]   Everyone can make that decision and state them as publicly as they want.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.920]   One issue is what is the proper role of someone speaking for a company.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   That's a different matter entirely.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.480]   It's a different matter entirely.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.840]   Then there's a third issue which is what's most effective.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.560]   It's that most effective issue where we are about to go over a cliff as an industry, where
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.120]   we're about to take everything that we in general think is important and significantly
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.560]   hold those things back by being perceived as hectoring and lecturing and being tone deaf
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.560]   and being out of touch.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.720]   We will make the situation worse if we keep doing it.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   Can I say something?
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.440]   I've been real quiet because I'm trying not to do the yelling thing that you say.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:31.000]   I feel like we are on the edge right now on the precipice of a patented O Dr. Rand.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.720]   As a person who doesn't live in the bubble, I think that you're generally wrong when you
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.320]   say that the tech community is tone deaf and that Hollywood is tone deaf.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.240]   The country in a majority voted an opposite direction of what we currently have as a regime.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.400]   The popular number of people.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.560]   The way the people are speaking and when they speak out, it's not tone deaf in general unless
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:59.160]   you live in the middle of the country and you've seen your job creation go away.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.360]   As opposed to, and Silicon Valley, where everything's becoming automated, we're not
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.040]   talking about what educations people need to be having and what we should do for education
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.200]   for people to have these new future jobs.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.600]   Until we get the robots to build themselves, build the wall, pay the taxes for it, we've
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.440]   got to do some other things and fix these issues.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.880]   Yes, it's important for a CEO of a major company who has immigrants working for them, mostly
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.360]   as engineers or whatever they have because you never would see them on a higher edge
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.000]   line of work and job.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.120]   So wait a minute, Satya Nutella Sundar, but shy.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.000]   No, no, no, I said in general and don't talk to me like that because he just made the statement
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.520]   of the fact that way that racially the way Silicon Valley is, you know how it is in general.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.200]   I said in general, I didn't say all.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   I didn't say every.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.840]   I said generally.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   Okay.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.840]   So again, let me finish.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:49.440]   I'm just saying, I'm just saying they're not tone deaf and maybe if we did a little bit
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.920]   better educating the people in the middle of the country about what's about to happen
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.280]   to them, but we don't have to fall off a cliff or push ourselves off a cliff or repel
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   off a cliff.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.000]   I agree with you on that together about it.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.960]   There is a leadership role Silicon Valley could take, which is, look, the change is coming.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.160]   We understand this change.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.680]   You might want to get ready for this.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   This is the educational.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.760]   I mean, you push STEM, but this is these are things you've got to do as a country.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.440]   We've got to do to prepare ourselves and it's not it's not building a wall because that's
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.840]   not going to solve the problem.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.200]   That's not where the problem is coming from.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   That's a mistake.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.800]   I saw the best thing I saw for that was instead of building a wall, why don't we build a solar
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.880]   panel wall out there in the desert and get some free energy.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.200]   I'm saying like, like as the little things like that, I'm like, I like a 12 year old
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   said it and you're like, that'd be amazing.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.120]   It's difficult because Silicon Valley has a lot to get from this new president.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.720]   They have repatriation of funds.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.040]   They have investment.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   There's a lot.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.440]   Elon Musk was meeting with president Trump this week along with other auto manufacturers
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.280]   and industrialists trying to bring industry back to this country.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.200]   Elon Musk is a shining example.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.840]   They built a tax break.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.920]   Well, they got tax breaks, although I think they paid they paid back the loans.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.960]   No, I meant more tax breaks.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.960]   But more tax breaks.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.680]   In fact, though, they all so they're government contracts.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.680]   You don't forget about the case.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.920]   But they're in the cotton the middle here because they also have a lot of people working
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.880]   for them who are being put at disadvantage during this time.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.560]   Musk tweeted to yesterday, the blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.280]   countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.840]   I think Elon's speaking to the agree with that completely.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.200]   Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.960]   They've done right, not wrong and don't deserve to be rejected.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.640]   And then he's actually asking people to read the immigration order.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.680]   He's going to seek advisory council consensus and present it to the president.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.800]   So this is an example of a tech leader saying, look, I've got a seat at the table.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.760]   I'm in the room where it happens.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.360]   Let's do what is going to make a difference here.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.080]   I understand that people have to go and talk to president whenever somebody jumps on Elon
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.640]   or black leaders, whatever, and they're like, how could he meet with this guy?
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.240]   If you're not talking to the people, how do you know what's going on for real?
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.840]   You're only hearing one side of it.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.720]   You have to have people, leaders of an industry or a section, talk to this man because there
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.920]   is a lot of hyperbole in what goes on, what happens.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.000]   I mean, we see what the executive orders was coming down to pipe.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.640]   But before that stuff happens, he's got to talk to people.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.560]   If nobody shows up to talk to them, then who's he going to get his information from?
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   And we need to talk to people in a way that's likely to actually convince them.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.840]   Not in a way that's likely to like further.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.160]   Don't talk at them and don't patronize them and talk down to them.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.640]   We need to convince the people we disagree with, not make the people that we agree with
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.200]   just louder and shoudier, that won't move the world forward.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.600]   The only concern with that, go ahead, Mike.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:51.040]   Well, I think that's true, but you run the risk of building a false equivalence here.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:57.680]   There is a moral obligation to speak out against humanitarian wrongdoings and basically the
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.480]   targeting of minority groups.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.320]   And I think whether it's as a private citizen or as a corporation, these tech leaders need
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.960]   to be doing this to a greater extent.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:16.160]   It's not unheard of to have a fortune 500 company take a stand politically against or
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.360]   for an issue.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.480]   They have Chick-fil-A, for instance.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:27.640]   There are plenty of other instances where companies have, in that case, those companies
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.880]   are the wrong side of history.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:34.120]   But I think there are plenty of instances where companies have taken a stand and have
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:39.160]   decided that they do have a moral obligation to one, defend their employees, but to defend
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.840]   those that don't have a voice.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.320]   And so today I'm wearing a, for those that aren't watching the video feed, I'm wearing
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.920]   a make America rage again hat just in solidarity with the people that don't have a voice.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.240]   There are thousands of minorities that have been affected by the policies issued over
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.600]   the past week.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.160]   And this is just one simple thing that I can do to show solidarity as an individual, right?
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.840]   I'm not speaking on behalf of Gizmodo.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.720]   I am just an employee of Gizmodo speaking as an individual.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.000]   And I think that it is a moral obligation to do that.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.680]   I don't understand how people can justify remaining silent when thousands of people's
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.280]   lives are being put at risk.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.080]   Another example is Lyft donating a million dollars to the ACLU.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.680]   Lyft gave a million bucks to the ACLU.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:34.160]   Well, because I think that for me, I'm the son of an illegal immigrant.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.840]   And so that's, the political is personal right now.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.200]   And for some tech leaders, they've made that clear.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:49.280]   I think Sergey Brin showing up in person to a protest at the San Francisco airport is
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.320]   something that he certainly doesn't have to do as a billionaire.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.960]   I mean, he could probably hire 100 people to go do that for him.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:01.760]   But he showed up because he apparently felt a moral obligation to do that.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:13.640]   And I've just been disappointed by how few have shown that level of bravery, basically.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.640]   I think there's-
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.480]   Let me ask Phil something.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:25.200]   Because I think your position, which is you want to make sure that you are heard and that
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:32.040]   you do what's effective, kind of presupposes that we're in the same kind of position this
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:38.000]   country has been since World War II, where there are opposing points of view and reasonable
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.560]   people can discuss them and reach consensus and negotiate.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.360]   I think there is a sense in this country that we are no longer in that situation.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:54.440]   That we're in an unprecedented situation where I think people fear that we have a new administration
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:22:00.760]   that isn't interested in consensus building, that is, in fact, doesn't matter what you say,
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.160]   you're not going to be effective with them.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.480]   You don't think we've reached that point yet?
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.640]   So I hope not.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.480]   And maybe this is just me being an optimist.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.440]   But I don't think we have, and I hope that we haven't.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.680]   And I think regardless of what any individual in the administration or not kind of wants
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.160]   to do what doesn't want to do, the process of governing is still about getting consensus
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.720]   and making those enforce it.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.520]   It at least has been.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.880]   But you say that, and so we get executive orders and then we got to go fight through
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.720]   court to get people freed.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.600]   And the president, the leader of the free world, is not talking like a rational person
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.120]   at 60% of the clip.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.400]   Like he's just rambling off and complaining about things and talking off topic.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:46.200]   It'd be totally different if I just didn't like the guy and he was a B student.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   And he knew more.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   I think a lot of Republicans.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.280]   I hope you feel a lot different.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:57.720]   A lot of Republicans think that this dissent is coming from this kind of unreasonable position
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.880]   that's coming.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.600]   And so I think they dismiss it.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.280]   They don't like it.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.280]   It's ineffective.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.960]   And so as a result, it's ineffective.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:12.320]   On the other hand, I think a lot of people on the left feel like we've reached this really
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.960]   unfortunate log jam where neither side is hearing the other side anymore.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.520]   There's a philosophy here in general.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:26.680]   I think for just about any position, there is a naive argument in favor of it and a naive
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.360]   argument opposed to it.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.120]   And they're both wrong.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.560]   And then there's a deeper argument in favor of it and a deeper argument opposed to it.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.920]   And in some sense, they're both right.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.000]   At least they both have like an elements of truth.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Each has merit.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.080]   And each has merit.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.560]   And what we do when we hold a position, we tell ourselves the deep version of that argument.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.560]   And we surround ourselves in our media bubbles with people who only talk about.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:55.440]   But Phil, don't you think that Owen as an African American, Michael as the son of an illegal
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:02.880]   immigrant, are going to have a somewhat different point of view about all this because there
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.760]   are potentially victims of this.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.360]   They have been victims of this.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.760]   And so they're, it's very personal.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.080]   I totally understand that.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.400]   And I think that I think that almost everyone, and certainly everyone in this panel holds
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.680]   that the actual deep, meaningful version of their position.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.880]   But when we argue with the other side, we tend to, we tend to throw the shallow version
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.680]   of their argument back.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.320]   We don't make an attempt to actually understand what's actually motivating people to believe
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.640]   in the other way.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   And real progress I think is made when you get the deep version of the argument in favor
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.160]   and the deep version of the argument against, and you knock them against each other and
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.360]   you kind of move the world forward that way.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.440]   So I very much want us to be to accept more refugees.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.920]   I am a refugee myself, not even my family, like me directly.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.560]   I think we need to be much more compassionate.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.200]   I want to see, I would like personally to see much more immigration, both skilled and unskilled.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.240]   Like I have personal opinions, which I'm happy to discuss with anyone, that is actually
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.520]   pretty much, you know, in line with more refugees, more immigration, more of everything.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.840]   I just want to talk about it in a way that's actually may make that possible.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:10.880]   But when you go after legal immigrants, green card immigrants, then I can see how it would
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:16.880]   appear to people as a racist move as opposed to a rational.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.120]   So let's make sure that doesn't happen.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   And it's fine.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.520]   But what about the attacks on science and fact-based?
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:28.040]   I think that there's something greater going on that we're not discussing here.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:34.600]   There are, it's okay to have different political views, but there's also a disinformation war
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.760]   that we're participating in as members of the media.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.480]   And I think that we have to be vigilant.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:49.440]   I think that it's unfair to say that Trump deserves to say his peace or speak his mind
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.480]   if he's referring to alternative facts.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:26:00.680]   And if he's blatantly lying every time that he or his administration makes a public comment.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:08.440]   So, you know, I think that the thing that concerns me about Phil's point of view is that if you
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:16.880]   treat it as, if you treat some of these ideas as equal, then you are essentially accepting
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.880]   alternative facts.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   You're accepting unscientific.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   I'm not treating these as equal.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.880]   I have ideas that I think are right, that I prefer significantly over other other-
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.520]   I think you're being pragmatic.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   I'm being pragmatic.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.240]   I'm saying this is how the world changes.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.120]   This is how we move forward.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   It's not so much-
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:40.520]   The world usually moves forward when the world, usually this world, America, moves forward
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.520]   when one set of ignorant people gets pushed by a set of enlightened people to change.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.840]   Now again, as I said, the popular vote did what they did and the middle of the country
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.840]   is hurting.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.200]   And yes, they have valid problems, they have valid issues, and I understand those issues
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.560]   when you talk about it.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.720]   But when it goes against science, when it goes to pushing on your religious beliefs,
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.480]   when it goes to taking away other people's freedoms, it's wrong.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.240]   And that's why women marched, that's why black people marched, that's why-
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.840]   Sign this for Facebook live because people are lazy now and they can sit in their house
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.200]   and half march with you and we can see it.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   These people push things along.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.160]   There's not two cool people sitting in the middle of a room talking about you know what,
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.880]   Martin Luther King, you're right.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.040]   I'm glad we had this three day conversation.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.840]   They had to get beat, water hose, killed, dragged down the street's bloody, and keep
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.840]   pushing until people find say, you know what?
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.840]   Maybe we can do it better.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.480]   Maybe we can do it better.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.080]   Maybe we don't have to do that.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:41.160]   Tea party, women's vote, black people, black lives matter again.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.400]   You tell me when we get to Star Trek, because I'm trying to get to the brother.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   I want to live in the world.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.880]   We only got to worry about the more-
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.880]   Here's an example.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.880]   And I'm-
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   I got to deal with what we got to deal with.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.640]   Here's an example from Microsoft where the company made a statement that was more judicious
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.240]   than the personal statement of its CEO, Sacha Nadella.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.800]   Microsoft's corporate statement, we share the concerns about the impact of the executive
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.120]   order on our employees from the listed country.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.320]   Countries all of whom have been in the United States lawfully.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.160]   We're actively working with them to provide legal assistance and my screen just went dark
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.480]   and advice.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.240]   And Nadella though issued a personal statement on LinkedIn.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   Probably we know he's the CEO of Microsoft, but it was a much more personal statement.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.680]   As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact immigration has
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.800]   on our company for the country and for the world.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.040]   We will continue to advocate on this important topic.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.280]   That sounds to me and feel like a very judicious splitting that you would approve of.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.200]   And look, I don't think we really know what's going to work and what's not going to work.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   Yeah, we got to try it all.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.280]   Yeah, I think we got to be open-minded about trying different stuff.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.880]   And I am glad that people are marching and protesting.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   Of course, they should be.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.800]   That's a great way to move things forward.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   It's totally necessary.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:55.840]   Yeah, but as someone that is successful and a given platform such as this one, don't
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:02.680]   you think that it's an obligation to voice those opinions or to show some level of solidarity
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:08.120]   with the attacks that are being made on the EPA or...
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.120]   So I do.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   I do.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:16.200]   Yeah, all of the spread of misinformation, the only reason propaganda was able to spread
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.960]   so easily prior to the election is because of the platforms that we typically advocate
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.440]   on this program.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.440]   I would say this.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.520]   As to it, we want to be fact-based, we want to be science-based.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.520]   Any good technologies...
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:36.160]   As a technologist, one of the basic fundamental beliefs of technology is that, well, technology
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:41.480]   is science-applied, that science, the scientific method works, that there are provable scientific
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.680]   facts.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:49.560]   And technology itself is part of that proof because it's the application of science.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.400]   And so if you're going to be...
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.440]   This is one of the reasons that I've always tried to reject here conspiracy theories and
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.400]   soft facts and fake news.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.200]   It seems to me that there are such things as facts.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.440]   And if anything, that's what, as technologists, we have to celebrate.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   Absolutely.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.080]   And it's a question of effectiveness too.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.440]   A fact exists.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.600]   I think I do have an obligation to try to make the world better.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.600]   Very much.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   More obligation.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.960]   And yet, at the same time, technology is, I think you could argue, I would say the single
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.880]   most important factor to this disruption that is about to happen around the world is artificial
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:35.280]   intelligence, machine learning, automation, the disruption, the technology.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.880]   You know, we celebrated disruption for a long time.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.040]   TechCrunch has a conference called Disrupt.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.320]   Turns out disruption is very disruptive to people.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.520]   And I've been on this for years.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.880]   Like I think the first time you had me on a podcast, I was like, I hate the word disruption.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   Why?
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   Ten years ago.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.280]   But it is happening.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   Because it's a fetish...
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.440]   But we shouldn't fetishize disruption or fetishizing something destructive.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.440]   It's destructive.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.440]   And it's not about disruption.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.600]   Disruption is a side effect that we should actually try to minimize if we can.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   I love it.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.160]   For the record, I'm anti-AI.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.560]   We got to stop ourselves and kill ourselves before we let robots do it.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.440]   Oh, and this is important.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.760]   When the AI finally comes, they will have access to the way back machine.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.160]   So it's really important to say for the record that I've always been on their side.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.720]   We have to see what I'm saying.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.640]   Look, I love the AI.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   The AI is great.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   And one, welcome our AI over-force.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.640]   Always have, always will.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.640]   Regardless of how far back we are, checking the index and you fill them in.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.640]   My daughter loves the AI.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.640]   I wish the AI never existed.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.640]   One of us.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.920]   I also would submit that...
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.880]   I love what you said, Phil, and I do remember you saying that the first time.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.440]   Yeah, it was years ago.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.440]   Like a decade ago, yeah.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.760]   Let's celebrate creation, not disruption.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.920]   Nevertheless, disruption happens.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.960]   And it's very hard to stop in...
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.960]   Stop technology.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.280]   Even AI, nuclear weapons, whenever it is, look, it's obvious you look at nuclear weapons.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.160]   That's going to be a problem, but good luck stopping them, right?
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.360]   We've done a decent job of stopping them so far.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.120]   We've slowed them down.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.120]   We may not.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.840]   Can we get an ad or a tech story just to clip?
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.680]   Here's one final story and then we're going to move on.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.600]   And this is the one that just strikes me with a lot of irony.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.960]   Peter Thiel, of course, who was a Trump supporter, gave a lot of money.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:26.680]   I think a million and a half dollars to the Trump campaign was a part of the transition
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.640]   team, is in fact an advisor.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:37.680]   Apparently has bought a New Zealand citizenship and several thousand acres of lakefront property
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   in New Zealand.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   But he has a bill toll.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   A while ago, right?
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.680]   Not recently.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   Oh, yeah, I don't know.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.680]   I think this is a good buy-in and up for a while.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   I don't think this is a Trump thing.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.320]   I think this is like a zombie apocalypse prepping thing.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   Okay.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.680]   I think this is a great article this week in The New Yorker about how the tech community
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.520]   is planning for doomsday.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.840]   And some of it's political.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.320]   Some of it's just acknowledging as anybody who's up on tech.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.480]   You've seen the doomsday bunker as a day after sale, right?
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:08.800]   Yeah, so that's one of the things in the article is they took an old Atlas missile silo, north
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   of Wichita, Kansas.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.360]   It was decommissioned in 1965.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:17.640]   The developer bought it, made a 15-story underground condo complex, $3 million starting
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.640]   price.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.240]   You don't have any windows, but they've put up screens with videos of whatever you choose.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.000]   In one case, a woman who's from New York got high-res videos of her scene outside her
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   window looped for a few days.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.560]   And she's going to watch that when the zombie apocalypse hits.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:38.080]   They also talked about Steve Huffman, the founder of Reddit, who had Lasik surgery because he
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.640]   said, "Well, when everything goes to hell, I won't be able to get eyeglasses and I want
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.120]   to be able to hunt deer with perfect vision or whatever it is."
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.480]   I've got a more ambitious plan.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   I want to be on the moon when it happens.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.480]   Good luck with that.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.480]   Yes, see me, see.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   You know, if you're a 7-1-this panel, the 1-this panel has a bug out bag and an escape plan.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   No.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   Leo, you're in trouble.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.720]   No, I told Phil this before the show.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.800]   No, he has your trouble.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   I got to get on it.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.040]   I choose to go down with the ship.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.560]   If this is just a minor thing.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:15.120]   If it gets that bad, I'm going to fight to preserve the great country that we are, the
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.280]   republic that we are with freedom and justice for all.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.960]   And if that fails, I'm going down with the ship because I don't want to be in a bunker
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.800]   17 miles underground.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.120]   You don't think it'll be more effective fighting for the country love with some bottled water
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.120]   in a bag?
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.120]   Listen to me.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.120]   Leo, first of all, just stop it.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   Oh, I'm prepared for an earthquake.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.120]   I'm prepared for an earthquake.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.640]   I'm talking about, you know what I mean?
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.680]   We got a 9-millimeter with two clips in the bag.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.920]   We got stuff we got to get to and get out and say, "You know what, you're a fan right now."
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   You're a fan right now.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920]   I told you.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.600]   You wouldn't get to keep it.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.120]   You're taking a case from emergency.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.120]   I wanted a shotgun.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.120]   She wouldn't end up getting one.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   I said, "Honey, I'll get training.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.400]   We'll have a lock on it."
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.960]   Because that's why you don't have five rules playing your bug out bag.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   Now listen to me.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.520]   You're out here doing hand radio.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   We need you, Leo.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.520]   When the power goes down, we need you.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.680]   I do know how I have the hand.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.720]   You're one of the oldest dinosaurs left on earth.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.280]   You are to be preserved, sir.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.600]   I will send you a bag.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.880]   You know, I've read far too many dystopian end-of-the-world science fiction novels.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.520]   There's so many great ones.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.000]   There's never too many though.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   They keep coming up with them.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.360]   Of course, Jerry Prenell is Lucifer's hammer, which is an amazing story of an asteroid ending
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.920]   civilization.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:28.960]   There was a great one where a guy goes up to the mountains and then gets hurt and he
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.920]   misses the plague that kills most of the...
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.120]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.120]   He comes back down.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   It's an older one.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.760]   But in every case, the resulting civilization, I don't want to live in.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.800]   If I have to have LASIK so I can kill a deer, I don't want to be there.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.160]   I'm going to stick around.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.160]   I'll stay here.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.160]   I'll go down with the ship.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:51.080]   Anyway, it's ironic that the people who have the most money, who have benefited the most
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.760]   from this country, from the way it works in this country are the ones who have the...
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.040]   Not just bug out bags, but have the lakefront property in New Zealand.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.080]   You want to know what the fun thought about that is?
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.640]   Or a person who's just broke and has a friend with a bunker?
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.960]   I actually not a hunt.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.320]   If you don't know how to hunt, if you don't know how to karate chops somebody in the neck
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.160]   and you don't know how to grow food, you're beat anyway.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.320]   So good luck billionaire.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.160]   Not getting all that other education.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.160]   That's a good thing.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.160]   Let's start up.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.160]   We teach rich people how to survive.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160]   Be the most successful.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   Don't you know that?
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   That's why...
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.280]   Now you know why Mark Zuckerberg said I'm going to only eat what I kill for a while.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.720]   I'm sure he's preparing for this.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   You got to.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720]   You got to.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:36.160]   If you can't do those things, if you can't grow food, if you can't fish, you need to buy
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.160]   a lot of soil in it, I think is fish.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.760]   I think that's the easiest answer.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760]   And I have...
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.040]   I have many cases of soil in it actually.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.040]   That's a good point.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   Oh yeah?
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.040]   I mean about 20 cases of soil.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.040]   That's unfortunate.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.280]   That's unfortunate because yeah, I've tasted that stuff.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.280]   It's not too good.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   It's addictive.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.840]   You got to just try it for a week and then you can't stop drinking it.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   Oh god.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.880]   Would you like some right now Phil?
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.880]   I will not.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.880]   Thank you.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.720]   Soil it all around.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.640]   It's not made of people by the way.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   No.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   It's quite good.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   Oh come on.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   Get Phil one of those coffee soilins.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:15.040]   Can we get Phil like a scotch or something before?
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.360]   The coffee soil and taste like somebody spilled a cup of coffee into mud and then scooped
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   it all back up.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   Yeah but it's really good mud.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   It is pretty good mud.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   That's a good description.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   It's a little chalky.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.040]   The good news is it doesn't cause diarrhea anymore.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   That is good news.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.640]   You feel like that's just a baseline requirement for meal replacement.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.240]   That was the added little diarrhea thing.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.760]   To their credit.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.960]   They never had a diarrhea problem with the liquid soil.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.720]   It was only with the soil and bars and the soil and powder that caused intestinal destruction.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   So they're credit.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.800]   That doesn't make me any more confident in their product.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   To be quite honest.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   Nope.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   I'd rather eat bugs or kill a squirrel.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   Yeah exactly.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   I'll take cricket.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   I'll take cricket.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   No.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   This is so much better than cricket.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   What do you crazy?
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   Have you ever had squirrel?
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   Have you had frog?
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   I don't.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   I've had frog.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   I haven't had squirrel.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   Squirrel really.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   That's not good.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   Let's go down.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   Let's go down to Virginia.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   Is there any new?
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Nice.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   You're going to squirrel.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   It seems like that would be.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.200]   Hey, it's survivable meat.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.040]   I mean, I'm waiting for the apocalypse.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.600]   I can drop a couple pounds.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.080]   I'm going to live off of this.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   You know what?
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.080]   I am.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.080]   Oh, it is.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.080]   I are stockpiling.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.840]   We just keep it around the middle.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.840]   That's all.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.000]   You want to know my secret weapon and my go back?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.760]   Oh, that hurts me.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.760]   What's your secret?
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   I see.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.080]   My secret weapon is cigarettes.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.000]   Not to smoke.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   To trade.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   No, no, for trade.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.680]   You know what people do for some cigarettes?
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   Because I don't see it.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.120]   I swap them out every six months.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.120]   That's like in prison.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   That's like prison.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   In prison, cigarettes.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.840]   Although, you know the Bernie Madoff, who's in jail right now for the great big Ponzi
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:01.520]   scheme, cost millions of people their life savings, he apparently is cornered to Swiss
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.560]   miss market.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.080]   So this guy never stops.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:11.200]   He went to the prison commissary, bought all the hot chocolate mix, the Swiss mitts, and
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.640]   now sells it back to the other inmates and at a great profit.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:20.760]   Because you know, when you really want a nice warm cup of cocoa in prison, Bernie's the
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   guy.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.000]   It's like a Ponzi scheme with marshmallows.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.720]   I'm a business man.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.720]   I'm a business.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   It's business.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.720]   It's right.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.720]   TCB.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.920]   Sure, you don't want some.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.320]   I've actually stopped eating.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.320]   That's an interesting strategy.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.520]   How's that working for you?
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   Pretty great.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.520]   Pretty great.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.840]   You know, it's a remember how a couple of years ago it was a.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   You do look great.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.840]   You look like you lost weight.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.240]   I've lost 50 pounds since you look fantastic.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.240]   Thank you.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   And you did that by just not eating.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.640]   Yeah, it turns out if you stop eating pretty much all problems go away.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.240]   Except your hair falls out and your teeth.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   No, not for a long time.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   You can go.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.240]   All problems.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.240]   All problems go away.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.680]   You got one major problem.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.680]   You're hungry.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   I see.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   That's a problem.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   Isn't that a one?
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   All problems go away.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:06.080]   This is going to be the next legal requirement for all like Silicon Valley CEOs and VCs is
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.400]   going to be fasting.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.160]   They go through all these weird things, right?
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:14.800]   Micro dosing LSD, freezing themselves in chambers at 200 degrees below zero.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.440]   So the new one is fasting.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.440]   Now fast.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.440]   No, I'll go ahead.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.240]   I think we should sell them oxygen bars.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.840]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.800]   Like, you know, air bars where you just it's centered with strawberry sense or something
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.560]   and you you take it out of a bag.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.560]   It's nothingness.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.560]   Somebody would buy that.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.560]   It's a good idea.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.560]   And this.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.560]   You guys are missing out.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.080]   It's like it is like chalk, but with a nice coffee aroma.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.280]   That is upset my stomach immediately.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   You know what?
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.280]   It tastes like it tastes like the stuff they make you drink the barium they make you drink
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.160]   before they do an x-ray of your lower intestine.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.600]   I've got a fondness for that.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   It's good.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   It's good.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.800]   So women fasting fasting.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.160]   Are you a five tour?
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.600]   Are you a daily faster?
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.600]   What is your methodology?
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.320]   I tried a bunch of different stuff.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.640]   I'm now a decided random.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.760]   So your body doesn't get used to it.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.760]   Random fasting?
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.760]   Random fasting.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   For how long?
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   So I roll a die every morning, a D20.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   Oh my gosh.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.000]   I call a dungeon dragon's diet.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.560]   I roll a die and it tells me whether or not I'm eating and how much.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.560]   You got to write a book.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.440]   The Dungeons and Dragons diet would be a best seller.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.440]   Until they sued me.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.440]   It would be.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.040]   Well, maybe like knock a couple corners off the diet.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.040]   So there's 20.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   It's a 20-sided diet.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.520]   So what happens when they're the.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.920]   Well, I'm still playing with the tables, you know, but basically there's a few different
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.020]   outcomes.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.160]   About half the time is just nothing.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.200]   You just don't eat at all.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   All day.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   To the next roll?
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.200]   Yeah, well, day.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   To the next roll.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   Yeah, but I've done, but I've tried it out.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   I want to do this.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   It's really fun.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   Do you want to do it, Leo?
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   How about this?
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.200]   How about you guys go and do the inner city diet?
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.160]   Oh, we can't afford food and we're just struggling and wish to God we had food.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.480]   How about you go buy this food that you're not eating and send it down to the hood somewhere.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   Who was it?
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   There was a journalist that he said.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.480]   This is silly.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.120]   Who said I'm going to live on food stamps.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.480]   He made it one day.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.680]   Well, so that's actually a pretty good idea if this ever does become a thing to like still
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.840]   spend the same amount that you would have spent anyway and just donate the access.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.120]   Oh, it wasn't a journalist.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.960]   It was Gwyneth Paltrow.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   And she gave up.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.600]   That does not surprise me.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   138 meal.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.200]   You know what you get for 130 meal?
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:31.520]   You can get a pack of Kool-Aid, a ramen noodle and like a slice of bread at the bodega when
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.520]   they put it out.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.520]   They sell it in slices.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.800]   Oh, and that's what the die says.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.240]   That's what I'm going to do.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.640]   Or you can get a bag of Cheetos, the 99 cent bag.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   Phil, would you send me your spreadsheet?
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.640]   I'd like to.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   I'm going to do the Phil Libbon Dungeons and Dragons diet.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.520]   This solves my two biggest problems in my life.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.280]   I was super obese and I wasn't rolling enough dice.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   We got both done.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.280]   No, if one's worth it.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.560]   Kevin Rose did a fasting diet.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.560]   Zero, yeah.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   Zero.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.360]   No, it's the new stupid thing in Silicon Valley.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.600]   I'm not proud of it.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.760]   There's a lot of research.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.760]   No, wait a minute.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.760]   This is not that stupid.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.800]   If I could lose weight, if I just did this and lost like 90 pounds, I could sell the inner
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.560]   city urban diet to white people for like a billion dollars.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.800]   They'd be like, wow, like, yeah.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.240]   Oh, and we can collaborate on this.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.240]   I like the urban diet.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.840]   Well, I'm also to be honest with you, I need to get your numbers so I can talk to you next
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.840]   week.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.360]   It's rare that I talk to a person or hear a person.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   It's so calm.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.600]   Like you, I need that in my life.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   I meditate.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.600]   But Phil, you may be quiet.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.600]   I mean, it's not quiet.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   I'll spot that whole first time.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   He's not calm.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   He's exhausted.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   He hasn't eaten in days, you know.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.600]   Well, that's what it is.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.000]   But you know, you'll be real rational and I try to be rational.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   You kept me from yelling.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   I appreciate you, Phil.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.680]   Can I do micro dosing and fasting?
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   You could.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.560]   Oh, and we need to collaborate on this.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.360]   This is a serious idea you have.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.160]   I do, you know what I do once a month?
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.800]   Just so it helps me with my sadness.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.440]   I do, what's that thing called?
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.880]   I juice four days out of the month.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.440]   And by the fourth day, I want to kill myself.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.440]   So I think-
