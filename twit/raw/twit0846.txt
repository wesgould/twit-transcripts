[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.640]   bumpy ride. Oh, doctor is in the house. Oh, and JJ Stone apparently somewhat of an
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.040]   Eagles fan. Somewhat. And last Sunday, lucky I wasn't on shows my birthday and I
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.280]   just want to introduce everybody to it. What you get? It's got an L. One of those
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.400]   L. Red rings around it. It is the 50 millimeter RF lens. It's so beautiful. It
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   is like I just I mean I love a lot of things. I mean I have a child and I have
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.360]   like last now. Oh, it's expensive actually. This thing right here. Oh, oh, you could
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.520]   send that to you could send a kid to college for that. What is the she's not
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.640]   going to cost. She ain't gonna make it out of but about a 100 to 500 this year. I
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.960]   got the holy trinity and I mean I can't afford college anymore. Is that for an
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.640]   R5? Is that for the mirrorless or is that for it? It is. It is. I'm using R5 as
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.400]   my webcam and I've seen it 35 because people always ask what kind of camera
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.920]   I'm using. It's good depth of field. It's such a good field that the lens was out
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.480]   of focus while you weren't. Oh yeah. Yeah. I was I was going to use this but it
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.440]   looks so real. I got scared not to go back to. I don't think you need to count my
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.920]   eyes. I really should be. I really want to know. I'm set jealous. You bought too
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.000]   much Apple stuff. You can't afford it. I know it's right. I broke. Also with
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.440]   his hot and he's gonna we're gonna talk a little bit about that Apple stuff. Lou
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.120]   Maresca who happens to work for Microsoft but he's also the host of this
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.840]   weekend enterprise tech. Hello Lou. Hey Leo. Thanks for having me on. You moved to my
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.880]   my old stomping grounds. You moved back East. You like it. I didn't move to
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.440]   Rhode Island. I love it. I love it. It's got some sun no more rain. Well it's
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.240]   time. Talk to me when it snows. Okay. I'm okay with snow. Yeah. The kids
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.640]   don't like the snow. Yeah. That's right. You got young people that can shovel the
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.560]   discs. Shovel the sidewalk for you and all that. My kids have actually barely
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.680]   ever seen snow. They both grew up in Seattle so this is gonna be new for them.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.320]   They're gonna be in shock. That's right. Will you?
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.160]   You grew up back East. I did. I grew up in Pittsfield, Massachusetts,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.600]   New York area. So I know snow. Very nice. Hey I want to welcome a new
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.200]   contributor to the show Thrilled to Have her. I've actually wanted to have
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.960]   Connie Gliemon for some time. She's editor in chief at CNET. Works with
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.480]   people. Great people like Lindsey Turrentine who's on all the time and it's
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.560]   great to have you Connie. Welcome. Oh is it us or is it Connie? It was us. Say that
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.120]   again Connie. We had you down. Oh my pleasure. Really great to be here. From
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.680]   Silicon Valley. That's right. Yes and she apparently has a CNET sign
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.000]   staple to her head. So no no it's not. It's on the bookshelf. Thank goodness.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.440]   Okay. I think you should represent. I do but that might be going a step too far.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.520]   Apple had an event this week. So did Google. So did Samsung. Let's start with
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.800]   the most important Samsung. Now you can get your flip phone in color.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.880]   Crickets. I have to think Samsung was just a little jealous that Apple and
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.680]   Google were gonna have events and they said oh yeah. Let's do something. What can
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.840]   we do? We could make them in color. Okay. I actually like that flip phone. But
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.280]   I have a flip phone. You have as nice. I got to play with it. It's actually nice. I like it a lot.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.760]   You know Google was rumored to be working on its own flip phone but they
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.120]   didn't announce that on Tuesday or Monday. Tuesday. I'm confused. Tuesday.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.280]   They announced the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro with absolutely zero
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.200]   surprises. We knew exactly what it was gonna look like. What it was gonna be.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.480]   The only surprise was if you tried to order it in which case Google just said
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.840]   no. Sorry. You can't.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   They don't have to demand. They had according to I think according to CNET
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.520]   they are making twice the number of phones they sold last year. Quite optimistic.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.760]   Seven million. Still a low number. Less fewer phones I think than Apple sells on
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.640]   a week. But for the whole year. But I think Google really is putting a lot in
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.960]   on this. Let's start with this phone because I think we'll get to Apple in a
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.160]   bit and I know you have some opinions on that. Have you Connie? Have you guys I'm
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.000]   sure you've already reviewed the Pixel 6 by now? Yes or no? Well we're playing
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.600]   with it right now and you're right. Google is investing a lot into that phone
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.040]   because they want you to use Android and be bought into their whole Pixel
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.960]   ecosystem. The problem is there's a lot of good choices out there for you right
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.760]   now. You mentioned Apple introduced a phone. I mean this is a good problem for
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.080]   consumers to have. You can get a Google Pixel or an Apple iPhone. They're both
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.560]   pretty good phones. I'm not going to comment on the colors for Samsung. I'm
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.640]   not ready to get a flip phone yet. I mean it's a good problem to have when
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.800]   there's competition and be able to push the boundaries. Yeah. Yeah. I had a guy
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.440]   called I had a guy call the radio show today was a hysterical call. Jim said I'm
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.720]   an engineer. I'm a ham and I tried an iPhone. I don't know why anybody would
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.200]   ever buy an iPhone when you can get an Android phone and I said well Jim
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.560]   sometimes people just want phones to work. They don't want to mess with them. He
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.120]   says well yeah there's I was bored. There's nothing you can do with them. I
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.800]   said yes for a lot of people that's a virtue. So I think it's good to have some
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.200]   choice. Some people do like to mess with their phones. The camera is on the Pixel
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.560]   6 and I you know it's really early. Everybody who has one is embargoed and
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.960]   can't yet show photos until I think Tuesday. But somehow some have leaked
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.840]   out and the night shots look spectacular from the Pixel 6. Especially the
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.600]   Pixel 6 Pro. That's going to be that's going to be the selling point. That's
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.320]   always the selling point. I don't care what Apple does. I don't care what Samsung
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.480]   does. Whenever they say the word night I just hit mute for 30 seconds. I don't
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.680]   want to hear nothing that they say that their camera does with a night shot
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.360]   compared to what Google does. That is like the camera is Google's bread and
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.840]   butter like people that have pixels really just think of their photographer
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.080]   and they just want to take pictures. They acknowledge that they have and they
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.440]   use this amazing and their night camera is superior. It should be even better.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:02.040]   This time the sensor is two and a half times larger. I mean they've really
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.280]   doubled down on this. It's mega pixels pixel binning. They got all the
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.320]   things 50 megapixel wide camera with an 82 degree field of view F1.85. What is
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:20.680]   the F stop on that fancy new camera lens you just got for your R5? 1.2. Oh
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:27.400]   shut up. So the lower that number the wider the aperture the more light it can
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.520]   gather. The more difficult it is to focus historically small sensors have not had
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:39.720]   great depth of field but F1.85 is pretty wide for a camera phone. That should make
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.400]   some of that notch. Yeah. Well let's not forget too that they have their own
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.200]   chip the tensor chip and there's some AI built into this version of the pixel.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.240]   I'm not going to dispute that the camera is excellent on pixel phones but they're
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.320]   even pushing the boundaries to kind of idiot proof your photo taking which I
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.120]   am sure will appeal to a lot of people. But it's really that you know that's
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.280]   that phrase computational photography that really is what this comes down to.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.720]   Even if you have these double sized lenses and stuff they're still tight. I mean a
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.200]   half inch is very big a very big sensor for a camera phone but it's still tiny
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.760]   compared to you know your camera doctor oh doctor and others. So you do have to
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.360]   do some processing and that you've got a very powerful computer. Connie it's
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.000]   interesting to see Google do their own chip. Do you know how much of their own
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   chip the tensor chip is? I haven't really given us a whole lot of details in it
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.760]   but it makes a lot of sense that they would want to do their own chip. I mean
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.680]   step aside from what you can pack into a chip the past year has shown us that the
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.360]   supply chain around the world is pretty fragile and if you're relying on Asia
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.640]   for your supply chain in your chips solely you're gonna get into trouble if
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.120]   you're making any kind of a hardware device. All the shortages we're seeing in the
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.120]   market today right or chip shortages. This is you know I don't think this is
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.760]   the reason that Apple started designing its own chip. It had a whole set of
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.360]   issues with Intel years ago which is why it went into the chip world but
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.640]   certainly that is an advantage to them to invest and have the capacity they need
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   to make hardware. So it won't surprise me if they pour even more more money into it.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.720]   Yeah ironically the Apple's investment in hardware the fab is TSMC Taiwan Silicon
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:29.240]   semiconductor manufacturing company it's in Taiwan. No one is admitting who makes
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.560]   the tensor chip but it's widely believed to be Samsung and South Korea so neither
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.200]   of these chips are made in the US but if and it may be this is why Google
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.680]   ordered 7 million phones if you order enough chips TSMC or I suspect Samsung
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.120]   is much more likely to make them for you and in fact Apple famously has pushed
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.760]   everybody out by basically buying up all the production TSMC can give them.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.200]   That's right yeah. Owning the line of production it was a smart move Apple
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.880]   did it I would say like five six years ago they had so much cash and they couldn't
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.400]   figure out where to put that money in terms of products and so they started
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.000]   buying up the supply chains and the factory production lines. They didn't
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.680]   build their own factories they just bought all the capacity basically so
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   they could have at their disposal the inventory they need. There's an advantage
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:26.080]   too and according to Rick Osterlo Google started working on this tensor chip
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.400]   four years ago in 2017. There's another advantage that Apple's really realizing
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.440]   which is if you make the whole stack if you make the hardware the chips the
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.840]   software the operating system you can really design something that's purpose
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.880]   built that's really optimized for the things your device is meant to do photography for
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.000]   instance and so you know that's a real benefit it's been a real benefit to Apple
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.880]   on the iPhone than the iPad now on the Macintosh and I have a feeling that's
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:01.360]   exactly what Google's looking at and there aren't that many companies that can
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.400]   do that kind of integration vertical integration there not many companies
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.840]   that make every that can make everything. Google's one of the few.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.760]   Microsoft I guess could do that I don't you don't I don't want to make you the
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.120]   spokesperson for Microsoft look because you're not but that's one of the other
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.440]   few under companies that could do that they make hardware they could make their
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.240]   own chips I think they are working on their own chips. Yeah I mean all of them
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.720]   use all of them start with a reference architecture a reference product I think
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.040]   obviously Apple starting with one as Google starts with one Microsoft the
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.360]   SQ the SQ processors are all baseline ARM processors from other companies that
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.520]   they basically add specialized hardware to define their OS and I think that's
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.280]   that's the key to being successful I think that's why Apple's being so
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.240]   successful they've been able to start with a baseline and really and really
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.040]   add in their Google's successful because of the tensor process I'll tell you one
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.560]   thing if you add I think there's three cameras on there if you use the other
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.280]   two sensors for detecting light and other things which is what they're doing when
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.960]   they take a picture so you take a picture with one camera and they detect
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.600]   light and do other things with the other the other and then they use the tensor
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.360]   processor to process the that data together that's why they're so good is
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.040]   because they're able to figure all that out and actually have a specialized
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.560]   processor because of it I think that's why they will continue so you start with
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.840]   a baseline you add the extra hardware you will always be number one interesting
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.960]   yeah the baseline in this case arm I don't know how much at this point I mean
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.800]   Apple has an ARM architecture license which means that they can basically do
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.080]   whatever they want I don't know a Google's license with ARM is that they can
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.800]   afford an architecture license so I presume that they've done that that means
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:45.120]   you can customize the heck out of them is it fair to call them ARM chips even
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.500]   Lou absolutely they all they all they all say start with the same
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.040]   architecture and memory model processing it everything's the same and then they
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.800]   just add different components to it to to edit the power adjustments you know
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.720]   special things for the operating system so they do they do all start with ARM
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.320]   and on the same same architecture for sure but why so ARM is not you know you
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.480]   might at then conclude oh well ARM is clearly superior to x86 the architecture
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.800]   used by Intel and AMD but I don't know if that's the case I mean it's a risk
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.380]   architecture reduced instruction set compared to Intel's SIS complex
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.140]   instruction set but by and by itself that does not make ARM superior in some
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.100]   cases arms let you were talking I noticed in the chatroom earlier so I'm
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.060]   gonna steal from you that ARM historically was not great in multi-threaded
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:40.020]   performance so the hard part about ARM is ARM is what they call a weak memory
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.620]   model and that means that they don't they have what they call relaxed memory
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.680]   models how they order the process instruction sets and so like what
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.420]   happens is if you're a developer trying to do concurrent processing and lock and
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.540]   block on the processor for things to wait to wait for reading writing it's
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.240]   really complex really really hard to do so if you're gonna convert your code
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.680]   from x86 to ARM you have to go back in and rewrite almost all of that code to
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.240]   make sure that it does it right and I think it creates a really challenging
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.880]   way of development and so I would say it's not worse it's just a lot harder to
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.080]   challenge and that's where yeah exactly and I think that's why x86 thrived
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.980]   because it was a lot easier there are problems with the they call them race
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.780]   conditions when you when you can't lock the process and you have two different
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.380]   things happening at the same time you can have an unpredictable outcome and
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.420]   that is a big problem source of bugs but aren't there languages I mean Erlang
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.420]   and others that are designed to kind of handle these kind of challenging
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.860]   situations isn't doesn't the compiler take care of that all of them had to
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.580]   adjust like even Java had to adjust they they have you know things like atomic
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.280]   constructs in there of all tile flag stuff like that that that do adjust but
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.760]   again they had to adjust and they had to optimize and that's the key like even
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.400]   you know when C++ 11 came out they were all multi-threaded and all that stuff
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.280]   and I think they had to adjust as well to be able to to handle these
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.120]   compilations for you know especially even the M1 scenarios so even like like
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.280]   office for instance is developed and it runs natively on the M1 system and so
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.580]   like a lot of work had to be done to go and kind of do a bunch of work to make
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.200]   that optimize and really really fast I would say the same thing is for all all
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.360]   the apps yeah very and yeah I had not you know you we should mention Lou is a
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.960]   coder so he's he's intimately familiar with these things and worked on office
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.700]   right are you still product manager correct yeah and I'm on the XL team
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.980]   actually okay so as intimately aware of these issues so I'm glad to hear that I
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.740]   had no idea and so it's fat that's fascinating to me there's also the I mean
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.700]   you know from the end user there's definitely a marketing battle being
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.940]   fought you know Apple has its own chips well so do we we've got tensor you know
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.300]   and I can understand why a company like Google doesn't want to say Qualcomm to
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:02.740]   often are too loud the companies are also held back aren't they gone conny a
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.100]   little bit I think Apple shifted away initially shifted away from power PC
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.380]   because IBM just wasn't paying any attention to that platform and Apple is
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.460]   feeling left out the same thing essentially has happened now with Intel
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.940]   controlling your own destiny there's a lot to be said for that you can release
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.140]   products when you want to yeah and you're talking about capabilities you
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.660]   mentioned Qualcomm right that Google use the Snapdragon chip from Qualcomm right
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.260]   in the previous phones and it just didn't have the processing heft that they
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.180]   wanted as they moved into some of this AI processing you know never mind
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.660]   overheating the phone if you're doing all these computational photography
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.820]   kinds of things as you mentioned so why do you want your future beholden to
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.660]   someone else's R&D schedule you don't especially if you're somebody like Google
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.260]   and you have I don't even know how much cash they have on hand but I know it's
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.620]   a lot plenty would be the operative for it yes actually I remember interviewing
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.100]   Andy Grove way I mean this has historically been a problem we're talking to Andy
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:05.660]   Grove was the CEO back then of Intel this must be almost 30 years ago and he
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.980]   was railing against Microsoft saying we make great 32 I think we saying 32 but
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:15.340]   maybe you say in 16 I don't know processors and Microsoft just won't make
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.100]   the operating system keep up and you know so it goes both ways hard work
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.860]   companies sometimes feel hobbled by software companies again another
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.340]   advantage to owning the whole stack then you just go down the hall and yell at
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.580]   the product manager for the operating system say well and let's remember
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.660]   Google started out as a software company right it's got a certain that's true
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.540]   they have all of this home devices speakers nest I mean they have a lot of
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.700]   gadgets and gear that they want to put into your home so it's not just an
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.780]   investment in the phone it's the investment and having you buy into their
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.660]   whole ecosystem which I mean Apple is trying to do the same and we can
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:58.580]   debate the merits of their home pod or not but Google has certainly been
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.740]   did I say did I mention it comes in colors now
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:09.100]   but Google has been very aggressive right on the hardware side of things
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:14.580]   nest and all of the yeah they're a hardware company yeah yeah this this thing
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.260]   is the best thing I got going on in my house right now what is that thing the
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.780]   little YouTube it's that oh the remote for the Google TV yeah yeah I mean it's
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.980]   sensitive as I don't know what but I mean it is it just works man but that's
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:32.900]   such a Google product because Google's so confused in life they had an Android
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.580]   TV and then they said no they had Chromecast no we're gonna do this thing
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:41.580]   it's Google what do they call it it's Google TV now Google TV but is it and but
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.900]   then the it's so confusing it's like well how is what is that is that what is
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.900]   that compared to Android TV well it's the same but different it's it's the same
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:54.180]   with the remote it fix the problem I have to ask everything I could use this
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.620]   little bad but don't don't try to conflate what they've done with this
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.420]   okay this thing works it's a good remote well it's better than the Apple TV
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.340]   remote I'll bring you that interface is sexy I don't replace all the things in
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.820]   my main TV with this thing my daughter loves this limit that's the only remote
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.620]   in your house no I've got 92 TVs I've got 92
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.180]   I mean I got a color code to back and put numbers on the back so I know which
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.940]   ones with but that is amazing that is a modern it's an upgrade a symbol of
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:28.140]   modern life is the the armchair arm with five six ten remotes on it yeah yeah
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.380]   no no more no more no more this little bad boy and I'm one thing I don't bite
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.660]   into it but I think it's a candy bar yeah it does look good other than that
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:43.820]   basically like a little white baby Ruth so related to this is Intel's decision
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:49.380]   recently to become a foundry and I'm I'm really curious what you think of that
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:55.460]   Connie because Intel in a way is it looks to me throwing up the white flag
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.780]   saying yeah we just can't get down to these five nanometer three nanometer
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:06.340]   processes the TSMC's doing and our chip design is kind of laggard even AMD
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.180]   starting to beat us I know let's change our business model instead of designing
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:17.540]   and making our own chips will make chips for other people even he said get
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:23.100]   Pat Gelsinger's new CEO even Apple should they ever want to come to our
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:28.900]   factories is Intel saying we're not gonna make we're not gonna design anymore
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.700]   we're just gonna make other people's chips this is their new business model I
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:38.500]   think that they've been slow in the mobile market as we all know yes they
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.420]   missed it they missed it screwing up the mobile market yes is legendary that's
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.220]   that's the subject of many books I think their decision to announce the
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.460]   foundry ties in you know I hate to bring it up and be the you know
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:57.100]   economist on this call but please do supply chain right both the prior
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.100]   administration and now Biden care about made in America you're not gonna make a
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.940]   read completely replace the chip industry that's in Asia but I actually
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.820]   interview the woman who is the new made in America's are for Biden and what they
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.660]   want to get to is enough redundancy here in the US enough supply so if
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:21.540]   something does happen you know again some sort of global event that disrupts
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.860]   the supply chain that there will be capacity in the US so that means that
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.700]   there's investment there's money that you can go get to go set up this foundry
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.020]   and that's I think part of what Intel is doing they're playing into this made in
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:39.780]   America help defend the position by again not replacing or duplicating what is
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.420]   being manufactured in Asia which is you know I don't you can't but just enough
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.380]   so that you have redundancy here in the US and so Intel becomes your fall back
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.300]   basically it's actually pretty smart was this stimulated by the chip shortage or
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.180]   other economic forces it was just oh my god we better have some own our
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:03.900]   capacity of our own yeah I mean I think the the chip shortage we're feeling that
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:09.180]   right now right people can't buy cars refrigerate I mean think of any piece of
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.900]   equipment that doesn't have a chip in it everything has a chip in it so if you
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:18.860]   can get some of that manufactured here where you're not beholden to other
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.820]   supply chains around the world and it's not just making them you know someplace
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.300]   else it's getting them here transportation right there's a shortage now of
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:33.060]   shipping containers and truckers all of that so it's pulling that you know
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.820]   problem out of your way at least enough so that you can take care of some
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:43.580]   redundancy and that's really what this made in America initiative is part of
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.300]   there's money going into it because people recognize just how much the US is
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.380]   at the mercy of others to play chains around the world even the Defense
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.300]   Department is in this the Defense Department enlisted Intel to increase
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:03.420]   American foundry capacity they pointed out that 80% of chips that we use are
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:08.540]   made in Asia 80% of leading edge manufacturing capacity concentrated in
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:13.660]   Asia leaving the Department of Defense with limited on-shore access to foundry
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:19.260]   technology and there's this security concern you know we Huawei is a perfect
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:26.100]   poster child for this we don't dare use their stuff in our 5g networks so there
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:31.620]   is a there is a economic reason to do this there's a national security reason
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:37.940]   to do this and Intel's the last company in America that still makes chips so it's
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.020]   gonna it's really natural it's gonna come down on its shoulders it's really an
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.660]   opportunity I guess yeah well let's let's remember the US government spends
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:51.700]   600 billion dollars on parts that's the purchasing power of the government and
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:57.620]   they want is that a year yep 600 billion dollar annual purchasing budget and they
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.940]   now have requirements about what percentage of what you're selling them
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:06.020]   has to be made in the US so if Intel can capture more of that it's an easy win
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.740]   yeah if they can do it yeah that's the big question it's one of their last
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.660]   hopes of survival because Intel is dead in the water they better start doing
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:19.500]   everything they can to hold on to some kind of market share and reliability so
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.380]   good luck yeah Intel yeah yeah actually I wish them the best absolutely yeah no
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.660]   they they have the work the work the workstation market the PC market is
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:33.340]   still huge but don't you think it's limited I don't think so I don't think
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.180]   so you'll you'll be surprised that you'll be surprised what Intel will come
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.560]   out with and and you know obviously we already know the other Lake platform is
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.940]   almost identical to the M1 platform it's just got power issues
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:49.060]   comparably but but that's a big point for network operation centers power is a
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.540]   big cost prop problem sure right yep I mean look if you look at AWS they have
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.540]   their gravitron processor right they did that for a purpose and again we get
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.180]   can't forget the amazon's you know the I think it's the they're the stealth
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.140]   organization out there they do electronics to and now they're doing
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:09.540]   servers and and as well as AMD I'm sorry arm prosters as well but the same
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.660]   thing with Intel is I think they will figure it out well they go arm no but I
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.260]   think that they will figure it out and they will make something I mean everyone
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.700]   talks about mobile processors when we talk about data center they still
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:25.260]   dominate and I think AMD and Intel will continue to dominate unless arm can
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.660]   figure out how to be in the data center and it be efficient data center great
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.100]   article in ours technical by Tim DeChant talking about kind of the history of
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.060]   this and I didn't I wasn't aware of this but one of the reasons TSMC has
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:41.740]   succeeded is because they had so many customers because they were making
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.980]   chips for hundreds of different customers different customers had
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:50.060]   different needs different technologies more advanced technologies and it allowed
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:56.180]   TSMC to build skill sets in a broad range of areas in the latest technology
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.380]   to build machines these are very expensive machines in in these more
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:06.300]   modern technologies and so when the time came they were really well positioned
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:13.140]   to become a leader in chip fabrication we you know it was our in a way it was our
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:19.700]   mistake you know not not becoming these a foundry company was a mistake in this
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.860]   country not to not to really encourage these boundaries this is a extreme
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:29.420]   ultraviolet lithography machine an example of the very very high tech
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:35.500]   machines used to design chips each one of these machines there's a quote in here
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.980]   costs a hundred twenty million dollars and to be a chip fab you might have to
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:46.100]   buy a dozen or more every year for the next several years that gives you some
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:51.540]   idea of how difficult this is and this is bleeding edge technology so you know
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.140]   this is one of the reasons we always talk about why didn't Intel get past 10
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.620]   nanometers well it's things like this and why how did TSMC get to five
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:05.100]   nanometers so much more quickly by being a foundry working for many many
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.100]   different companies they were able to develop that Sunday but somebody else
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:14.220]   yeah it's really interesting excellent article about this and I you know I
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.660]   agree with you Lou I I want to tell to succeed I want to survive just as I want
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.780]   AMD to survive AMD is a much smaller company but faced with many of the same
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.860]   challenges what about Nvidia do you think Nvidia first of all do you think
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.260]   they will succeed in their attempt to buy arm it looks like they're getting
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.300]   some severe headwinds in Europe Connie what do you think of the prospect of
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:41.900]   Nvidia buying them yeah I don't know honestly I think I know why they want to
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.260]   buy her yeah for a lot of money by the way it's
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.900]   significant well they're looking at the future and they're trying to do 40
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:55.500]   billion dollars yeah yeah whether they will or not that's an open question
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.140]   there's a lot of I mean this is kind of an aside but there's a lot of fear of
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.300]   tech companies right now around the world no kidding every merger and
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:09.700]   acquisition is getting you know extra extra scrutiny and certainly the EU is
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.900]   much more aggressive about scrutinizing all of those deals than we are in the
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.140]   US it's not to say we're not scrutinizing them but we're not doing it at the
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:21.460]   level that the EU has been doing it so that is I think that is the underlying
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.180]   issues that they don't can't that they can't anticipate what they're
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.020]   signing off on and so there's hesitancy to sign off on these kinds of deals yeah
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:34.140]   I have high hopes for Nvidia I feel like they're doing a lot of great
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:39.100]   innovation they do not make their own chips however just like arm they're a
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.380]   architecture company not a foundry so maybe this is a nice hand-in-hand with
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:50.220]   Intel I don't know it's I think they might be too late though I think you know
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.580]   once once Apple bought these companies they started with arm and now they've
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.580]   built their own architecture off of the architecture another different from
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.300]   arm in some sense and they don't necessarily have to pay they don't need
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.780]   arm at this point right they don't need it anymore yeah I think they might be
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.060]   too late I think that's what I think here interesting yeah in fact I've seen
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:14.260]   articles that say in video do just fine here's one from Forbes but arm well
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:20.540]   that's another that's another matter they may struggle let's say I want to
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.580]   take a little break there is so much to talk about today I'm so glad we have
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.980]   such a smart panel this is great Owen and I will just sit back what Connie and
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:32.780]   Lou explain the world to us how about that I'm gonna test on autopilot I'm
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:40.060]   just here fine that's all the Eagles doing I turn the TV off ugly are we
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:45.740]   out this is done season for me that game I watch yeah right now we're
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.900]   that our 49ers are playing in a monsoon tonight in the Santa Clara's I don't
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.700]   know what's gonna be like it's gonna be a messy fun that fun to watch somebody
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:01.740]   my wife says oh don't worry Jimmy Garoppolo's a mutter so what no he does
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.100]   great in the mud okay football in the rain is snow is good football it's fun
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:12.100]   I agree our Michael as you know our 18 year old is a Green Bay Packers fan
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.660]   yeah he gets all good weather yeah I thought I'm bringing you to Lambo field
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:22.100]   of December we'll see let's see and you're gonna go can I go give me a ticket I
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:27.260]   fly out would you come with this oh that would be all I know that would be
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.780]   awesome that's a store for I mean I mean I'm gonna be dressed up in like three
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.620]   parkas and no looking like a good pink your chest yellow and gold green and
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:44.140]   gold a and go topless I'm not losing the toe or nipple for my right now it's not
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:50.020]   worth it too cold out this is not worth it I showed it a great panel here thank
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.220]   you and Lou it's great to have you I always like to get you on such a good
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.220]   host on this weekend enterprise tech and you're obviously you can see why we
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:01.660]   value his his brains really nice to have you here our showed I want to talk
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.900]   about the M1 we'll talk about them pro and the max and a little bit there's
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:11.420]   lots to talk about also a tweet storm about Google's ad tech business that
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:18.660]   may be the beginning of some serious scrutiny for Google and Facebook together
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:23.140]   but first a word for my sponsor is they say our show they brought to you by
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:27.700]   CrowdStrike this is to me this is one of the most interesting security companies
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.940]   out there you you know you've seen us talk you've seen the headlines security
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:37.700]   now is pretty much all about ransomware ransomware attack after
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:42.780]   ransomware attack now they're going after the food supply if you're a business
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:49.220]   owner or a CISO or a IT guy you you probably feel like it's just a matter of
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:54.220]   time before they come for you and then you have to make the fateful decision do
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:59.980]   you pay or do you lose everything but there is a third option which is to beat
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:05.740]   them before the fight even starts with CrowdStrike you're not alone in the
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:11.420]   battle against ransomware it's in the name CrowdStrike uses the threat graph
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:19.020]   from all their users one trillion signals a day seven trillion a week to
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:24.700]   analyze see what's going on in the net analyze behavior on your devices your
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.900]   servers cloud workflows to find the threats and stop them before they stop
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:34.700]   you CrowdStrike's Falcon platform uses their threat graph power with advanced
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:40.540]   AI I actually I was so interested in this I got their CTO on the line Michael
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:45.460]   Scentonus because I wanted him to kind of I was trying to understand what do
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:50.060]   you mean CrowdStrike how does threat graph help find the threats all the
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.660]   data points the signals that we get come from the endpoints and the workloads
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:35:00.180]   that we have around the world so we have an incredibly distributed network of
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:04.860]   customers from all around the world and threat graph enables our platform to
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:10.060]   correlate those approximately seven trillion endpoint related events per
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.540]   week in real time it's amazing but it makes sense if you could have your finger
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:20.980]   on the pulse of the global security stature you'd have an idea you have an
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:25.060]   early warning system would you that's exactly the idea Falcon Complete
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.980]   delivers the industry's most powerful set of tools to fight today's sophisticated
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.260]   cyber attacks and the nice thing is they do the work it's all delivered to you
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:39.140]   via the cloud in a lightweight intelligent agent for study they found
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:45.460]   the Falcon Complete delivers an ROI of 403 percent I will add and it gives you
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.140]   100 percent confidence CrowdStrike is harnessing the power of every click

[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:43.740]   together is worth defending together CrowdStrike we thank them so much for
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.420]   supporting a you support to it when you go to that address by the way so that
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:52.260]   they know you saw it here CrowdStrike.com/twit
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:58.380]   all right so we talked a little bit about the Pixel 6 actually Jason Howell
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.500]   has a Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro he's good he is embargoed he was able to
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.340]   show it but you can't review it you can't show pictures but I think all about
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.980]   Android on Tuesdays my guess I don't he's not even I think he's not even
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.380]   allowed to tell me when the embargo lifts he just goes I can't but I think
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.220]   Tuesday will have a review I hope so because I'm gonna steal it from him
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:25.060]   because I'm going to Mexico on Wednesday and I want to take pictures of the day
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.340]   of the dead stuff I'm going out on a walk and I think with a Pixel 6 should be
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:33.380]   amazing but watch only camera you'll need do you think I could I borrow your
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:40.020]   your 1.2 lens when the R5 man I love you but I just said this my new one I
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.380]   can't just give my new born up for some I had a watch my fifth only had a week
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:50.660]   millimeter F 1.2 lens that must have that's what what here's the thing right so I
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:55.820]   own this house scam technology is right so I've had I got all the Canon
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.540]   lens right this is a 70 to 200 yeah you know that you see that on the sidelines
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:04.940]   of every football game that's that Canon color that beige yeah so I'm gonna
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.820]   tell you how dumb some people are right like I do this I use this stuff for
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:12.300]   working everything right but this thing costs $3,000 since the new version it's
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.700]   slightly better than the old version but it's new so you buy it then my
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.220]   daughter plays sports so I bought the 100 to 500 the new version you know
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.300]   because yeah yeah that thing was yeah and that thing was $3,200 and then I bought
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:29.300]   this and I will tell you you know you remember like what do you so no no let
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.140]   me just say like like remember like six years ago or seven years ago my house
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.660]   got robbed yeah you lost every sandy storm yeah I lost $50,000 or stuff and
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:42.100]   finally at this point today your back I have re spent $30,000 in camera gear
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.100]   and I don't know why I did it I got it good about it I got a worse I got a
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:52.820]   worse story I did the same thing for a mark for a 5d mark 4 which is like my
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:58.540]   fourth Canon body but all those lenses now they got a new body I got to get new
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:04.300]   lenses the body doesn't matter I okay so I had to 70 to 200 I had a 72
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.780]   or is that for the oh that's the old FV no this is our ass this is the new one
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:16.060]   shut up I had the old EF right yeah I had that lens for 20 years yeah until I got
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.340]   robbed what do you do oh he's got it too bad yeah they don't go bad the glasses
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.940]   we got spend the money at the body I got the R but it's got a new mouth can I
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:29.540]   can I put that art you're a fan and sugar - I guess you got our six I got our
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:34.220]   six I had the US shut up I got the pixel six pro baby that's
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:38.300]   all I need that's all you need in Mexico to I believe that you can get the
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.140]   challenge yourself I believe in you uncle yeah I'm a challenge is so much right
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.540]   I might bring about how much money you spent an apple this was oh my god was
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:56.380]   this an expensive week so I okay you know what Connie Lou Owen talk me down I
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:03.460]   am still in the reality distortion field we watch the event Apple announces the
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:11.300]   new M1 pro and as if that weren't good enough the new N1 Max double the I mean
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:16.660]   everything's doubled or tripled over the M1 which was already fast and the memory
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:25.620]   bandwidth is 3000 gigabytes a second and it's just like what is going on I
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.740]   feel like Apple is flexing at this point they didn't announce any desktop
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.060]   computers they only announced we're gonna ignore the fact they announced
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:39.380]   colored mini home pods we're gonna ignore the fact that they announced a
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:47.740]   hundred seventy nine dollar I pod thing which the AirPods for a hundred seventy
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:53.860]   nine dollars which is crazy don't even go there but they didn't know they just
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:59.940]   announced laptops that these are updates the Macbook Pro 14 and 16 and they
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:06.420]   on paper anyway 21 hours of battery life on paper these things look like they
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.700]   speed passed everybody else the only negative thing I've seen them remember
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.140]   nobody has one yet review or they haven't but they can't talk about them
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.500]   reviews aren't out yet so we'll see real numbers again I'm in the reality
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:24.740]   distortion field but the worst thing I saw was Tom's hardware said well okay
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:32.580]   they're pretty fast but the GPU on the Macbook Pro 16 isn't quite as fast as a
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:41.380]   maxed out in Vidya on a desktop well yeah it's a laptop
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:47.580]   Wow okay I'm Connie am I nuts should I just take a chill pill and relax is this
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:53.700]   not the best thing ever well you should wait for the reviews I guess so yes but
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:58.620]   to your point are they supposed to be smoking faster what's apples expression
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:04.820]   wicked fast yeah I mean that's their whole selling point the CPU number of
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:11.900]   GPU cores you know starting RAM all of that I mean up up up and why because most
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:18.300]   people have laptops nobody needs this no I mean there's there's people who need
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:23.820]   it but there's a small tiny number of people right well the I guess you can
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:28.620]   never have power and do much speed that's the things you don't think you need it
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.100]   people like me go oh I have to have it even though I'm really all I'm doing
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.860]   is doing you know taking notes in apples notes I mean I'm not I'm not
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:43.180]   exactly challenging anything I'm not gonna need all this 4,000 gigabytes per
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:49.500]   second memory bandwidth 57 billion transistors in the M1 Mac that that
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:54.620]   includes memory the unified memory though 64 gigabytes is interesting because
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.780]   that memory is available of course for the CPU but also for the GPU so you now
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:07.100]   have a laptop which has massive memory on the GPU built in hardware decoding and
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:15.740]   encoding for video for ProRes MP4 and HEVC a neural engine I don't even know
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:21.780]   what you can do with that maybe build a held 9,000 I don't know it's under both
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:27.660]   so you okay you didn't answer my question you you spent money what did you buy
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:34.820]   okay well some of this I had to buy I'm not asking whether you did I'm just
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:41.500]   about about if you don't include about $10,000 no no which version which one
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:46.060]   did I got okay I bought two of the I to maxed out one of them is a gift because
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.540]   I promised a graduation gift to my nephew who just graduated from an island
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.900]   school design he's a graphics designer he needed a high-end laptop so I'd
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.420]   promised him but I thought they were gonna come out June they didn't come out
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.980]   he needs it because he's using high-end graphics stuff he needs it really good
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:07.940]   GPU and then one I got for testing here and then see maybe kind of doesn't know
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:14.660]   this but we are stupid we buy everything that we're gonna review so I we don't
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.940]   because I don't like Apple I don't want to talk to him so we didn't you know we
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:22.700]   have people who do this who get loners Jason got a loaner the Pixel 6 I'm sure
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.500]   Renee Richie has all the Apple laptops but we so I bought one that will review
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.340]   and then I'll give it to our our lead editor Anthony Nielsen because he
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:37.220]   should probably have this but but you'll be proud of me Owen it hurt I didn't
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:44.460]   want to but I bought the base model M1 Pro a mere $2,000 because I could get
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.140]   that one on Tuesday so they would so I'd have a chance of reviewing it
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.580]   so okay Lou do you have anything to say about this Apple stuff before I get into
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:57.060]   this because I can tell you're gonna beat me out aren't you I do I do actually
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:02.260]   you know what I'm a huge fan I'm a big fan actually the the M1
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:07.500]   architecture when we first got our hands on that was like ridiculously fast
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.980]   like I think we were able to compile a full you know office client as faster
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:16.580]   than our exam processors I'll tell you like it's very fast and and this is even
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:21.700]   like twice as fast as that was more even faster than that like it's you're
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:27.700]   talking about like seven times more transistors and even their desktop
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:35.100]   there's still gonna be a Mac mini pro and an iMac Pro and a Mac Pro next year
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:42.540]   I it Apple is just as I mean it looks like I think Omala call him said a number
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.780]   of people said look you know what they're a silicon company now they are no
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:51.300]   longer operating system company they no longer a computer company there they
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:56.980]   are a silicon company it's a this is a Steve this is Steve Jobs's thing though I
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.060]   think about it this is this is what Steve Jobs would have done if he was a
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.700]   silicon company right he he threw the kitchen sink in they threw the kitchen
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.700]   sink in just to sell how powerful they can be and there's nobody's gonna be
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:13.140]   able to catch up one to two years yes right so let's talk about it this is
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.500]   the Macbook Pro is now a completely stepped away from Intel right this is
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:23.900]   all Apple all Apple Silicon and they went over the top also remember Apple has
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.700]   suffered with the pro market on their laptops because absolutely more powerful
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:33.780]   Windows machine no question yeah you know up until they announced this people
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.220]   were like it's not worth the money right all of the designers and programmers
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:42.780]   and so they're just trying to smoke out the market and $2,000 for the 14 inch
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:47.220]   Mac Pro with all of that capacity that makes them very competitive now and
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.340]   will they be two years ahead I don't know I hope Lou maybe he's right but I
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:55.740]   don't think everybody can catch up yeah I don't I don't see how you catch up
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.380]   because you're using off the shelf components that are not beautifully
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.820]   integrated with your operating system and so you just you're limited off the
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.660]   shelf is never gonna be good as purpose built and these are purpose built
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:12.500]   they're basically Swift machines they're designed to run Apple software
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:18.780]   optimally okay now can I get in that it is no no no I'm not done yet one more
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:24.380]   thing come on then it's your turn the thing that's really interesting is this
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:32.580]   is a complete repudiation to your point Connie of the 2016 Macbook Pro's they
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:36.660]   basically said oh yeah sorry about that keyboard sorry about the touch bar
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:43.980]   really sorry about the magsafe really sorry oh god did we blow it and we're
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:50.300]   gonna make it thicker heavier we're gonna put it just to make you people from
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:55.020]   the 90s feel okay we're gonna put an HDMI port and an SD card reader on there
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:48:01.940]   by the way UHS 2 pretty good nice fast one it's it's almost as if they said
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:10.860]   Johnny I've doesn't work here anymore right doesn't yeah so this is I think for
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.860]   people like me who loved the Mac from nice going back to 1984 I'm relieved it
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:20.060]   really after 20 I kept my 2015 Macbook forever because it's 2016 I thought
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:24.180]   they don't care about the Mac they're an iPhone and iPad company and this is an
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:28.660]   afterthought and boy I mean that's not the case clearly not the case now okay
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:36.540]   I'm done oh doctor it's your turn flamey roast me is the kid say it's not you
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:41.740]   first or foremost physically this is a sexy Lamborghini oh yes you brought me
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:48.180]   ports back you brought me to me I can plug things into it but the Lambo needs
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:56.020]   a hydrogen fuel system and no one has hydrogen I was conned into buying a Mac
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.220]   mini I got it fully tricked out I thought to myself it was gonna be the best
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:03.940]   but wait a minute yes what you got the old one you want the new one I got the
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:11.380]   new one no that's the old new one there's gonna be a new new one I live in a
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:17.060]   Dolby lifestyle and I can't edit photos on my M1 now you tell me what that you
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:23.500]   got no you don't wait a minute wait a minute listen lightroom Photoshop camera
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:28.740]   one all of that capture one all of them are now in one native they were okay
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.580]   took a while I admit is a you as a user and someone who talks to photographers
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.460]   all the time it is slow as I don't know what I tell you what they don't like it
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:42.740]   you don't like it people people don't like it is not just me I will send you some
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:47.220]   files you go open it up on your current one and tell me how you know but but I
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:52.580]   my current M1 is now gonna be the M1 pro but okay that's and the guess what
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.940]   for all the Lamborghini
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:50:01.380]   for how let me better work 400 gigabytes a second better work in industry standard
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:05.220]   programs so is the issue that all these numbers are you want but I do
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.540]   compatible I think that's changing Apple stock I think that's changing I
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:14.220]   agree look they did Roseetta to which is good Intel stuff run okay not great but
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:18.620]   I'm surprised even now when I open my M1 notebook and I look at the activity
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:23.700]   viewer there are no Intel processes anymore almost everything my emacs is
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:28.940]   freaking M1 native maybe it maybe is just me or maybe it's just can user maybe
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.540]   is the file that the way this file is maybe it's too bad I don't know what it
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:38.180]   is but I know the files are too big that's clearly the problem no I know it has a
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:44.260]   Owen has a good point Apple has lost professional users and they're not coming
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:48.540]   back they're not coming back I want to come back I think I think they might come
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.900]   back because it comes down to you know computers are religious experience right
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:57.900]   and if you you're unhappy with your religion because they it's very good
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.100]   point you know left you behind you might be more willing to give them a
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.660]   second second try but there's no question that people abandoned the Mac
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:12.340]   pro models they were not you know had a ball fast and so this is their answer
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:16.220]   to that you're talking to somebody who bought a very expensive trash can Mac
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:24.380]   look oh yes now what were you doing I mean I deeply regret the wasted money it
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.660]   was terrible you're and that's why I'm just why I'm yelling at you about this
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.340]   so I'm gonna send you some files because I know you're a person who paid for your
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.980]   own stuff so I can believe you when you say you opened it and it's late in
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:39.340]   fast I watched so many reviewers say oh this is the no it's not all right I'm
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.140]   gonna I'll tell you what send me whatever that file is and what do you want me to
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:49.300]   open it in a lightroom and Photoshop okay I might even say some 8k video you can
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:54.500]   go pop that up me some 8k video and again when I say that I will say final cut
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.740]   is smooth as butter boy like I said what what is their products their product
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:05.820]   it is on my iPad my new iPad and a little mini it is phenomenally fast on 8k which
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:10.820]   is impressive for the finish is my machine this is a laptop right I mean
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:15.140]   yeah that's for again Apple products I expected to destroy anything that I
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.780]   throw at it Apple native wise but I just want to see how it works all the
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:22.220]   programs and I'm gonna buy one to uncle I'm coming back like like room
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.900]   like room classic Lightroom classic is M1 I don't know about the new Lightroom
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:30.340]   I hate it anyway so but Lightroom classic is M1 I Photoshop is M1 so they're
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.820]   native now you're getting the thing that's interesting here is you're getting
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:38.820]   because it's unified memory it backed me up on this loop you're getting really
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.820]   good throughput because everything's on the same die at same core same thing
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.940]   like or but same die well you get to remember the first M1 processor was just
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:51.260]   to tease the market it was it's you know they called it the Macbook Pro but it
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:55.540]   wasn't no no it was the entry level everybody told me entry level don't think
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.740]   of this anything but entry level now I you get to remember nobody's had a
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:03.540]   long time now years to go in and to go into to build against this new
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:08.100]   architecture I can almost guarantee when this thing comes out there'll be
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:13.820]   updates and you'll see a big difference and and and Lou just to be fair as you
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:17.940]   know someone doesn't know me I yell at this I bought one I've already ordered
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:23.700]   one you just be a hard time how much is you spend this Monday I'm just saying
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:29.460]   I'm just saying I mean look I again the big you talk about religion the biggest
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.700]   thing to say about what I got robbed before my max that's stolen I thought
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.580]   to myself you know I'm gonna start building a PC and for the last six years
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:40.500]   I've done nothing but build PCs and this laptop has real be back in because
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:45.460]   guess what no more goggles I could actually plug things oh I mean it's this
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.660]   I was dumb they had me at max safe okay they had me at max safe all right that's
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:55.340]   all your boy needed so we're gonna find out Uncleo we're gonna find out what a
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.180]   yard ordered one I heard the base model because I thought well let's see how
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.380]   the base model is you know I mean that's gonna be interesting I'll be comparing
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:07.820]   that basically to an M1 from last year but I have I again it's just numbers on
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:12.780]   the page it's numbers provided by Apple so you can't really say this is how it
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:17.220]   is on paper it really looks very impressive and it looks like it's got
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:21.580]   some amazing chops and I went mid-steer because you can't update anything once
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:25.180]   you get the ball it's all it's all on the mother yeah I'm even on the mother
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:31.340]   boy down the memories in yeah yes so see you yeah upgradable no you can't
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:37.420]   max it out that's it yeah you got to max it yeah that's why the Apple card is
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:45.220]   suffering and oh god I still have once I didn't get my 3% oh some people got
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:49.380]   6% by the way and it turns out for a while I thought oh this is good they're
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.380]   upping it 6% and then Apple said no that was a mistake but we are gonna
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:57.860]   on but we're gonna honor it so good for them you may have guns I don't think I
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:02.460]   got six back I wish I had what's that's that's a lot of money that's 600 bucks
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:07.660]   yeah yeah I knew it would be an expensive week I just didn't know how
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:12.060]   expensive yeah I guess that I'll give you a hundred six percent of ten thousand
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:16.060]   dollars I didn't get the new watch and I didn't get the new phone said help
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:22.420]   justify the laptop purchase I tried to get a six percent of ten is 600 bucks
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:30.220]   right my wrong was I need an M1 process and clearly I need M1 Max my I need a
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:34.420]   better city or an operation I can't do that's right give me integers baby I
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:38.940]   can't I can't do it fast enough to do fractions that's all we need to know
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:48.220]   really you know I have to say emax runs so beautifully it's so sweet it's just
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.980]   great actually you max believe it or not did make a major leap because they're
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:57.620]   doing native native compilation now so it is it is very lickety split fast oh
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:02.500]   is VS code though Leo I don't know I like VS code I know but it's electron right
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:07.380]   yeah but it runs natively now oh really oh yeah that's right there's native
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:13.900]   electron yeah that's one advantage to using electron it sure is anybody
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:18.260]   wanted to defend the third generation air pods for $179
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:23.220]   anybody have an accident charging on them they have mags that's charging oh
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:27.900]   course I am a but a big puck on the bottom of my air pods did you buy them
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:32.780]   no of course not well you should lots of people are gonna buy them now of course
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.900]   if you don't have the pros already you're gonna get these for sure I think it'll
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:40.940]   be bigger less than the pros so yeah that's got and it has noise cancellation
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:46.300]   right so it's got it's like pro-ish do they I don't know I don't think they
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:51.160]   have no no they just have spatial audio that they said spatial I am not paying
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:56.720]   $179 for spatial audio that's crazy but do you have the pro headphones okay I
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:02.140]   admit I brought the bought the pro max headphones
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:08.380]   you know what $50 for nothing you and I shouldn't be saying thing is these yeah
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:14.100]   these are like 200 bucks a kugel threw in a pair of Google buds with my phone
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:23.980]   they just throw it in for free so I I'm not an air pods fan I admit and I'm
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:26.900]   actually getting to be less of a spatial audio fan you want to defend
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:35.940]   spatial audio anybody no no it's a gimmick it's a gimmick I honestly I first I
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.620]   thought oh this is huge it's gonna be trained but then I realized I don't
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:43.460]   really want the cello to come from over my left here over here I don't it should
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:50.140]   all be in front of me like a normal band and and spatial is is artificial it's
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:54.900]   not it's not how it's not real it's artificial I don't like that stereo is
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.100]   fine because because it's stereo it's left and right ear and it's a band in
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:03.860]   front of me where it belongs not above me below me to the left and behind me
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:07.460]   and all that stuff that's crazy I think the big key here though is it's still
[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:11.980]   got the h1 processor in it and I think you'll start to see more and more people
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:16.620]   especially people who are you know losing hearing or whatnot I guarantee more
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:19.780]   people will buy these and use them because of just the capability of
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:22.980]   amplifying their same their ambient sound around them and so on I think this
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:28.300]   is this is gonna be the platform when does they delayed it but the FDA has
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:34.220]   agreed to make hearing aids it over the counter product yes that's very gonna
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:38.740]   be very necessary big transition yeah hearing aids my hearing aids are six
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:43.300]   thousand dollars and the hearing aid companies are doing what companies do
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:47.100]   in the fashion say this is an electronic you just buy it any store these are
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:51.420]   specialty items it can't just be so so many people need the devices and can't
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:56.340]   afford them so they go without to have them have options that's why a lot of
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:59:00.780]   people have used iPhones headphones for that reason I read a article about that
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.580]   too but same or can you talk about the other headphones you got to have more
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.180]   options I hear for these people because most people with hearing deficits go
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:15.340]   without hearing aids so currently this was supposed to happen I think last
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:18.900]   year but currently according to the FDA and I'm at their website there are no
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:24.420]   products that can be legally marketed as over-the-counting hearing aids they
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:28.100]   continue to be restricted devices which means you got to have you got to go to
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:33.300]   an audiologist you got it's it's much more expensive at some point though and
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:37.980]   and you know maybe maybe this such a big lobby the hearing aid lobby at some
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.940]   point when they go over the counter I think you're gonna see some huge
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:46.980]   breakthroughs and Apple could easily be right in there right you have really
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:50.940]   low latency and you have really high-powered phone in your pocket right like
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:55.660]   I think that's gonna be with great microphones right right
[00:59:55.660 --> 01:00:02.220]   yeah I'm trying to find out what the what the ETA is for over the counter
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:09.140]   hearing aids it's not the FDA website does not have anything except it hasn't
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:16.020]   happened this the FDA reauthorization act of get this 2017 mandated over the
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:21.700]   counter okay so the currently regulations are published for public
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:26.100]   content comment and will eventually publish final regulations eventually
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:31.380]   someday in the in the future yeah they missed their deadline to release the
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:37.140]   guidelines for doing it of course they did because the big companies that make
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:44.820]   six thousand dollars per pair are slowing it down I'm sure all right I I
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:51.460]   think we probably need to talk about the elephant in the room big tech because
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.020]   it is a big-ass elephant you don't want to throw a ad read in there for us
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.980]   where you get under this maybe you're right maybe you're right let's a good
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.940]   idea on let's let's pay these bills pay these bills then we'll talk about big
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:12.180]   tech big thread the apparently the the attorneys general lawsuit against Google
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:16.540]   the documents have now been unredacted and are available and there's a big
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.180]   thread on Twitter from people who are a number of threats people were reading
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:24.620]   them and coming up with some surprising information this is the lawsuit it was
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:29.460]   headed by the Texas AG but I think almost every state signed on to it Google's
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:33.780]   got some explaining to do we'll talk about that in just a little bit our show
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:40.340]   today brought to you by worldwide tech love them and VMware WWT at the
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.940]   forefront of innovation working with clients all over the world to transform
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:49.820]   their businesses WWT and VMware together work to help you accelerate your
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:55.260]   digital transformation journey by combining WWT's IT consulting and
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:00.060]   solutions and other services with VMware's technology platforms they
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:04.620]   develop the flexible scalable and secure technology solutions you need to
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:11.060]   achieve your business ambitions WWT why we were out there that was our you know
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:18.300]   last trip before COVID when March of 2020 and saw all the things that WWT
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:23.460]   does I was blown away this if you are buying enterprise technology this is your
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:29.500]   partner you and by the way they are partners they're a VMware principal
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:34.020]   partner holding seven master service competencies
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:39.820]   WWT's proven approach and powerful infrastructure help you discover evaluate
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:43.340]   architect and implement advanced technology and you can do it in that
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:48.020]   amazing lab this is one of the things we saw the ATC the Advanced Technology
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:53.460]   Center it's what they use to develop these proofs of concepts and integrations and
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:58.140]   tests and you can use it too which is so cool the ATC is a research and testing
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:02.740]   lab that brings together technologies from leading OEMs like VMware more than
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:07.780]   half a billion dollars in equipment invest in the lab I'm old enough to
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:12.140]   remember when ZD net used to have that beautiful lab in Foster City but the
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:15.780]   magazines they're not there anymore they're not doing the testing thank goodness
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:20.980]   worldwide technologies jumped into the fray and created this own which is a by
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:25.940]   the way the nicest lab I've ever seen rack upon rack of amazing equipment and
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:31.900]   you can use it to hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs like Tanzu mission
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:37.700]   control VMware cloud foundation workspace one NSX T carbon black and
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:41.540]   velocle out just a small number of the VMware labs representing the newest
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:47.700]   advances in digital transformation other labs in the ATC represent all I'm
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.740]   just all the stuff you'd want to know about multi cloud architecture that's
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:55.820]   hard to do but you can try it out in the lab security networking primary and
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:04:00.700]   secondary storage data analytics AI they're even up on the latest technologies
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.060]   like DevOps and agile they can help you with that too
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:09.140]   WWT's engineers and partners use the ATC to quickly spin up proofs of concept
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:13.840]   and pilots so that you can confidently select the best solutions and with the
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.460]   ATC you don't have to you know it's getting line you can test out your own
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:23.060]   products and solutions before you go to market not just tests not this labs but
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:27.620]   technical articles expert insights demonstration videos white papers all
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:32.060]   the tools you need to stay up with the latest technology completely virtual you

[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.700]   it's a it's a party if you're not in the discard you don't have a gift what do
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:51.140]   you do what you like to get in there you get to use the gifts it is and a
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:56.380]   man gives baby actually Evan essence is saying try capture one it is also M1
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:01.460]   native I've been using that on my laptop and I you know you get used to
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:05.300]   Lightroom and how it works you kind of don't want to change I'm a little dog I
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.700]   am going to give it a new spin because somebody a lot of people have been
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:12.060]   telling me that so I'll give it a try it's it's not cheap it's I have to say
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.540]   the other thing to consider there's some really good kind of Apple native
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:21.460]   stuff like affinity photo that really is pretty impressive or pixel-made or
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:27.660]   photo that's very well pixel-made or on the Mac is very impressive and is also in
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:31.660]   one native and has more Mac ish maybe affinity is doing some amazing stuff it's
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.940]   serif software to do some amazing stuff so there's some Apple stuff you know
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:40.940]   Apple specific stuff that's very good too I don't I think we actually are in a
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:47.260]   kind of a boom time for photo software because there's different kinds of you
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:52.060]   know some photographers just want Instagram style filters some people want
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:57.740]   like complete control of Lutz and I want every layer and I want histograms for
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.220]   every color and and and you get your choice nowadays there's some really good
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:06.300]   stuff out there it's one of those things you just I'm cracked out in the system
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:12.020]   I've spent so much money right I've got my my my Photoshop and my Lightroom are
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:16.980]   not human base like my preset list is like a dinosaur Roman Earth like it just
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:20.460]   destroys everything I don't know if I could port it to anything else well you
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:24.340]   probably can't know all the tricks and trades so it's it's an investment uncle
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:29.140]   Lee I spent too much money I know well not just money brain cycles yeah you
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:33.180]   know I mean you I could do I could do I could do with my eyes closed I just
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.700]   whip this thing out everything's already all set up I'll look at that I'm just
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:40.540]   a clicking and a whizzing and you know being comfortable but it is nice to try
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:43.420]   that that's not a stream deck what it or is it a stream deck what is that it's
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:48.820]   a it's the Luke deck it's like a stream deck yeah yeah but it's for photography
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:54.700]   videography nice stuff nice program do whatever blah blah blah let's talk
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:09:01.380]   about this I don't know is this a new story to me it kind of is this long
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:07.340]   tweet storm from Patrick McGee Patrick is a San Francisco current
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:12.180]   respondent for the Financial Times he knows and writes about ad tech and I
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:16.100]   think in some ways this might go under the radar because it does require kind
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:22.460]   of an intimate knowledge of ad tech and how it works but it is kind of I think
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:27.500]   damning it's an unredacted complaint from the state attorneys general this is
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:31.180]   was filed back in December it was the first time we've seen it without any
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:38.140]   redactions fact if you want to see how much was redacted anything purple has
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:45.020]   now been unredacted and it's a lot of stuff but and I don't know if any of you
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:51.140]   have read this yet but it's really sounds like Google has been with full
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:56.700]   knowledge of its illegality colluding with Facebook and others to completely
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:06.060]   own the online ad tech market any thoughts Lou you get you is this something I mean
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:12.460]   it's it's kind of beyond my pay grade so I'll be on mine too yeah way beyond mine
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:18.300]   all right so I'll just chime in here please Connor you know you must explain
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:24.020]   yes so Google makes something like hundred and eighty two billion dollars a
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:28.700]   year the most of that money is made from advertising yeah it ain't from search
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:34.580]   it ain't from Gmail it's from ads correct now ads on all of those services
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:39.500]   which each have a billion plus users right so that's a lot of eyeballs that
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:47.420]   you're getting your ads in front of and what the lawsuit the unredacted lawsuit
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.420]   again this is what the state attorney generals it's led by Texas and there's
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:55.900]   like 12 or 14 other states I think you said have joined them I don't know the
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:01.020]   exact number but it's a lot at least a dozen other states have said that Google
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:06.100]   is manipulating the ad network in a variety of ways first to give preference
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:11.420]   sometimes to Facebook Facebook and Google according to some of these documents
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:16.220]   apparently didn't like the fact fact that Apple was trying to make sure you
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.820]   didn't know who their users were and protect their privacy well when you're
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:24.820]   targeting ads and targeted ads are you get a much higher premium when the ad is
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:29.860]   targeted then if I just show you an ad for a Home Depot or something random you
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.340]   know that you might not be interested in so targeted ads means that I need to
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:38.420]   know who you are then or you know have a sense of who you are using all of these
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:42.180]   metrics that these various companies Facebook Google and others use and so
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:45.580]   they didn't like the fact that Apple was really putting user privacy first
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:50.860]   Google and Facebook and so they were trying to figure out ways to have
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:56.420]   Facebook show more ads according to the state attorney generals of course Google
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.740]   Facebook and the companies are gonna have to defend this and the other thing
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.540]   that these documents say and again I encourage people to read them I'm only
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:10.860]   scam them is that Google gave preference to its own ad it would bid on its own
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:16.140]   exchanges and it won a lot of its own ad business itself on an exchange that
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:23.220]   over which it has monopoly power it sets the price for what you know if you're
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.500]   a small business you want to put an ad on the Google ad network it decides how
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:31.740]   much it's going to charge you a cut of your ad sales and so it charges people
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:36.140]   a lot of money and basically you know game the system to its advantage this is
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:39.580]   what the attorney generals are saying and that's what will be debated it's
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:44.460]   misusing its monopoly power in the ad market of which it is the primary
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:51.940]   beneficiary I found a stat that like 75% of all online ad oppressions in the US
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:56.300]   during the third quarter were served by Google that's how powerful it is Google
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:13:04.380]   Google processes 11 billion online ad spaces every day 11 billion ads a day is
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:09.980]   that I mean it's dramatic the complaint alleges and I think it's I think after
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:14.580]   reading it it might be a fair allegation that essentially because Google owns
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:20.940]   both the buy side and sell side on this that they are effectively says the
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:27.180]   clay pitcher batter and umpire all at the same time they quote a Google employee
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:31.140]   who admitted if the analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the stock
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:37.220]   exchange they are both buying and selling and they're controlling the bidding to
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:42.780]   end up in their favor and the only reason that they've dialed in Facebook is
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:48.420]   because they can make more money there's according to this again this is all
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.580]   allegations from the states Attorney General but I think quite well documented
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:57.860]   Google has a secret deal with Facebook they call it Jedi blue they knew was so
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:01.380]   illegal that it has a whole section describing how they'll cover for each
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:07.740]   other if anyone finds out furthermore they have a team called G trade that is
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:14.020]   dedicated to add market manipulation Google remember we were all upset about
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:18.580]   Google amp Google said well we'll we'll you know this is all about making the
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:23.260]   web a better place all the JavaScript has to come from our servers all the ads
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:27.940]   have to come from us all the all the content will will serve so it's faster
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:32.340]   just makes the web faster that's all we're interested in but amp was really
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:37.660]   about preventing people from circumventing Google's ad exchanges amp in fact
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:42.980]   didn't always make things faster only made them the median of sites faster but
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:47.380]   they really pressured and I bet you've seen it has amp content they really
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.260]   pressured the publishers to support amp
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:54.980]   absolutely yeah yeah sure it is with the promise that you would do better on
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:58.980]   search results and you'd be faster and your customers would be happier your
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:03.660]   readers would be happier but really it turns out at least according to this that
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.940]   it was mostly just about making sure that you were locked in that everybody
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:15.140]   was locked in and it's not just bad for it's it's it's not just bad for other
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:18.660]   ad companies it's bad for small businesses that are gonna end up paying
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:22.780]   more and getting less from the ads they buy you know it doesn't and I think one
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:27.060]   of the reasons is gonna be difficult is it's hard to show consumer harm it's a
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:33.060]   more nebulous thing but well the consumer harm is if they charge more for ads and
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:36.980]   companies have to pay for those ads the cost of doing business always gets
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:41.780]   passed on to the consumer in the long run yeah so yeah that's the answer there
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:48.700]   so this is I mean you know a lot of the complaints about big tech I think are
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:53.740]   misguided have to do with bias or perhaps big tech stirring up extremism
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:58.660]   things like that but this one is a little more concrete and a little more clear
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:05.140]   and I think also a little more prosecutable under antitrust law this this seems to
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:11.940]   me and I'm no lawyer a clear violation of the law and it also brings to mind the
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:22.580]   question is this do no evil motto of Google genuine or a marketing to say
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:26.500]   what I'm offended by I just looked in the corner book of America here thank you
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:34.220]   for checking yes you're you're you name the thing Jedi blue you have a
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:37.940]   thing that says do no harm and then you pick the most positive fighting force
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:42.940]   in our universe to call your secret evil plot they should go to jail just for
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:47.980]   that just for that somebody needs to go to jail but I will remind you in the
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.420]   cool world I'm sorry that I'm yelling because this kind of thing always makes
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:54.500]   me very upset because we all know what's gonna happen very very rich people pay a
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:58.500]   very very heavy fine which is pennies to their pocket related to me getting a
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.540]   speeding ticket or a tent ticket fifty seven dollars it's an annoyance but I
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:06.940]   pay it and I move on they're going to get fine for this because this is
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:11.220]   something they cannot escape of collusion and it does do bad things
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:17.020]   directly but I don't think it's going to end and or stop with the government
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:20.540]   doing anything about it I think it finds I don't think this is
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:24.860]   finable I think you for instance and this is to this is the kind of collusion
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:30.220]   antitrust law specifically addresses Facebook and Google didn't want to
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:34.740]   compete with Facebook over ads the other big ad market right so they built a
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:40.780]   moat by collaborating instead Facebook and Google and this in this indictment
[01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:46.220]   allegedly agreed on quotas or complaint not a diamond and for how often Facebook
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.660]   would win for how often Facebook would win auctions the publisher's auctions
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:56.060]   literally manipulating the auction with minimum spends and quotas for how often
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:01.700]   Facebook would bid and win so they got together this is directly in violation
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:05.980]   of any trust law and colluded to dominate the market they said all right
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:10.820]   you're gonna take this we'll take that we'll split up the world that is very
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:15.500]   clearly bad behavior I don't think a fine is gonna I don't know what else you
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:19.460]   can do but I don't know if I is gonna handle it I hope that you're correct and
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:23.540]   that would be great if it happens but I'll also remind you that I watch people
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:28.020]   in politics ask about fenced up 32 times when they couldn't understand
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:32.820]   explanation so them understanding the technology and how to fix it that's a
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:37.060]   large ask Uncle Leo and hopefully you're right that they do fix it I would agree
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:42.020]   with you it's a real issue that things like does Facebook create extremism
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:45.140]   that's gonna be very difficult for Congress to deal with it's a very
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:51.060]   complicated issue and and there's evidence on both sides and I don't I and
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:55.780]   that requires some deep technological understanding I think these guys are
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:19:00.100]   understand business and they understand collusion and they understand
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:06.100]   ad markets that's not technology that's kind of basic economics and I think I
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:09.660]   think you could count on Congress to understand this issue it's not Congress
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:13.740]   this is gonna go to the courts the courts will decide on a remedy I don't
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:19.660]   know what remedy maybe you know you get you get a quarter pointed person
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:23.620]   ombudsman representing the people inside or something that's what they did with
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:30.860]   Microsoft I don't know it's but this is bad behavior let me just very bad it
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:36.420]   does some evil it does do some evil and I think it's very clear you know you could
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:41.340]   point to it it's a lot harder to say well you know is face did Facebook pull
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:46.780]   down enough COVID-19 stories to really I mean that's hard that's a all that's
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:51.780]   very subjective and it's and it's a judgment call but this is pretty darn
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:56.860]   clear it's a very interesting complaint I think one of the one other big thing
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.460]   is that you know they're gonna be dragged through the mud here right so I
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:02.820]   think that's one of the big things the AG wants to do here is he wants to make
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:06.820]   their business public yeah wants to make their financial data their user data
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:10.300]   they're you know all that public right I think that's what's really gonna hurt
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:16.060]   Google in the long run even if they win the case so public opinion right but at
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:21.340]   the same time aren't we all dependent on these companies like you can tell
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:25.180]   everybody how evil Facebook is but nobody's gonna but my grandma's on there
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:29.780]   it's free I don't pay for free that's the biggest thing they got called for
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:34.540]   themselves Google's free I use Google Docs my kids are using in the school if
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:37.980]   they if Google shut down tomorrow my child would not be educated for the next
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:41.700]   three years I don't know what they do like exactly been there Microsoft
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:47.580]   has woman never know that's the point they are so woven into the fabric of our
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:52.020]   society and we love them you know I've just finished Brad Stone's book Amazon
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:57.700]   Unbound the second volume of his and it's really great stuff and it is
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:02.660]   somewhat of an indictment of Amazon and particularly Jeff Bezos but I still love
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:08.180]   Amazon and I'm never gonna stop it they have they and we love them even more
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:12.580]   because of how they you know kept us going during the pandemic these companies
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:16.740]   are so woven into society and we are so reliant on them I don't see a huge
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:22.500]   consumer backlash it's appalling it's shameful but I'm not gonna stop using
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:30.020]   Google Connie what he was not losing you know I I sat through the Microsoft
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:36.340]   anti-trust theory when was that 20 something years ago yeah yeah and the
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:40.540]   thing I mean I'm a tech user you're all tech users we love our tech and you're
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:44.940]   right there's a lot of great things that come out of using these services and they
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:49.660]   have made our lives very different I love that I can Skype with my kids around
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:54.420]   the world and it costs me nothing right it's amazing what you can do but I think
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:22:00.940]   you know I lose point about PR you know how in every James Bond movie the
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:04.780]   villains you know how their secret layer layer and they're like hundreds of
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:09.020]   people sitting at these little terminals typing and they go home at night and
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:12.500]   like hey what happened today oh the secret British agent came in and blew
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:18.060]   up the facility I guess I got a good job right like at some point these people
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:23.820]   who are maximizing profit are putting profit ahead of principal or people I
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:26.620]   mean that's what happened with Microsoft what were they are trying to do
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:31.940]   they were trying to macro maximize profit right and ethics we're not part of the
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:36.140]   discussion and that's what we're seeing here I think to a certain extent or
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:40.300]   certainly with Facebook and how it's oh we can make money you know selling
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:43.900]   Cambridge and a lot of good data about users and its money right like it doesn't
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:47.180]   make a difference who were selling it to or what the ramifications of it are
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:51.980]   we're making money and Google oh we have an ad network let's optimize how we make
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:58.940]   money at some point that has to has to come into consideration for the people
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:03.700]   that work there because we're seeing employees become much more activist about
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:07.700]   the companies we work they work for which is why you had a Facebook whistleblower
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:13.260]   go to Congress with all of these documents but I just think that you know
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:18.220]   those those people who work in these you know factories at some point have to
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:22.060]   say wait a minute you know the British is secret agent just blew it up what am I
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:27.500]   doing here and I hope that it's a moment of reckoning I mean people will come and
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:32.140]   go right we're looking at the trial of Elizabeth Holmes right now in Theranos
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:36.900]   which he's done sure it's you know she did something wrong but she's not the
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:41.660]   first person to to game what her company was doing I mean we can go to uber and
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:46.300]   lots of other companies it's that kind of behavior that somehow is conflated
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:54.500]   with you know American capitalism and played a win move fast break things and
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:24:00.740]   we honor we celebrate these entrepreneurs Elon Musk gonna lie all he wants and we
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:07.580]   still you know hey look at that you just put a guy in the orbit you make a
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:11.300]   really good point though there is a shift in power in the pyro dynamic because
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:15.660]   engineers now are so valuable and so important to these companies that when
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:20.660]   an engineer says hey I don't like what we're doing here the companies can't
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:27.020]   ignore that and that is a big change right that is definitely where a lot of
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:31.580]   this stuff has come to the fore in the past few years is employees exposing and
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:37.700]   bringing documents have we ever seen that before I mean I think you know it there
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:43.020]   was activism you know in the Ford plants in the 20s and they were able to shut it
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:47.060]   down and bring in the Pinkerton's and beat some people up the problem is that
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:52.780]   employees in an assembly line were kind of interchangeable they didn't have that
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:57.620]   power but engineers are not interchangeable they're of scarce resource
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:04.460]   Lou see I mean I am I am pessimistic that it'll change anytime soon but Lou what
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:09.740]   do you think you're a he's an engineer and you do I mean do you do you feel like
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:13.180]   do you see the engineers around you feeling a little more empowered like a
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:17.060]   little more that you know I mean it happened to Microsoft said they said we
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:22.780]   don't didn't they say we don't want to do government contracts I yeah I mean
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:27.220]   that's that's a big thing actually there's a lot of engineers you don't want to
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:32.140]   work for the engineers yeah yeah right I mean that in fact I think they do feel
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:36.620]   empowered I think there's a lot of movements that are now you know starting
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:41.580]   from you know engineers who say hey look I'm important to and you know and
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:44.860]   what I work on I want to know what I work on and I want to know where it goes
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:48.860]   and you know I'm going to make sure that my organization feels that way too and
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:52.300]   I you're starting you starting to see this a lot just happens in Google happens
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.700]   at Facebook it happens in Microsoft you know and I'm starting to see this even
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:00.420]   more and more in the industry so I you know I definitely feel like we you know
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:04.460]   alone feel more empowered only because like you said organizations depend on
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:08.580]   us you know it's not going to be the salespeople they're going to build the
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:12.180]   software and you're not widgets anymore you're not somebody on an assembly line
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:19.780]   screwing in a doorknob you are all precious little unique snowflakes one of
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:24.540]   a guy that we are and hard to come by you know this is this talent is really
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:28.380]   hard to come by that I don't I can't think of another time when workers
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:31.780]   individually had kind of that kind of power I could you know workers have
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:35.300]   organized that's the union movement in the country and so forth but I can't
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.180]   think of another time when workers individuals have been able to do this
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:41.740]   kind of whistleblowing and it's really changed things quite a bit thanks
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:47.020]   Susan Fowler and what she did at uber exactly that we're now seeing that
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:51.660]   transformative yeah yeah an apple is the same they're in the midst of a
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:57.260]   yeah yeah yeah it takes a lot of courage though and I think actually give
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:00.740]   these people you know a lot of props for the amount of courage it takes to say
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:04.420]   you know what I'm gonna throw myself on under the bus just to make a difference
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:08.300]   I mean especially the recent one with Facebook is you know I'm gonna throw
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.300]   myself under the bus because I work for this company for a long time and it's
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:15.020]   it's altered its paradigm and it's in what it does at the company and I don't
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:18.100]   like it and I don't want to do it anymore I'm gonna go and make a difference
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.700]   here and I'm gonna throw myself under the bus it's interesting these are all
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:26.020]   women I don't we're maybe us guys we're just gonna keep our head down and work I
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:31.140]   don't know but thank goodness is women standing up and saying no this this

[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:52.660]   this is kind of pathetic it's like oh well maybe if we change the name nobody
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:59.540]   will notice um really i get i mean and apparently
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.820]   this isn't the first time they've considered it at one point uh
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:07.060]   they're they're according to uh case you do not platformer
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:10.340]   there was thoughts about changing the corporate name to something like fb
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:15.940]   incorporated or in all caps Facebook corporation
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:20.820]   uh apparently this was uh casey talked to Antonio Lucio who's the company's
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:26.180]   former chief marketing officer that was overruled but now the company
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:31.780]   and pretty really mark are kind of eyeing the next thing for Facebook the
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:36.900]   metaverse and maybe this new name will be metaverse do you have any inside
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:39.860]   reporting on this connie what are they up to
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:44.420]   no i mean we we don't know the inside reporting casey broke that story
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:47.860]   i think it's really interesting that they think that a name change will
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:51.220]   pass for a race pay no attention someone told me that
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:54.020]   and said are they gonna change your name and i was like to what face plant
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:58.820]   i mean i think what they did uh face palm i love it
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:04.260]   there you go there you go um so it's going to be really interesting
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:08.740]   uh obviously if they do change the name maybe just like you said go to their
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:16.020]   initials fb but it doesn't fool anybody i don't know if it's like alphabet
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:19.060]   where they said we have so many things we're doing
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:21.780]   uh people think it was this google but it's more than google so we're going to
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:24.740]   call it alphabet i don't think at the time that was to deflect
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:29.220]   criticism it was just a corporate you know i think it was probably about
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:33.860]   getting larry and serge moved out of google as much as anything
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:38.020]   could it be mark is saying i want to spend more time with my money
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:43.540]   um is a new structure for face no one caught no one calls it the alphabet
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:47.460]   no everybody calls it google we still call it google yeah and and no one's
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:52.420]   gonna call it the metaverse do you not read dc comics metaverse is taken brosive
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:56.100]   like a flash batman superman like we already got a metaverse you know what
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:37:00.020]   i mean like we we've got the multiverse like all the verses are taken
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:05.540]   but common book superheroes right now the metaverse is from science fiction
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:08.500]   i'll do the definition we finally came up with on twig
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:11.220]   uh the first uh appearance of the metaverse to my
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:15.220]   memory is uh Neil Stevenson's snow crash which has this
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:18.420]   virtual reality world indistinguishable from the real world
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:22.340]   you can go into everybody else is in there you could do things you can
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:27.300]   socialize you can work you can play uh more recently uh
[01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:31.060]   Neil uh let's see it was Neil Stevenson then William Gibson with
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:34.900]   neuromancer where they jacked in and they entered this cyber
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:37.780]   cyberspace he was the first to use that phrase
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:41.460]   uh most most recently ready player one uh where
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:46.020]   you know the world is so dystopian so hideous so awful by the way that's
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:49.860]   often a kind commitment with the metaverse is you don't want to be in real
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:52.820]   life so come into this virtual world where it's
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:58.180]   everything's much happier um technical answer i mean but when i say
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:01.140]   Mustang most people think of a car if i don't even think of a horse anymore
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:06.340]   okay like well the metaverse well second life right
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:10.340]   did were you ever in second life oh man was i a second life second
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:15.620]   life i thought you might be i never had yeah i was i made so much money on
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:18.820]   second what i can't tell you how do you make money
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:22.580]   you are so good at making money on the silliest things how do you make money
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:25.540]   in second life people ask real time how come i don't work for a living because
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:27.940]   working for cycles i'm trying to float free through life
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:32.580]   anyway second life was making mansions close
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:36.100]   and people would buy these virtual goods oh yeah
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:39.780]   losers that couldn't make their own outfits i was just picking these things
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:43.220]   all i could make 13 and five minutes and i was just selling them for 20
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:47.940]   dollars would you get second life would you get second life money or real money
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:55.060]   real money cash linden bucks you i look i'm just
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:58.740]   sad second life fell off the horse is all i'm saying no they're still right
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:02.340]   except not like it was it's not it's mostly weird sex parties i think
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:05.620]   because you can isn't it you can buy like strange
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:10.500]   same new like nude costumes when i when i was in there i was making dinosaurs
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:14.260]   and horse people i don't know what's going on in there now i
[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:19.060]   i love the situation no that was actually that was an early
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:21.860]   you know we talked now about virtual goods and fortnight
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:24.580]   which is a multi-billion dollar business uh
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:29.220]   the second life predated that didn't they yeah yeah i mean and and it was
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:32.980]   again i get what they're trying to do with the meta thing but it doesn't
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:35.220]   matter everybody's still going to call it facebook
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.900]   like well name changing is not going to help you anything
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:43.860]   out of the big tobacco playbook right in fact a lot of people
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:49.540]   likened facebook to big tobacco lately uh philip morris when it got really
[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:53.700]   it was kind of hot to be a cigarette company rebranded itself to
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:59.780]   altria right who remembers altria nobody nobody i
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:04.420]   tell morris rings in my mind quickly again yeah i didn't yeah
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:10.740]   uh they made marlboro um they are altria now i don't know if that's
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:14.500]   you know that saved them from you know uh
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:18.820]   any uh acrimony about what their products did to people
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:24.100]   um any suggestions for what facebook might call itself any thoughts
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:31.380]   i think they're just trying to protect their brand right and
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:34.580]   they're already seeing a hit from all of this
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:37.300]   you know bad stuff that's coming out of facebook all the time
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:41.860]   against instagram and what's app so maybe they're going to go the alphabet
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:46.100]   right make themselves a holding company and rebrand
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:50.580]   uh the platform so that you're not on facebook now you're on metaverse
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:54.580]   well you be on facebook by metaverse right or because instagram it says
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:58.980]   instagram by facebook now so maybe by whatever this
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:03.700]   vladsvov at bloomberg says facebook appears to control meta
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:08.340]   dot com so maybe meta
[01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:13.300]   maybe meta um the original story is broken in the
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:19.220]   verge uh the author uh he said uh that he thought maybe
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:22.500]   Verizon i mean sorry not Verizon that's taken isn't it
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:26.020]   how about oh is anybody used those like how about
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:31.780]   horizon because uh there was a facebook app facebook meets roblox app
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:35.620]   the company's been working on for years called horizon worlds
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:41.140]   so maybe horizon sounds like i'm going to a hospital to talk to my grandma on
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:44.740]   facebook yeah it does actually sound like a
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:47.780]   place you get a euthanized come to her right all of our
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:51.620]   reaction just tells it yeah literally all the four of us are just like
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:55.220]   the app what the hell right it can't be any worse than
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:57.620]   trunk
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:01.140]   you never know they might surprise me because it's wrong
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:07.700]   trunk yeah um maybe just case he says you could
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:13.060]   they used to be the facebook then made it facebook what if you just call it the
[01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:17.060]   the definite article i don't know well i think we'll find out this week

[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:25.300]   leaning away from meta as the name another told me the new name might not
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:29.940]   relate to the metaverse at all both sources suggested zuckerberg is
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:34.100]   keen for the new name to surprise to be something

[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:14.180]   great article thank you katie for letting us
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:19.460]   steal your jokes i would call it uh olympus encyclopedia
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.260]   olympus library something like with books
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:25.940]   alix's entry yeah like something like that with library
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:28.980]   like you know presence always get a library when they get out like just name
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:33.140]   it sucker no though you know that facebook is
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:35.940]   probably hired not one but several rebranding companies there's
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:39.460]   companies specialize coming up with names like altria
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:42.820]   uh and they get and about what happens is and and no matter what they pick it's
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:45.540]   gonna be terrible it's gonna be guaranteed it's gonna be
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:50.980]   terrible i could bet on that they still used to work for the local
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:54.900]   developer here uh they wanted a rebrand
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:59.700]   and uh they wanted to tie into petaluma so they called i can't remember what it
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:03.780]   was they called it something and and barely they weren't from the
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:06.180]   branding company wasn't from the local company because when they came back and
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:09.780]   they had a big unveiling every said no no that's that's where the dumps are
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:12.900]   you know you don't want to name your development company
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:17.700]   for the dumps so they end up naming it basin street which is i remember i think
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:20.820]   isn't in new warland so i don't i think these branding companies aren't
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:24.820]   necessarily the what was uh twits name before twit was always
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:28.100]   old was the revenge of the screen savers
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:32.020]   okay but then we got a cease and desistler so we
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:36.740]   we knew we couldn't name it that uh
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:41.540]   20 years ago today steve jobs taught the band to play
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:49.060]   put a thousand a thousand songs in our pocket and konnie you were at that event
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:55.380]   i was it was uh it was a notable day not just because steve jobs was really
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:46:00.020]   good at doing presentations and keeping the audience
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.900]   enthralled but because it was such a big risk
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:07.540]   for apple at the time it was primarily known as the maker of the makantash
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:10.740]   and it was two thousand and one so jobs had been back
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:14.660]   five years and they were still you know in financial struggles they had had the
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:18.180]   new candy colored i-max before but they still you know
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:22.100]   weren't you know solvent i would say they were they were still struggling to
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:25.860]   make money so for them to take a risk on the
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:29.780]   consumer electronics market was a big move and
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:35.700]   um jobs started out his pitch that day with an emotional appeal
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:40.180]   which was everybody's into music this is a market that's never going to go away
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:43.700]   people love music we love music and you should do what you love
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:48.180]   and he really did a good job of keeping the audience
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:50.740]   you know following along with him and his logic
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:54.660]   um there were other music players on the market apple is typically not the
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:58.900]   first into a new space but he sold them on how it was going to be
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:02.020]   apple was going to make it elegant and easy and
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:07.460]   really fast to upload music um to this you know
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:12.100]   very cool looking device i mean i have to admit this is my original ipot i got
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:17.060]   it that day it's in pretty good shape not because apple gave away a case i
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:20.740]   actually asked jobs about that i said have you have you thought about
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:23.780]   making cases and he said what for it fits in your pocket
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:27.220]   and i was wearing a skirt with no pockets and i'm like because some of us carry
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:30.500]   stuff in our bags so i went home and i sewed my
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:34.820]   own little case i found it oh it's a little cow
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:39.940]   it's a gateway case with uh with yarn for my kids
[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:45.460]   uh you know plaything and that's what's kept this thing in pristine condition but
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:49.860]   it was a notable moment like i said it was a risk it did it take a while for the
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:52.980]   ipot to be a success i don't think people realized that it was not an
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:56.340]   instant hit they it took them four or five years
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:48:00.420]   to really sell in the millions of devices but by then
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:03.700]   they'd introduced the itunes store and had taken on the
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:07.140]   music labels as all of us recall it was one of steve jobs
[01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:10.740]   famous open letters to the industry and talking about why you should be able to
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:15.140]   buy songs individually rather than buying a whole CD
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:19.140]   and uh it was just cool right the silhouette ads they had a
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:23.860]   u2 ipod a bono was there for the launch of that i actually got to meet bono on the
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:28.260]   edge of that day very cool and there was a lot of
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.540]   there was a lot of good marketing hype and of course a thousand songs in your
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:36.260]   pocket was quite a great tagline so it was we still
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:40.180]   remember it and of course it's like trivial to put a thousand sons in your
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:43.140]   pocket now what is on your uh what is on your
[01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:45.940]   ipod is did you have the original music still on there
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:51.140]   i do uh jobs gave away 20 albums and so everybody in the audience had to go
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:54.260]   home with the shopping bag with all the CDs otherwise it would have been
[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:57.140]   music piracy right oh you're kidding to get them
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:01.780]   so i have all 20 and i wrote a story about it on cnad you can see a photo but
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:04.980]   um there were a couple of beetles hard days night
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:09.780]   abby road there was two simon and girth uncle this is geeve jobs playlist and so
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:12.980]   cnad put together a spotify playlist if you want to hear it all
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:17.940]   uh yo yo ma glenn gold bb king uh of course bob dylan it
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:23.300]   you know jobs is into dylan um just uh sarah mclaughlin
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:27.940]   um was the first bit of music played and the thing that i remember about that
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:30.900]   event aside from people going well that's kind of cool
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:34.580]   yeah and they had firewire which was their fast
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:38.260]   file transfer standard i still have the firewire
[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:41.140]   i cave yeah you and i both in order to charge it
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:46.500]   had a firewire firewire and the firewire official apple firewire
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:52.340]   charging brick wow um it was fast watching him load
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:57.620]   music off of his he had a mac uh you know computer on stage and then
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:50:02.820]   you had to rip the CDs and then into iTunes and then you had to connect it
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:05.860]   to your computer and then you had to copy it over
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:10.020]   synchronize it over and it was carefully done so that you couldn't easily
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:13.860]   steal the songs later but it was also auto sync
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:16.900]   which was very cool right rip a lot of music and if you
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:20.580]   you know if you ripped ten CDs on tuesday and then you
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:24.580]   went back on friday and you ripped others it it knew that um
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:27.780]   you know what to sync up was which is something that we take for granted now
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:31.940]   but that was a big deal in those days honestly and
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:35.700]   yeah it was the start of apple moving into this consumer electronic space
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:40.580]   and it was cemented in 2007 obviously when they introduced the iPhone
[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:44.500]   a lot of people don't maybe not remember this but on the day they introduced
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:48.180]   the iPhone we've had the iPod and all the iterations the
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:53.220]   iPhone kind of subsumes the iPod right because the iPhone is a phone and
[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:57.460]   it's a music player as well and that was the day that jobs changed the name of
[01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:01.060]   the company from apple computer ink to apple ink
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:03.540]   in recognition that was when that happened.
[01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:08.100]   Yeah on the day they introduced the iPhone not the iPhone. Oh yeah the iPhone yeah
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:11.620]   yeah so it was the start of that whole path and of course
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:15.620]   two trillion dollar evaluation later it was obviously the right
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:20.580]   was the right call. Yeah this was before the iPhone this was
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:25.300]   the most successful consumer product of all time I think I mean it really
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:28.820]   was dominant. You know I have one story that I wanted to tell and that is
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:32.980]   and no disrespect to Microsoft here but at some point I you know speaking at an
[01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:38.980]   event and someone gave me a zoom and I still have the zoom it still powers up
[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:44.100]   but I came home and I had two kids and I gave my daughter
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:48.740]   you know this iPod to use and I gave my son the zoom. Did he say why do you hate
[01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:52.020]   me mom? Did you love do you love Laura?
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:56.740]   That's really lovely. So you can have a zoom. We had to
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:02.580]   we had to go to an iPod after that so a shuffle by the way that that was the
[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:08.260]   years of the iPod shuffle even smaller with more capacity. Yeah. Anyway yeah.
[01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:12.180]   How many iPods I mean we all have owned probably
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:17.380]   most of them. I even bought my sister the U2 the black and red U2
[01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:22.260]   iPod was loaded with U2 albums. I come to think of it there's been a
[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:26.980]   long heritage of love between Apple and Bono for some reason I'm not sure I
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:31.140]   really understand that. Well it wasn't just the U2.
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:34.820]   Everyone loves Bono. Yeah. It wasn't just the U2
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:40.340]   iPod it was the first time that Bono and U2 had licensed their music digitally.
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:44.180]   Right. Big deal. Unlike a lot of musicians they owned a catalog.
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:48.100]   So that's why it was a big deal. That was a big deal getting them to say okay you
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:53.140]   can sell it digitally. Remember that? God people for it's moved so fast you
[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:57.780]   forget bands did not allow digital copies of their music.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:01.620]   They were terrified by the whole thing. Napster boy.
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:05.860]   Lime wire. Yeah. This was good old the other thing that
[01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:12.020]   is I mean this was a early MP3 player. This was for a car obviously.
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:17.140]   But this is a laser disc was an ATRA hard drive in it.
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:22.420]   This is a Rio. That's a Rio. Exactly. And I had the little small portable Rio as
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:25.940]   well the diamond Rio that was predated the iPod.
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:30.020]   But the thing that all of these did wrong. We even did many shows on the
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:33.700]   screensavers about building your own. Put a computer in your trunk.
[01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:39.220]   And MP3 is on a hard drive. But the thing was hard about all these is
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:43.940]   navigation. It was miserable. Finding your music and playing it was miserable.
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:49.540]   And it was a brilliant insight. Tony Fadel came up with the designer of
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:54.100]   the iPod to have that that click wheel. These actually are sold. They actually turn.
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:54:01.460]   But they held up. That click sound is one of the things you could just play.
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:04.500]   You know people will dial up. You know exactly. People know it.
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:07.620]   Yeah. A lot of Britney Spears on this one.
[01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:11.780]   I'm just going to say it must have been my daughters.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:18.580]   Or she was the last one to have it. I'm going to defend the zoom. The first
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:24.820]   brown zoom not great. But at the end of the zoom the zoom HD was actually a really good
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:30.020]   music device. And I was kind of sad that Microsoft having finally perfected that device
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:34.820]   gave up on it. But I was going to say by the time it got good they were already they had
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:40.100]   already lost. Yeah. I guess that's what it was. You couldn't do it. It was too much headwind.
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:45.220]   Yeah. It's funny. There's actually a huge following. If you go check out Reddit there's a huge
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:50.980]   following. People still love that device. The HD. Yeah. I think that was in every
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:56.500]   risk. It was kind of the windows phone of music players because it had a great interface. It had
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:04.900]   a big screen. It was kind of in every way superior to the competition. But it was too late.
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:10.580]   Just like the windows phone. It was it was over. Yeah. I was kind of sad about that.
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:15.060]   Shortly after Microsoft gave up its music you could use to be able to buy music from Microsoft
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:21.140]   and and all of that and they gave up all of that. Hard to believe 20 years ago.
[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:25.460]   And and does your son still think you like your daughter better?
[01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:34.660]   No. He has got we bought him iPhones. Yeah. He's been redeemed. Yeah. That's good.
[01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:40.740]   I'm glad to say we have we talked about this when it happened proton mail got a lot of heat
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:47.140]   for handing over information about one of its customers to the authorities as part of a French
[01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:52.820]   investigation that led to a rest of climate activists. At the time the company said we had to
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:56:00.900]   comply with a Swiss court order to provide data. Of course proton mail became famous for saying
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:06.180]   we will never do that. We you encrypt your mail. No one can read it and we do not keep track of you.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:12.580]   And they took that off the website when that case came out. But the good news is proton has
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:21.060]   appealed and they just won a Swiss court has upheld the appeal of proton limiting its obligation
[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:28.260]   to monitor traffic and retain data for surveillance purposes. So good for proton. I want to give
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:33.140]   them credit because we we bashed them a little bit when they handed that data over understanding
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:37.460]   that you know what if you're in a country you have to obey the laws of the country. I think I bashed
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:42.580]   them more for saying they didn't have to and giving people a false impression that they didn't
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:51.460]   have to. But the good news is they have continued to fight and and they've got what Andy N the CEO
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:58.420]   says was an important first step in their campaign to advance privacy and freedom. So to be fair proton
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:05.300]   mail has fought and won too late for the French climate activists were never heard from again.
[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:13.380]   But uh still that's that's that's good news. I wanted to give them credit. Anybody watching
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:22.020]   the squid game? I watched it. What do you think? I think it's a tale as old as time.
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:31.060]   Oh, oh that's beauty and the beast I think but uh I mean you know rich people you get some poor
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:35.700]   people to do some dangerous things you don't feed them you watch them fight themselves a little bit
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:40.020]   laugh at it all you know what I mean. So I mean then you got the people on the bottom trying to
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:43.540]   scroud anyway they can survive it us a couple organs. I mean I'm not trying to tell the whole
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:48.900]   story but I mean I've heard it before. Yeah we have kind of haven't we it was very valuable it was
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:55.060]   number one show on Netflix by far. In fact it got so popular that the the South Korean
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:58:02.740]   government ISPs asked Netflix to reimburse them for all the bandwidth they had lost from people
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:08.740]   watching squid game. Bloomberg got a hold of something Netflix does not normally reveal
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:13.780]   which it's hard you know because Netflix you pay a subscription fee you don't pay for individual
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:21.060]   things. So it's hard for Netflix to say that anyone show had any particular you can't say we made a
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:29.220]   billion dollars on this but they do measure it assess performance based on how it benefits the
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:34.420]   subscription rate on it and they do have a metric they don't release but they use internally. According
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:42.020]   to Bloomberg who got to see those figures squid game they estimate created 900 million dollars in
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:47.780]   value for the company. It was that successful. That's so astonishing to me and I don't even
[01:58:47.780 --> 01:58:53.460]   believe it but I guess you kind of have to because most people that watch it already have never did
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:58.340]   that many new people buy it because I know that's what I can money off all this merchandise I know
[01:58:58.340 --> 01:59:03.460]   that Halloween everybody gonna have a triangle square circle looking like PlayStation. Oh I know
[01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:06.820]   it's gonna be the costume isn't it it's gonna be the costume. It's gonna be the costume. I think
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:11.380]   PlayStation is out here in the street. I know that but how did Netflix make that much money off
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:16.820]   of subscriptions. I don't believe they to work there's a global market. It's more than new subscriptions
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:23.300]   it's also it makes it sticky so it reduces churn people don't quit. There's a I don't know how they
[01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:28.420]   calculate it but you know obviously it's an imperfect number but I'll give you some numbers that are
[01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:33.940]   that's a heck of a number though. Yeah 132 million people have watched at least two minutes of
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:39.140]   Squid's game in the first 23 days that beats their prior record held by Bridgerton.
[01:59:39.140 --> 01:59:47.620]   111 million people started the show when it came out. 89% of the people who started the show
[01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:54.980]   watched at least 75 minutes that's more than one episode. 68 66% of viewers 87 million people
[01:59:54.980 --> 02:00:02.100]   finished the series in the first three weeks. All told people have spent more than 1.4 billion hours
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:10.180]   watching Squid Game. We're never going to Mars. We're never going to Mars. Whenever I hear things
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:14.420]   like the spools run that much time I know we're never getting off this planet. Where unless aliens
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:18.740]   come down and give us a ride and we got an international intergalactic Uber. We're not going
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:25.540]   nowhere. We ain't gonna make it. So I one thing I will say and I give Netflix credit for is before
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:30.660]   Squid Game we had Bridgerton but do you remember last year everybody was talking about Lupin which
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:37.620]   was this series about a detective in France and it's gotten people to read subtitles.
[02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:45.060]   That's a good point. You can watch international shows in their original language and read the
[02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:51.860]   subtitles which you know if you try to convert it to English it you know it loses its impact.
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:57.780]   For some reason the companies that do the overdubbing but I are the worst actors.
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:04.180]   So if you listen to the overdubbed version it's happened to me a couple of times you might say
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:08.980]   this show is terrible but then turn on the subtitles listen to the actual Korean in this case.
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:14.020]   You can hear the acting it's much it's a 10 times better show. I did notice though there's three
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:19.620]   ways you can see what they're doing. There's overdubbed there's closed captioning and then
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:26.420]   there's the official titles provided by the producer. I tried it all three ways in Squid Game none of
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:31.220]   the three matched. They were saying different things in all three.
[02:01:31.220 --> 02:01:37.700]   They want you to watch it three times. I wish I spoke Korean so I know which one was accurate.
[02:01:37.700 --> 02:01:43.060]   I'd reiterate we are not going to Mars because of man in the stature and time.
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:51.700]   Shouldn't I be buying one for every episode three times? No no I can't. I just do that. Of course.
[02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:57.060]   Few minutes that's all. Actually I'm just going to say the headline is Netflix has people reading
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:03.780]   again. I love it. That's good. See this is why she's editor in chief. Do you do you get to write
[02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:09.620]   headlines? Sometimes I do. There's an art to writing headlines and all of my colleagues know as you
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:14.900]   know and when you can do a really good headline it's very satisfying. You just wrote one like that.
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:19.780]   I impressed. Beautiful. Beautiful. Watch that watch for that next on CNET.
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:25.300]   We've, you know, Jeff Jarvis is a regular on this week in Google. He's a presser. Journalism is,
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:33.540]   he's in certainly knows the ways of the journalism world and always is reminding me don't blame the
[02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:38.420]   writer for the headline. He didn't write that headline. Somebody else wrote it for him.
[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:44.020]   So sometimes I will and I confess I do this. I think everybody does this. I will read the headline
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:50.820]   and think that's the story and it often is not. I'll take one more break and then we'll wrap this up.
[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:56.580]   Because we got a Niners game and Chinese food waiting for me. That's very, very important.
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:03:02.740]   Or should I brought to you by podium? You know, I know there's Chinese food. I got just got a text
[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:12.180]   saying radar, radar service. I love podium. People now, this is the future. I think that the
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:17.300]   pandemic has really changed how we think of, how we think of business, how we want to do business.
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:21.620]   It used to be in the, you know, in, I don't know, the 90s that if you were a business, you had to
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:25.140]   have an email address, then you had to have a webpage. You had it. Remember, you had to have
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:28.500]   an answering machine. If you didn't have an answering machine, that's maybe the 70s or 80s.
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:34.980]   You weren't with it. Nowadays, I think you have to have text messaging. That's how your customers,
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:40.340]   they don't want to call you. They want to text you. That's why local businesses everywhere turning
[02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:46.340]   to podium. It makes every interaction as easy as sending a text. I mean, how often now do we get
[02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:52.420]   texting? Your meal is on the way or you order something and say, okay, curbside pickup in 12
[02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:57.780]   minutes and then you get a text. But more and more, I'll leave the dentist's office. They'll send me
[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:03.540]   a text with my appointment. They'll say, hey, by the way, if you liked our service, rate us on Yelp or
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:10.740]   Google, these things are changing business because it turns out that open rate for text messages is
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:15.860]   almost 100%. That's better than anything else. That's how I want to interact with businesses.
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:20.420]   That's how businesses should interact with their customers. Just podium isn't just a better way
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:24.260]   to communicate. It's a better way to do everything. Whether it's gathering reviews, you can even
[02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:29.460]   collect payments, marketing to your customers. I get a text from our local ice cream parlor. I
[02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:34.820]   hate it, but I get it. They say, hey, you haven't come down in a while. How about 20% off a pint of
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:40.740]   habababa, Robbie Road? And I have to go down there and buy some ice cream. podium makes it all
[02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:45.540]   as easy as pressing send. You won't just free up more time. You'll grow your business. You'll get
[02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:50.660]   more done with podium. You'll close deals with customers before the competition even has a chance

[02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:24.980]   I know and a lot of more small businesses and local businesses because I know because I
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:30.260]   notice now and it really works. It really is a way to engage your customers to involve them.

[02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:57.060]   Side note also, Uncle Leo. Yes. Text messaging is so huge because once someone trusts your brand
[02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:02.980]   or company with their phone number and you do them right, you have direct contact with them
[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:07.380]   for a long time. Look at this guy. He's got his phone number in his head.
[02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:13.620]   Lower third. You text your boy and I'm the one answering. Texting it really like email marketing
[02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:18.180]   all the time. It's intimate. It works like you text messages like people always shocked.
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:21.700]   Like sometimes it takes me a while to get back to you just so you know because it is me. But I do
[02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:26.340]   respond to everybody and reply. And it just when I send something out, people check it because they
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:32.740]   know that it's me sending it. So absolutely right. Yeah, it works. And for those put up the lower
[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:40.740]   third again so I can read the number for those who would like to text on JJ Stone 844 986 4563.
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:46.020]   Feel free to tell me how wrong I am about to m1 chip. I'll be telling myself I'm wrong.
[02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:49.540]   As soon as my max gets in here, as soon as I get the next. Which one did you order? Which one did you
[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:59.380]   order? The match pro 14 inch with 32 gigs of RAM and the price. I tried because I want to get
[02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:03.220]   more RAM and anything I did to make a bill to order. It said you get it November.
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:11.380]   So I said I want the base and that one comes Tuesday. So that's why I got that. So I'd have it
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:16.180]   in hand so I could talk about it sooner. Yeah, I don't mind waiting. I bought the Mac mini. I've
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:22.340]   used it three times. So it's just looking pretty on my desk. I'm just an Adobe guy. So it's hard
[02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:27.540]   for me. But maybe I'll send it to Aunt. He yells at me. Ask me when I don't. I keep trying to give.
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:32.820]   I keep trying to give Aunt Max. He doesn't know. And is very picky. He wants windows. Yeah.
[02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:39.300]   Again, I got a thread ripper with 128 games of RAM down here. This thing is obese. Like I can't
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:46.740]   let it go. Hopefully Apple just laptop may have me when I want to play a Viking survival game. I use
[02:07:46.740 --> 02:08:00.020]   AMD Google and Roku are in it. Fighting YouTube is about to pull all its apps from Roku. They said
[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:05.060]   Thursday they're going to remove YouTube apps from the Roku app store on December 9th. Roku says
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:11.140]   Google asked for preferential treatment. In fact, they've got the smoking gun. They got the emails
[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:16.500]   as a condition to allow YouTube apps on Roku. Google calls those claims. Baseless says it
[02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:23.860]   won't know. We didn't do that. But there a CNBC says we saw a 2019 email from Google to Roku.
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:34.100]   This says we want preferential treatment. So this is going to heat up and CNBC says Congress
[02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:40.260]   might get involved. It's gotten it's gotten that bad. These carriage battles are not
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:49.220]   bad for customers. Why is Roku picking these fights? They're already losing market share to Apple TV
[02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:53.380]   and Google TV. I don't understand why they're picking these fights. They pick the fights that
[02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:57.620]   they're going to lose. Well, okay. So here's what Google sent me. You tell me now if you would
[02:08:57.620 --> 02:09:04.580]   give into this. The email from the Google executive according to CNBC September 2019 reads, quote,
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:10.420]   YouTube position, a dedicated shelf for YouTube search results is a must.
[02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:18.420]   In other words, not just in the YouTube app, but on the Roku front page, we want a YouTube search.
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:27.220]   Would you do that? No, I wouldn't. No, I think it's fair for Roku to say,
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:35.300]   look, we got a platform. You're an app. You're going to be equal with other apps. Don't ask for that.
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:42.020]   I will also say to the YouTube, by the way, Google denises even though that this is the email
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:49.460]   exists. So it's like, come on, guys. And I read earlier, like I love these these Google TV things,
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:56.020]   but I so I have YouTube TV, right? Like that's my TV service I pay for now. And yet still,
[02:09:56.020 --> 02:10:01.620]   on the thing it pops up and tries to get me to buy YouTube TV premium, like every three days,
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:06.260]   I can't figure out how to make it stop. Well, it's why I don't own his Amazon fire because it's
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:11.620]   basically a platform to advertise Amazon Prime screaming everywhere on it. I don't want that.
[02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:16.740]   I just want to I'm like, I'm like, how do you not recognize I'm already giving you $70 a month?
[02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:21.860]   Like I'm not I'm not by YouTube music. I had to I deleted that, but you can't delete YouTube
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:27.860]   because I need YouTube, but they keep so I'm pretty sure they're trying to push it everywhere they
[02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:34.660]   can. So it's one more nailing the coffee for YouTube. Senator Amy Klobuchar sent out a statement on
[02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:39.140]   Thursday for too long big tech platforms have leveraged their power to preference their products
[02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:44.820]   and services over those of thousands of smaller online businesses. David Sisselini, house representatives
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:50.980]   called Google's move a shake down in a tweet on Thursday. So Congress is getting involved.
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:11:00.260]   But I'll tell you who loses they pull YouTube off. Who's the loser? Us. Yeah, us. And that's
[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:04.660]   frustrating to me. These they've got to solve this. These carriage battles are just ugly.
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:14.180]   Not good for anybody. Thank you, John Carmack pushed out a open source version unlocked OS
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:22.180]   for the defunct Oculus go headset. So that's great. Keeps it alive. And that's really fantastic.
[02:11:22.180 --> 02:11:27.060]   It's this, you know, when products like this go, you know, die, you just got, you know, it goes
[02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:32.260]   in the landfill. But now you could put this update on there. It's unlocked. You can do what you want.
[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:39.140]   Gives you full root access. There are more than 2 million Oculus goes out there. So wow. And you do
[02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:45.060]   not have to have a Facebook account to use it now. So thank you, John Carmack. Rock on.
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:54.180]   Congratulations. Microsoft shipped the Android subsystem so that you can now put Android apps
[02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:58.580]   on Windows 11. The store is starting to sell apps. You can get this is the use of the Amazon
[02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:03.540]   store to put the apps up, including the Kindle and other Amazon apps. Well done.
[02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:08.020]   I don't know if you have anything to do with it, Lou. But thank you. I did not have anything to do
[02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:13.780]   with it. But I tell you, one thing is, you know, this is their next step. I think this is the next
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:18.260]   step to show that, you know, the operating system is willing to open the door to other
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:23.300]   developers. I think that's the key. And I did put, yes, I agree. I agree. And I love what they've
[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:30.180]   done with WSL. This is great. It's that's what a real platform is. It's not lock in. It's open up.
[02:12:30.180 --> 02:12:37.220]   Yeah. I put this one story in for you, Owen JJ Stone. All these other stories were for Connie
[02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:43.860]   for Lou. But this one's for you. Do you remember when A&W reacting to the McDonald's quarter
[02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:49.460]   pounder back in the 80s announced a one third pound burger? Do you remember this?
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:58.420]   Except that Americans, not so good at math, wrongly assumed that a quarter pounder one over four
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:03.940]   was bigger than a third pounder one over three. And the whole experiment went down in history
[02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:09.940]   as one of the biggest marketing fails in history. I remember my teacher telling me I'm not always
[02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:15.220]   going to have a calculator in my pocket, but now I got our phones. I'm 13. My teachers were wrong
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:19.620]   about that. But let me divide a third is bigger than a quarter. And then the seven,
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:24.980]   the sort of four of them, right? And then we put in the six and carry one. This is awesome.
[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:31.540]   Point eight is what it's because A&W, which still is a great great makes great root beer, has now
[02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:38.900]   decided to double down on their marketing failure from the 80s. They have now shipped a
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:48.180]   three ninths of a pound burger. And I love this. I believe you can find this quote, quote from them.
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:54.100]   Three ninths of a pound burger. And if they're out of stock on the three ninths of a pound
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:14:08.740]   burger, you could also get. Oh, shoot, I closed the what was it? Oh, let me find it. History. I know,
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:11.700]   I know, I know, I don't know how to use browsers. They said,
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:22.820]   Okay, they're launching. Okay, A&W is launching the three ninth pound burger with a dramatic
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:29.060]   reenactment of the Eureka moment that video featuring a mascot and math prodigy Rudy, the great root
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:35.700]   beer bear solving the unsolvable equation in his studies, a centerpiece of a paid media campaign
[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:42.580]   that will run throughout the program. If supplies, wall supplies laughs, if sold out a two sixth of
[02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:47.940]   a pound burger can be made specially at no extra charge. Thank you very much. Took me a while to
[02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:56.900]   get to that. Can I get one eighth fries with that? Ladies gentlemen, that's made me very hungry,
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:01.300]   which means I think it's time to wrap this puppy up. Thank you so much. Connie, it is really great
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:07.300]   to meet you. You fit in perfectly. I'd love to have you back anytime you want. You can write

[02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:49.940]   got iPods many years ago. Nobody got a zoom. I have to tell you, nobody got a zoom.
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:53.940]   Luma Raska probably still has his zoom. It's so great to have you the host of this week in

[02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:26.180]   I don't know if that counts as a podcast, but okay, maybe the comfiest tech podcast
[02:17:26.980 --> 02:17:32.340]   since 2005. Thank you all for being here. And now ladies and gentlemen, as is tradition.
[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:36.500]   Owen JJ Stone Oh, doctor to close it out. Owen.
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:42.820]   So a great panel today. I learned so much from two smart people. Oh, Leo, you're kind of smart,
[02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:48.900]   too. But I learned some stuff today. So that was really good. You may not have a baby like my
[02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:54.500]   machine at one point to you might not have one of these creations in your life. But I do know
[02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:58.900]   that everybody watching listening has a phone. And so once a year, I usually like to remind people
[02:17:58.900 --> 02:18:03.460]   that have stayed this far. Holidays are coming to world's kind of opening back up. Take out your
[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:10.420]   phone, interview your grandparents, your husband, your wife, your father, for your children. I do
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:14.020]   a show raising an engine with my daughter. And I know people hate because I don't put out episodes.
[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:18.500]   It's my most like thing that I do, but I don't put it out. But I'm going to fix that because
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:24.100]   a cousin of mine about three weeks ago had to go for brain surgery because he had a blood clot.
[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:27.940]   And let me tell you something, when your heart goes out for someone because they're in hospital,
[02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:32.500]   fight for their life, and you feel bad because you haven't talked to them, you haven't spoken to
[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:36.100]   them, you haven't checked up on them. I personally had those issues because I tell
[02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:40.500]   Gileo, at least I love them all the time. I tell my friends and I love them. And I take the time
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:47.380]   to have one shows or record things. And you cannot get back anything. Pictures don't just do justice.
[02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:53.140]   You can record voices and stories and all the things that that person knows that you won't think of
[02:18:53.140 --> 02:18:57.540]   till later on when you miss them. So don't wait till they're gone to say, what was that story about
[02:18:57.540 --> 02:19:05.700]   where grandma's first job was or grandpa in the war or whatever it is. A lot of lives have been lost
[02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:10.260]   over the last year. You've been stuck in the house. You should really take some time and document
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:16.260]   things for yourself and for your family and if you have children. I love all you guys are listening.
[02:19:16.260 --> 02:19:20.740]   I appreciate you guys so much. And another twit is in the can.
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:24.100]   Yeah, thank you Owen as always.
