[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.880]   The show we cover the week's Tech News.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.800]   We've got a very prestigious panel.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   A very dignified, I feel like I'm sitting amongst my betters.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.200]   Philip Elmer DeWitt is here.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.600]   First time in studio.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.800]   - That's true.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.120]   - Philip, legendary back journalist for years.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.000]   We were at Fortune and now runs PED 3.0.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.080]   Or I shouldn't say the point,
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.200]   'cause that'll add an extra dot.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.360]   3-0.com.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.680]   - Apple 3.0.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.960]   - Apple 3.0.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.120]   But it is PED 30.com.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.960]   - Correct, correct.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.280]   - And normally you live in New England, right?
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.880]   - Yeah, in the Connecticut River Valley.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.240]   - Nice, it's beautiful there.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.440]   - Different, it's farmland like here.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.920]   But we don't have hills shaped like buttocks.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.600]   - Are you implying that our hills are shaped like bogs?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.520]   - Yeah, they're almost Badunka-dunk.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.680]   (laughing)
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.760]   - We got the Badunka-dunka-pedaluma ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.920]   That's good.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.880]   See, it takes a new, a fresh eye for me.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.800]   It really appreciates my own hometown.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.440]   Well, you're out here for WWDC.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   We'll talk about that.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.280]   - That's what that's right.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280]   - Just a second, let me introduce the rest of the panel.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.200]   Phil Libin is also here,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.800]   famed as a founder and CEO of Evernote.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   And the last time you were here, you were a VC,
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.360]   but it looks like you started a new company.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.200]   - I did.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   We are launching a new company tomorrow.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.960]   It's our first day being a CEO again.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.640]   - Wow, congratulations tomorrow.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.480]   - Tomorrow.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.560]   - Today's Sunday, right?
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.400]   Yeah, tomorrow.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.120]   - You shed 80 pounds and you gained a company.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.040]   - I did.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   - I wanna ask you how you lost, you look so good.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.600]   - Thank you, you do too.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.440]   - Thank you.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.120]   You lost 80 pounds by fasting.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.960]   - Yes, it turns out when you stop eating, you lose weight.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.680]   - It's a remarkable revelation.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.840]   All turtles, we'll talk about that in a little bit
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.680]   is your new company.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.960]   It is an AI startup studio.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.000]   I don't even, I think this is a language
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.480]   I don't even understand anymore,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.600]   but we will talk about that in a bit.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.120]   But first, let me also say hello.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.760]   - All the way from Morocco, it's Mike Elgin.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.560]   You need a-- - I need a Morocco.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.520]   - You need a rooftop.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.760]   - You need a Fez, if you're gonna be in Fez.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.280]   Do they wear Fez as in Fez?
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.560]   - Are you sitting down, Lee?
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.240]   I don't wanna break this to you, but I guess I have to.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.240]   Almost nobody wears a Fez in Fez.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.680]   (laughing)
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.600]   - They mostly wear American baseball hats.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.400]   - Yeah, caps.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.440]   Yeah, a Fez is kind of our, I don't know why,
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.260]   for some strange reason, our trademark.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.560]   We all have twit Fez's.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.240]   I guess it's the last bastion in Fez's.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.080]   First, Atta Turk kicks the Fez out of Turkey,
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.440]   and now Morocco has gone baseball caps.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.480]   We're gonna keep the Fez alive here.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.920]   And this is part of your nomadic lifestyle.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.240]   I know you're gonna have a gastro nomadic experience
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.320]   here early next year, right?
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.200]   - We are, we haven't finalized the date.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   We decided to do Barcelona first,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.360]   then the Prosecco growing area of Italy,
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.160]   and probably Mexico City.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.240]   But we went to Italy to check it out,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.720]   and man, that part of the world is absolutely stunning.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.240]   But first one's in Barcelona in September.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   - Can't wait, gastro nomadic.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.520]   - I'm really excited about it.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.600]   - We should also mention that it is Ramadan,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.120]   and that is a very important month-long festival,
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.920]   of course, in your part of the world, as well as here.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.840]   And because Ramadan is being a fast thing.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.680]   - It's a festival.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.760]   - You fast all day, no water, no food.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.840]   But that means feasting and parties at night,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.280]   and because you're on the roof,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.160]   you're surrounded by parties.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.400]   Mostly it sounds like kids.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.240]   - That's...
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.560]   - Oh.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.400]   - Right.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.240]   (laughing)
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.720]   - That's right.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.440]   - I mean, people really celebrate it here.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.400]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   - We can hear the kids.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.000]   - Nobody loses any weight,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.320]   'cause they're really feast.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.000]   And it's really a lot of fun.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.880]   We've actually broken the fast at around 7.30 PM.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.240]   They're a big cannon that goes off.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.240]   You hear the call to prayer,
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.360]   and then you're just (clicking)
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.760]   big cannon, and then everybody can feast,
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   and they all sit around the family together.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.960]   So we did that with a couple of families,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.400]   and the food is delicious.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.080]   Everybody's very happy.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.480]   And then they pretty much stay up most of the night.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.240]   They eat three squares during the night,
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.040]   and they have to be finished eating 3.30 in the morning,
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.840]   and then there's no food from like 3.30 to like 7.30.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.120]   - Oh.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.200]   - That's hardly a fast.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.240]   - Well, it is a fast.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.760]   It's just a, it's not a weight loss fast.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.920]   It's just a, it's a religious fast food.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.400]   You know, it's interesting when I started reading
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.360]   about fasting, 'cause it was you, by the way,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.400]   who triggered this all fill.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.520]   And then I talked to Kevin Rose,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.880]   and he made a fasting happen on and on and on.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.360]   It seems like all my friends were doing this new thing,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.400]   which is intermittent fasting.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.080]   It's not fasting for extremely lengthy periods of time.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.280]   It's reefer fast.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.800]   How long do you fast, though?
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.840]   I shouldn't say that.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.680]   - Two to eight days?
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.520]   - Yeah.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.440]   - Like, so yeah. - Eights a lot.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.280]   I'm done.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.080]   I, I, I, I, too is plenty for me.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.160]   But that's more for health and weight loss.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.680]   Ramadan is more, it's a religious fast,
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.040]   but every, it seems every major religion actually has
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.600]   a fasting tradition of some kind.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.000]   - Yeah. It's a, - Yeah.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.480]   - Goes back a long way, and it's kind of fun.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.320]   - Yeah.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.360]   I actually have enjoyed it.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.080]   Anyway, we'll talk about that some other time,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.480]   'cause this is,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.240]   Twit, and we're supposed to talk about tech,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.000]   and it looks like tomorrow's a big day.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.720]   The Worldwide Developers Conference,
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.200]   Apple's yearly event,
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.760]   they haven't had a public event since September,
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.620]   eight months, right?
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.720]   Something like that.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.160]   - My wife calls it WWD 40.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.720]   (laughs)
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   Well, it is the squeaky developer
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.520]   that gets the grease or something.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.360]   I, I think, I have of two minds.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.240]   First of all, there have been very few leaks about
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.080]   WWDC this year.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.680]   - It's a weird, yeah.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.880]   I don't know if it's because,
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.240]   what's his name, he went to Bloomberg.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.040]   - Mark Herman's-- - Mark getting the leaks.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.440]   - Yeah, but they're not,
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.800]   there was one WWD where he just had everything.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.640]   - He knew it all.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.480]   - Yeah.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.280]   - I think, well, so that's the two minds.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.240]   One is, he does know it all,
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.000]   and there's nothing, there's new laptops,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.080]   maybe a Siri device, iOS 11, Mac OS,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.160]   we've decided it's gonna be Catalina, by the way.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.000]   - Okay.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.080]   - I just thought I'd say that.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.360]   And then, there's not much else to say.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.560]   - Or Apple could have now saw I've been in reality
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.920]   and clear phones and a new iPad.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.160]   - Yeah.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.360]   - And it's just, nobody knows.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.200]   Nobody knows.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.640]   I think, he's leaked probably the biggest things,
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.480]   probably gonna be the Siri speaker,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.680]   whatever they call it.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.840]   And I had to get excited about
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.480]   productizing Siri, which is such a laggard.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.400]   - Well, first they have to fix Siri,
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.040]   and I think that's supposedly one of the things--
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.520]   - They've been fixing Siri since they bought it.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.120]   - It's not gonna get any better.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.640]   - It's embarrassing.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.400]   Someone did a study, came out last week,
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.480]   and they rated, it was like 5,000 queries,
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.920]   and who did, did you see that you've done this already?
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.200]   And Siri led in just completely wrong answers.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.480]   I swear at Siri more than I do anything else.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.160]   In fact, it's a joke, running joke with Lisa and me,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.440]   my wife, well, for some reason has this
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   undying faith in Siri, she'll ask Siri stuff,
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.040]   and I'm just gonna know.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.600]   - Yeah, no, I gave up on that.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.240]   I have Alexa and Google Home.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.800]   I'm trying to get them to talk to each other,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.840]   but it doesn't work yet.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.800]   But you throw different kinds of questions.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.560]   - They're domains differ, but they're basically
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.440]   roughly equivalent.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.280]   Cortana is the next one down, maybe.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.480]   - I've never used that, is that good?
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.880]   - Yeah, so it's better than Siri.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.720]   - Yeah, well that's the same much.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.880]   - You're into AI, Phil.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.080]   Why is it so hard?
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.200]   What is Apple doing wrong?
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.680]   Why can't Apple create a product
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.920]   that at least competes with Alexa?
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.640]   - I mean, I think a lot of what they do
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.200]   in Siri is pretty impressive.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.920]   It's just a more diffuse use case.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.600]   Alexa has specific interactions and use cases
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.000]   that it's really good at.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It isn't really trying to be a general purpose assistant,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.440]   and I think Siri tries to be a little bit more
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.280]   general purpose.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.800]   - It's a lot easier to say, oh, I could play music for you,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.840]   I can do a kitchen timer, I have these domains
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   that I can work with.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.000]   - I miss Alexa, like when I'm traveling.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.840]   - I do too.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.680]   - I'm like, I kind of--
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.000]   - I get long miss it, yeah.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.480]   (laughing)
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.800]   - My theory about Alexa is that--
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.320]   - Let's call her, by the way, let's do this.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.360]   Everybody at home a favorite call, Echo.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.200]   - Okay, Echo.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.400]   - I started it and I apologize.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.040]   Because it really is gonna trigger people.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.480]   - What really impresses people about Echo
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.160]   is that it understands you so frequently,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.600]   and I always assume that that's because
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.440]   it has a plug in the wall.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.200]   So it can power seven microphones,
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.000]   and that's where the strength of its--
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.080]   - Well, if that's the case in an Apple series device
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   that is plugged in, it has to be able to do it.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.920]   - They should be able to do it, Mike's.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.960]   The other part of the rumor is that it will have
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.080]   better speakers.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.920]   Echo has always had kind of weak speakers.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.240]   Googles were a little bit better,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.800]   I think that was one area Google decided to excel in.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.520]   - Mike, did you bring your Google home with you to Morocco?
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.120]   - I didn't, but I always bring my Echo with me
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.040]   everywhere we travel.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.760]   - You have an Echo with you, does it work there?
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.320]   - It works great.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.320]   You can't, it won't default to where you are.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.800]   So we have to specify, I want the local weather,
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.080]   we have to specify Fes Morocco.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080]   But other than that, it works great.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.080]   It plays music, it plays our Amazon music and so on.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.400]   And that's one of the reasons why we bring
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.360]   the full size Echo because it's also like,
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.520]   we can always have music everywhere we go.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.080]   - So you don't mind those speakers,
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.280]   you consider those adequate?
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   - They're certainly adequate.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.320]   I really, it's hard to think of any sort of speaker system
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.840]   that's that compact that would be significantly better
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.680]   than that, right?
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.320]   - Yeah, compared to any Bluetooth speaker, it's okay.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.920]   - Yeah, you're waiting for the Sony's integration.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.000]   - Yeah, we were supposed to get that at six months ago.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.800]   I think there's something not working quite right yet.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.280]   I agree that will, frankly, Sonos,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.160]   if you had to pick somebody who missed the boat,
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.320]   it's Sonos, if they could have put that technology
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.080]   into those speakers, that would have been a killer problem.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.920]   - The school, I also--
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.800]   - Go ahead, go ahead, Mike.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.560]   - I'm sorry, I also think this is an opportunity
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.840]   for Apple to actually get into that Sonos space
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.760]   because really, Sonos has an Apple S kind of reputation
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.560]   for high quality and a compact size.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.200]   It's very elegant to use and so on.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.440]   And I think Apple would like to be in that space
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.360]   except for just dumb speakers
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.200]   are not interesting enough for Apple.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.800]   If they can have really high quality speakers,
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.640]   and again, I don't expect them to necessarily do this,
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.320]   but I think they should do this,
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.640]   really high quality speakers
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.520]   who could also double as extra speakers
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.600]   for the Apple TV experience.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.840]   I think that would be great.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.000]   Either way, it doesn't matter.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.560]   The Apple fans are all gonna jump on this thing no matter what.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.040]   It's going to be Siri.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.960]   It's gonna be adequate for lots and lots of people,
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.800]   no matter what.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.600]   And I believe, and I said this before in the show, Leo,
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.440]   I think this whole smart speaker thing is a stop gap.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.040]   And eventually, we're gonna be wearing this kind of thing
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.640]   somewhere on our body, probably in glasses,
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.800]   probably AirPod type of integrations.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.120]   Give it five years or six years or seven years.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.320]   I think that smart speakers
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.840]   gonna seem kind of antiquated.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.440]   - Yeah, but five years is a good product life.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.240]   I mean, that's, you know.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.440]   - Yeah, the problem is, I mean,
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.560]   I can see Apple doing the hardware,
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.440]   but I just don't think that they will ever catch up to,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.360]   frankly, it's gonna be Google that's gonna win.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.240]   Because while Echo is ahead, 'cause they launched earlier,
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.360]   Google's the one collecting all the signals.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.080]   Google does more about it.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.040]   - You don't think, well, you're an AI guy again, Phil.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.440]   You don't think that's getting them ahead, it's starting.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.960]   - I think the main lesson about AI right now
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.320]   is the most important thing are really well thought out,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.520]   specific use cases.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.160]   - Not data, not training.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.280]   - No, it's like, it's interaction.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.200]   It's like, who's got the best attention to detail
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.640]   about what are the great experiences
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.560]   that you're gonna have with this thing?
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.360]   - Is that because we're at early days,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.960]   and so general intelligence,
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.880]   general artificial intelligence is way off,
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.920]   so we have to be domain specific.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.080]   Or, 'cause ultimately, wouldn't we want something
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.920]   that was generally intelligent?
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.760]   - No, why?
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.120]   (laughs)
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.360]   - 'Cause then I don't have to know what domain
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.280]   that particular agent's good at,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.120]   I can just address a question to it.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.360]   - And is that why we wanted, is that why Siri fails?
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.200]   - I don't think so, I think where AI as an industry
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.840]   went wrong is right in the beginning,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.760]   right with the Turing test.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   Like the Turing test was a...
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.800]   - Most AI experts agree that that was a dumb test.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.200]   - It's just like a bad idea to try to make something
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.240]   that's generally intelligent,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.960]   especially if the bar you're setting
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.560]   is like human level intelligence is somehow like the goal.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.400]   - And then it's, yeah.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.240]   - Does it make any sense?
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.080]   - That's challenging.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.880]   - And there's so much you could do,
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.120]   so much useful you can do before that.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.000]   - Everything that I work on
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.280]   starts out being better than human.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.640]   - In a domain.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.800]   - Exactly.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.840]   And I don't care about what a person could do,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.360]   there's plenty of people in the planet
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.040]   that I don't really feel like interacting with,
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.400]   I don't need more of those.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.800]   (laughs)
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.880]   I want experiences.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.840]   - I want experiences that are better
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.760]   than what a person can do.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.840]   - This is AI focus on that.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.480]   - All right, I get it now.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.840]   - So Alexa is much better than a person could be,
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.920]   I'm sorry, Echo is much better than a person could be,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.480]   at the stuff that Echo is good for.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.320]   And Siri, I think--
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.640]   - It's different than the Echo's.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.480]   - Say again?
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.320]   - Sorry to interrupt all.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.800]   Amazon is way ahead of the game precisely,
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.960]   because of what Phil is saying,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.200]   they have the Echo look, the Echo show,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.560]   they have the different types of Echo's,
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.280]   and that's, I think, brilliant,
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.560]   to have a different special purpose Echo
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.760]   for every room in the house.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.040]   Can't wait for the bathroom Echo.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.840]   - Don't think about it as like,
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.080]   I don't even think about a special purpose,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.920]   I just think about it as like a sharply good experience.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.600]   That's the products that win.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.560]   Once the technology gets to a point
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.600]   where it goes from being an engineering problem
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.920]   to being a product problem,
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.760]   like the products that win are the ones that are the best
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.320]   designed with specific interactions
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.080]   and delightful experiences in mind.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.440]   - I have a different take on how Apple fits into this.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.320]   I think Google Homes problem is that it doesn't have,
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.060]   it doesn't have a way to monetize it well.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.920]   Echo has a way to monetize it
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.640]   because people buy more stuff through Amazon
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.120]   because they're using the Echo.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.080]   Apple has the perfect monetization strategy,
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.440]   they sell the device in large quantities.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.280]   - But to do that, there has to be a high margin device.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.920]   It has to be, I mean, an Echo,
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.000]   you can get a dot for $40 now,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.840]   you get all of the entire Echo experience minus the speaker
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.120]   for $40 because Amazon makes it up on the other end.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.320]   But what would Apple have to charge to make this
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.760]   a valuable product?
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.360]   - Hundreds, hundreds.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.200]   - It doesn't matter.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.040]   - It doesn't matter.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.880]   - It doesn't matter because it's Apple.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.720]   - And they're gonna buy it.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.560]   - Like Mike.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.640]   - One of the things I'm intrigued about
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.480]   is whether Apple can go international fast.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.520]   Right now, the Echo is dominant,
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.640]   but only in the United States.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.760]   If Apple can do a smart speaker system and go global,
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.400]   they'll suddenly be ahead of everyone.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.800]   - Right, and they already have a lot of language stuff
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.640]   under their belt.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.240]   - I think a lot of this comes down to like,
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   where is the center of gravity?
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.040]   Where's like the center of empathy for each company?
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.640]   And you can tell a lot, I think,
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.160]   about what's gonna happen just based on that.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.560]   - Do you mean empathy or brand reputation?
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.480]   - I mean, like, what fundamentally
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.320]   is the most important thing to each company?
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.360]   Like for Amazon, like the empathy is really on
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.600]   selling you stuff, right?
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.880]   Whether it's physical products or subscriptions,
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.000]   Amazon Prime or video, like they want you to,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.680]   they want you to buy stuff that you love
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.400]   and need and have a good experience with it.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.640]   For Google, their fundamental thing that they're about
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.200]   is showing you ads and like getting you to click on stuff.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.640]   Same as for Facebook.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.600]   For Apple, their fundamental thing is selling you
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.080]   Apple devices.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.800]   None of these companies has transcended
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   past that original purchase.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.880]   - Increasingly, Apple's services company too.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.720]   A lot of their revenue is coming for services.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.560]   They see that as their biggest growth area.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.760]   - Yeah, but what's the stuff that they're excellent at?
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.880]   Like the Amazon is world-class at selling you stuff.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.600]   Apple is right now really world-class
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.200]   at making the devices.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.280]   - They both, I think Amazon and Apple both share
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.360]   an interest in making it really a good experience
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.280]   for the customer.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.760]   And for Amazon, it's a good experience for the shopper.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.720]   And for Apple is a good experience for the user.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.880]   Google, not so, my experience is not so much.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.680]   Try to find a human to help you with a Google problem.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   - I think the Amazon center of gravity
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   is closer to what will make a good assistant
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.560]   a good AI than Google's or Facebook's.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.320]   I think if the company is basically about
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.120]   getting your attention, distracting you,
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.360]   making it click on an ad,
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.080]   that isn't a quality that you'd want than a friend.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.760]   - It's pretty hard to make you listen to ads on a Google home.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.520]   - But it's just like you wouldn't accept a person
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.360]   acting that way.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.640]   - No, no, of course not.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.200]   So I think that that's gonna give them a harder time
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.600]   in actually getting to the most amazing AI products.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.440]   Where's--
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.280]   - I agree with that. - I think Apple
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.760]   and Amazon are better aligned.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.800]   - I agree with what you're saying, Phil,
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.880]   but I would amend that to say that Apple's genius
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.400]   is not just selling you the hardware,
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.680]   but it's getting money on all the levels.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.320]   They sell you the hardware, they sell you the software,
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.520]   they get a third of what other people sell you.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.840]   And it's all of it.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.280]   It's the services, it's everything.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.120]   - I agree. - The subscriptions,
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:10.960]   you name it.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.800]   And I think that's a really interesting model
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.840]   for Apple on this kind of device.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.200]   I mean, if you think about the money
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.920]   that they could make on an app store for the smart speaker,
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.400]   it could be enormous.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.200]   I mean, I have trouble really picturing it
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.720]   and nobody's done it well.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.040]   Amazon certainly has not done the third party,
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.480]   app thing very well.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.200]   You have to memorize all this stuff.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.320]   It's very difficult.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.440]   If somebody like Apple can crack that,
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.920]   if Siri can actually choose the third party app,
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.840]   offer it, you can buy it with a command or whatever,
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.720]   then they could be way ahead of the game
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.320]   and they could be looking at a revenue stream
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.800]   that's comparable in some ways to the iPhone app store
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.440]   where it's just very lucrative
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.560]   and they dominate the field for those third party apps.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.120]   - And I think Apple had a problem with people asking
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.120]   for music and getting it from either Amazon or Google.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.840]   Apple really needs them together from Apple.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.000]   So this is an opportunity that they can't.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.360]   - It will probably, it sounds like then it'll probably be
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.760]   a fairly expensive $400, $500 music device
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.720]   with very good speakers, right?
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.400]   - Yeah, well, you know, it sounded good
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.840]   when they said it had surround sound
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.440]   and then I looked more closely and said virtual.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.680]   - Remember they had a speaker once?
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.480]   - Yeah, they did and I remember Steve Jobs saying
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.320]   he threw out his stereo because he liked the iPod high-fist.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.680]   - Yeah, they had that thing.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.800]   I bought one. - I bought one.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.640]   - Yeah, I bought one
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.800]   and then they never spoke about it again.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.240]   - Right, yeah.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.720]   So it's kind of, it sounds like the most important thing
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.640]   Apple could announce tomorrow frankly,
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.400]   will be a Siri device.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.440]   - I think it's certainly the newest thing.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.440]   - Hardware gets the attention with Apple.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.360]   - I think-- - Although tomorrow
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.640]   is not a hardware event.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.120]   - As a developer event, but Apple has so few events
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.160]   and so few times that they can talk to the press
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.880]   and the public that I think they treat WWDC
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.480]   as a keynote in the truest sense of the word.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.440]   - You don't usually get insights into the new hardware
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.640]   though at WWDC.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.080]   - They have from time to time.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.480]   They've been asked Max for-- - For sure.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.120]   - Is there Max Pro, who's the headline or then?
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.120]   - And there's usually developer focused stuff.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.960]   - Yeah.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.320]   - So I don't know and even if they announced the laptops,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.560]   I don't think that that would be a big thing.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.840]   The reason I think the Siri announced it makes a lot of sense
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.480]   is you're talking to developers.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.320]   You're talking about basically a new ecosystem
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.040]   and almost a new platform. - Almost a new platform.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.880]   - Yep, yep.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.720]   - So developers are very-- - I mean,
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.240]   if you think about the perfect home run
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.880]   that they could do tomorrow would be to announce this product,
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.320]   have it be super high quality,
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   have there be one or two attributes about it
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.200]   that are surprising and then say,
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.360]   here's the SDK everyone, go for it.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.680]   - It's hard. - It's kind of hard to imagine
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.080]   that they'd be that far along with it
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.640]   but that would be amazing if they did that.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.480]   - It's hard for me to believe that it's really gonna be
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.320]   like a high end or even a medium end speaker system.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.720]   I know that's what everyone's saying
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.400]   and I guess it's likely to be true.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.280]   To me it just seems like Apple announces stuff
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.760]   that can grow fairly quickly.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.000]   And for their target audience,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.960]   like most people who are Apple fans
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.800]   have high quality speakers of whatever type.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.080]   - Oh, so you think it'll be a thing you plug in?
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.360]   Like an Apple TV, a thing you plug into.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.720]   - I just don't think they're gonna do something
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   that's gonna take years to roll out.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.320]   Like I'm a huge Apple fanboy.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.680]   I've bought just about everything that Apple's ever released.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.840]   I'm not gonna go buy a new speaker.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.680]   - Take Siri as it stands in the phone
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.800]   and put it in a standalone device.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.640]   - Maybe?
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.040]   - By the way, home automation is also, I think,
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.280]   they've only kept expecting with HomeKit
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.360]   that they deliver a hub,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.040]   they've yet to deliver up the Apple TV wasn't it?
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.720]   - What I would love is for something like Siri
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.040]   would just be the hardware is just super high quality
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.880]   microphones.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   - Yep.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.520]   - And it just integrates well with whatever speakers
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.400]   you've got, so I'm like that would be the thing
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.240]   that I would buy.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.080]   - Buy a Bluetooth?
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   - I don't know, something, magic.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.480]   But I'm not gonna, there's no way that I'm buying
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.040]   entirely new speakers tomorrow.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.880]   - Right.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.720]   - That's a very good point.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.600]   - So would Apple release something that didn't have
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.120]   the potential to sell millions of units right away?
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.480]   - The only reason I went to this way is because we agreed
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.840]   that large margin was critical as a hardware company, right?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.280]   - Yes, but large margins are in China for Apple now.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.240]   So does everybody in China have a super ultra high quality
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.000]   speaker system?
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.760]   I don't think that that's true.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.200]   And the other thing is that we also know about Apple
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.320]   that they love to control the entire experience.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.560]   I doubt that Apple's gonna wanna just say,
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.960]   well whatever speakers you have around,
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.640]   that's gonna be your experience with this.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.920]   And I can't imagine Apple coming out with a sound experience,
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.720]   a music experience that's inferior to the Echo.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.400]   It's gotta be better than the Echo.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.240]   - Not much better.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.280]   - It would be much better than the Echo
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.200]   if it worked well with your existing speakers.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.800]   - All it would have to do is be stereo.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.600]   - I agree with Mike though.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.920]   I think the speaker is there, it's an Echo.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.240]   The standalone thing has to be sound better than the other two.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.400]   The other three is,
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.280]   - And home actually sounded,
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.960]   well there is no, Microsoft's been rumored to,
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.160]   but has not announced a standalone quartile device.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.240]   - Well, or not at all, right?
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.680]   Or it doesn't have to sound like anything,
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.360]   which in which case it won't be compared to it.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.200]   - Right.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.560]   I think that's, but that's a little bit more
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.680]   of a commoditized product.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.840]   - That's like the Echo.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.480]   Where it is,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.920]   I mean, I can see the Apple TV doesn't include a television set.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.120]   It's just a box that connects your,
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:10.960]   - Yeah.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.320]   I mean, high quality speakers are heavy.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   They're bad for logistics.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.240]   There's like all sorts of things that make this seem to me
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   like a not Apple product.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.960]   - Do you see maybe two products, one with speakers,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.800]   one with that?
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.440]   - But I mean, Apple already sells third party speakers
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.120]   in their Apple store and always has.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.000]   You go in there and there's a big clear speakers
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.840]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.280]   They're already selling speakers, right?
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.480]   It seems like they want to sell them.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.960]   - These in Beats fundamentally, a speaker manufacturer.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.400]   I know they're little speakers, but they're speakers.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.640]   Couldn't we have Beats speakers?
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.200]   That's a, by the way, that's a brand
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.360]   that would probably do very well.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.360]   Is a Beats desktop or high-fives speaker?
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.880]   - To me that speakers feels like a low margin business
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.200]   and not the kind of thing that we would do.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.800]   - The headphones are very high margin business.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.480]   It's a huge high margin business.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.760]   Well, your part's speaking to you.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.320]   - But how cool is this?
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.680]   None of us has any idea.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.440]   This is a shot on. - This is unprecedented.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.280]   - It's unprecedented.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.280]   - Yeah.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.120]   - Yeah.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   - Mark Gurman, where are you on this?
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.960]   - You just made WWDC about 100 times more exciting
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.280]   'cause I was really gearing up for a fairly dull show,
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.560]   but this will be something to watch.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.040]   What does Apple do with Siri?
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.280]   And when will it be available?
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.120]   This month?
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.760]   - No. - This fall?
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.600]   Probably this fall.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.720]   - Yeah, probably. - This decade.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.560]   - This decade.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.880]   (laughing)
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.960]   All right, well, WWDC's tomorrow, our coverage
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.640]   begins 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.000]   That is 1,700 UTC.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.080]   We'll be streaming live.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.640]   Nathan Olver's Giles and Meghan Moroni.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.760]   We'll be covering it.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.480]   And as we always do, Apple has said,
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.000]   they're gonna stream the keynote.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.080]   We will do our kind of mystery science 3000 version of it.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.920]   Well, we'll snark away while Tim Cook takes the stage.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.040]   You know, who will not take the stage,
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.520]   and I'm sad to say is Bizoma.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.520]   - Yeah. - Bozoma.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.440]   - Bozoma. - Bozoma. - Bozoma.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.560]   - Bozoma. - Bozoma.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.400]   - The woman who was so good last year,
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.280]   WWDC, it was a fairly dull presentation.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.240]   And she comes on, she's got a great marketing experience.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.520]   She was working with Apple Music,
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.520]   and just lit the place up.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.400]   - Too much charisma.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.800]   She can go have her own career.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.880]   She doesn't need Apple.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.400]   - They always said she was her own brand.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.880]   - Right, and of course, the first thing we did
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.960]   was, "Bizoma, St. John."
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.120]   The first thing we did is, "Who is this?
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.880]   "Where have they been hiding her?"
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.800]   But apparently, she's tweeted or something
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.000]   that she's on her way elsewhere.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.080]   Axios says this.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:33.080]   "She was head of global consumer marketing for Apple Music."
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.520]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.360]   Come back with more.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.360]   Great panel.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.480]   "Esteemed."
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.080]   Panel, Mike Elgin.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   Celebrating Ramadan in Fes, Morocco, in the rooftops.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.920]   - I'm only doing the eating in the feasting part,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.720]   not the fasting part, just the feasting.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.400]   - Well, I understand there's some really amazing
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.640]   sweets involved in breaking your fast Ramadan.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.280]   - Yes, yes, absolutely.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.800]   All the Ramadan food is absolutely delicious.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.000]   - You're making me very jealous.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.480]   - Phil Libin is also here, formerly a founder
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.840]   and the CEO at Evernote.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.960]   He's now, and a VC, he's now at all Turtles,
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.280]   a company, an AI company launching tomorrow.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.680]   All-Tirtles.com, it's turtles all the way down.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.880]   I got that reference right over there.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.560]   - You did, you were one of the few people.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.520]   - No, really, Geeks know that.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.600]   Can we hear a little bit more about the name?
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.800]   Why do you call it?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.440]   Should we do that after the break?
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.280]   - Let's do it after the break.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.680]   We'll do a tease, which is so silly on a podcast,
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.000]   'cause it just makes people fast forward
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:35.840]   with the commercial.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.920]   (laughing)
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.520]   I can't break old habits, my old radio habits.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.320]   Coming up in just a moment, what does all turtles mean?
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.720]   And what is an AI startup studio?
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.600]   It feels great to see you.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.440]   - Good to see you.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.640]   - I do at some point want to talk a little bit about fasting.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.160]   You've lost, you look so good, you've lost a lot of weight.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.440]   - Thank you. - You're feeling good.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.360]   - I am. - And you inspired me to do it.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   - Didn't mean to.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.120]   - We should show before and after pictures.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:27:59.960]   - We should do it.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   - Look at it, it feels--
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.320]   - Still a Google image search for it.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.240]   - We've actually watched it, 'cause you've been on the show
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.960]   since before you started doing this.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.800]   - Yeah.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.240]   - And even since the last time you were on,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.240]   you've lost quite a bit.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.440]   - And my beard fell off.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.480]   - I know, it's amazing.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.640]   - Are you gonna stop fasting?
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.480]   - Soon or later.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.320]   - Yeah.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.560]   - I think you have to at some point.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.560]   - Yeah, you have to eat once in a while, but no, I actually,
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.680]   I hope to keep doing it for a long time.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.520]   - It feels pretty good.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.880]   - It does, the scary thing.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.720]   - Yeah.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.560]   - You're not worried you're gonna get
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.960]   into some sort of eating disorder.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.640]   - No, I'm not.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.720]   - I mean, like I don't wanna eat anymore.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.560]   In fact, after I fast, I usually fast
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.320]   for no more than 36 to 42 hours,
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.400]   but after I fast and I eat, I feel terrible.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.960]   'Cause my body's now digesting this food.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.800]   - That goes away.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.600]   After a few weeks, I just feel pretty good all the time.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.440]   - All the time.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.560]   - He feels good all the time.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.360]   That's what turtles all the way down means.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.200]   - That's great.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.120]   - Meanwhile, you and I have Philip Elmer
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.760]   to admit, PED is here, PED 30 is his tech blog
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.720]   where he writes all about Apple 3.0.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.760]   - Apple? All the time.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.040]   - All the time, all Apple.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.040]   He's here for WWDC.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.600]   - Our show today, I got it at W, I'm sorry.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.440]   There's only two, www.dc.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.640]   - That'd be a good domain name.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.720]   - He just did it again.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.240]   - Yeah, WWDC.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.000]   WWDC. - WWDC 40.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.920]   WWDC 40.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.760]   Our show today brought to you by stamps.com.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.080]   If you do mailing in your business,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.320]   and actually doesn't everybody,
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.280]   at least mail bills or brochures,
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.480]   maybe you're an Etsy seller, an eBay seller,
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.160]   you sell on Amazon and you gotta do fulfillment,
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.560]   you should not be going to the post office, my friend.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.360]   You should not be going to the post office to buy postage.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.560]   You should not be bringing packages to the post office.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.680]   I've got a better way, stamps.com.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.120]   With stamps.com, you can buy and print real US postage
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.840]   from your computer and your printer.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.360]   You don't need a postage meter, that's so 1980s.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.080]   You don't need anything, you just need what you've got.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.840]   And stamps.com.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.520]   Although, I have to say, we've got a special offer
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.000]   that will send you free a USB scale
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.880]   that will really be a nice addition to your stamps.com.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.360]   You just plop the thing you're gonna mail on the scale.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.240]   Stamps.com will print out the proper postage,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.160]   they'll even print out a mailing label
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.960]   or print right on envelopes with your company's logo,
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.360]   your return address, bar coding,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.400]   this post office loves stamps.com.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.440]   It speeds their automation.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.840]   They're thrilled to have you use stamps.com.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.720]   So much so that you can't just pop a package above,
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.640]   I think it's above a pound,
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.360]   you can't just put it in the mailbox.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.680]   They want you to bring it to the post office
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   so they can look you in the eye and look at the package.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.360]   Except if you're using stamps.com, no, that's no problem.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.040]   They'll come and get it because they know stamps.com
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.600]   and they know you, it's an amazing service.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.120]   Create your stamps account in minutes,
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.640]   no equipment, no long term commitments.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.080]   They'll, now if you go to stamps.com, do me a favor,
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.520]   click the microphone in the upper right hand corner
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.080]   and type in our offer code TWIT
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.080]   because that's when you get the really good deal.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.680]   You get a $110 bonus offer.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.040]   That includes that USB scale.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.040]   It includes $55 in postage, free postage,
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.560]   that you can use over the first few months of your account.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:12.280]   You can't use it all at once, but that's still $55.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.000]   Of course, you get a month's trial of stamps.com.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.920]   It's a great deal and no risk trial offer.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.120]   Unlike the post office stamps.com never closes.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.360]   It's always available, it's right there at your desk.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.960]   You never have to get up and you just press a button
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.400]   and the mail carrier comes to you to pick up your postage.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.440]   Go to stamps.com, click the microphone at the top
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.080]   and enter the offer code TWIT to try it today.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.920]   stamps.com.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.960]   You commit to a certain amount of time for each ad?
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.200]   No.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:50.520]   I think what we do is we say, well, you're buying a minute ad,
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.880]   but Leo doesn't know how to do a minute ad, so you're OK.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.200]   Something like that.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.640]   I don't think I've ever done an ad.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.480]   On the radio, I have to.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.080]   You know what it is?
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.800]   It's after years of being tightly constrained
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.280]   to the second on radio and TV.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.960]   Now I just let it all hang out.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.040]   I don't even wear makeup.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.360]   I just-- it's freedom for me.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   So the radio you didn't have to wear makeup?
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.680]   No, but I like to.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.960]   That's the difference between wanting to and having to.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.400]   I think when I think of turtles all the way down
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.160]   of those great novels by--
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:30.880]   Discworld?
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.840]   Discworld.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.320]   Terry Pratchett.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.560]   And he talks at one point about a creation story.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.080]   But I think it also goes back to the actual creation story
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.800]   of the world being held on the back of a giant tortoise, right?
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.120]   You do, or Buddhist, or--
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.280]   So I first heard it.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.280]   It's the name that I've been thinking about for years,
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.040]   and always wanted to call something all turtles.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.320]   And mostly because it's an unusual name,
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   kind of sticks in your brain.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:32:59.920]   I love turtles.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.400]   I'm going to the Galapagos, which is turtles.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.400]   Lots of turtles.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.120]   But I--
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   There's the giant turtle holding the disc world.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:08.640]   Oh.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.400]   Sometimes the world is on the back of an elephant,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.800]   which is then standing on a turtle,
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.520]   and then that's turtles all the way down.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.080]   Sometimes it's an elephant.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.840]   That's what Terry Pratchett describes it.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.920]   Yeah, I first heard it as a Carl Sagan story,
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.120]   but that's I'm sure apocryphal, sometimes Bertrand Russell.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.240]   I think it's the Bertrand Russell story.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.840]   In fact, Stephen Hawking mentions it in brief history of time.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.080]   Yeah, that's probably where I read it.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.040]   So Bertrand Russell was giving a lecture.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.880]   He described how the Earth orbits the sun, the sun orbits,
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.720]   you know, the stars called our galaxy.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.960]   At the end of the lecture, I'm quoting Stephen Hawking,
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.280]   a little old lady-- we don't say that anymore, Stephen--
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.400]   at the back of the room got up and said,
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.920]   "Sir, what you've told us is rubbish.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.280]   The world is really a flat plate supported
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.960]   on the back of a giant tortoise."
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.840]   The scientists gave a superior smile before replying,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.160]   "Well, what's the tortoise standing on?"
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.800]   You're very clever, young man, very clever,
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.840]   but it's turtles all the way down.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.840]   Oh, I get it.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.720]   So there you go.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.720]   That's it.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.040]   That's the idea is--
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.920]   And how does that have to do with AI?
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.200]   What does that have to do with AI?
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.080]   Well, it's a platform of platforms.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.320]   The idea is whatever you're building,
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.320]   you're standing in the shoulders of the people who came
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.920]   before you, you're helping the people that come after you.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.840]   Nice.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.560]   So you're one of the turtles.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.560]   We're all turtles.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.080]   That's right.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.600]   Also, since elephants stand on turtles,
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.560]   it's a good sequel for me.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.240]   Yes, because Evernote was an elephant.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.000]   Ah, I get it now.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.160]   And your next startup's going to be what?
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:41.960]   The sea lions.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.600]   It's all going to be turtles.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:42.920]   That's it.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.720]   It's a cormorant.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.200]   Turtles will go way down.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.840]   And you already have-- it looks like you already
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.360]   have some--
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.280]   We have 11 products that we're starting with.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.160]   Is it an incubator?
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:55.600]   Not really.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.440]   It's more of a studio.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.280]   The basic idea is we're challenging the idea
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.240]   that if you're a brilliant product person, that what you
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.080]   have to do is make a company first.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.320]   Before you make a product, we're product first.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   Oh, what?
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.600]   Look, if you're a brilliant writer,
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.240]   you just write.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.760]   You don't have to make a writing company.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.320]   No.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.920]   And if you're a musician, you just play.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.680]   You don't have to make a music company.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.480]   So why is it that if you have a vision for a product
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.800]   that you have to make a startup first?
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.300]   Why?
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.200]   When you just make a product first.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.640]   And so yeah, it's a worldwide studio.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.760]   It kind of is like an incubator.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.240]   Well, except we're not focusing on a company.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.920]   We'll go cross this ideal lab a little bit, maybe.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.120]   It's like a lot of things.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.440]   To me, I'm most inspired by maybe Netflix and Amazon.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.720]   I'm trying to make Netflix.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.240]   Not a bad thing to make.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.080]   Netflix--
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:38.800]   I'll take that.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.000]   Netflix for AI products.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.760]   So just the same way that Netflix attracts the most talented
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.480]   people in film and television, and they make amazing stuff,
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.920]   and they distribute it, and they go full circle.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.400]   We just do that worldwide for products.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.880]   Among other companies, Louis Lemur's leaders
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.520]   is a part of--
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.320]   That's right.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.040]   An AI platform for finding speakers.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.480]   I didn't know that leaders was AI.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.120]   That's interesting.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.240]   All of these are, I'd say, practical AI, which is--
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.280]   it means that we really focus not on the cutting edge tech
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.680]   stack, but on the design aspect of it, like on the use cases.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.800]   We kind of did this with Evernote, right?
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.560]   So Evernote-- we started Evernote at--
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.640]   we got lucky at just the right time.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.280]   Right as mobile apps went from being an engineering-driven
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.760]   problem to a product-driven problem.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.400]   So if you were building mobile apps in 2005,
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.160]   it didn't really matter how good your design was,
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.640]   because it was all technology-constrained.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.880]   But if you were building mobile apps in 2008,
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.960]   the ones that took it as a product challenge,
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.040]   as a design challenge, not just an engineering challenge.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.240]   So we're kind of at that stage.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.000]   AI is exactly at that stage.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.880]   So if you were building something three years ago,
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.480]   it was very much engineering-driven.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.480]   You needed the lab code wearing PhDs at Google.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   Now, as long as you're not trying to do general AI,
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.920]   as long as you're trying to do a specific, beautiful use case,
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.960]   it's gone from being engineering-heavy to being product-heavy.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.360]   And that's the time for us to step in and do something.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.040]   Google's TensorFlow changed that a little bit.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.160]   I mean, it's an open source AI platform.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.520]   You can use their TPUs now.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.400]   They're doing hardware.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.520]   They've announced a Google I/O.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.000]   Yep.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.680]   Absolutely.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.160]   I mean, TensorFlow is a great example.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.760]   It commoditized the software and hardware.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.840]   Commodity-- it commoditized isn't the right word,
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.960]   but it's definitely a platform.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.400]   So--
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.040]   Easy to get.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.400]   All turtles is a meta-platform.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.600]   It's basically saying that what you couldn't do before,
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.680]   now you could do because there's a platform for it.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.720]   So now you can get closer and closer to just building
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.480]   the product first.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.760]   And that's going to keep happening.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.480]   What language do people work in?
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.520]   English, if they're in the US, Japanese and Tokyo.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.120]   Really?
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.360]   We're agnostic about the tech stack.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   So there's all sorts of-- there's some of everything.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.120]   There's a lot of TensorFlow.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.600]   But there's also just a lot of Java.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.440]   There's a lot of Python.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.200]   It's everything.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.280]   There's a lot of R.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.720]   Which I like to say, like a pirate.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   It's better.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   Or statistics.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   Statistics.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   Space.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   Language.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:57.880]   The idea is, if you're a brilliant product person,
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.000]   you have a vision.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.160]   You see a hole in the world in the shape of your product idea
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.040]   rather than having to make a startup and figure out
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.800]   how to do all of the hard but not interesting company stuff,
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.640]   which I had to do for 20 years.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.960]   You just make the product first.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.200]   And then we figure out everything else.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.080]   In other words, you just like me.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.600]   You're just trying to avoid the things
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.560]   you didn't like about your last job.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.120]   Or the last 20, yeah.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.120]   And maybe it's an incubator, but really,
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.200]   like every other incubator focuses, like, what do they incubate?
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   Right.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.200]   They fetishize companies.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.680]   They want to incubate little companies.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.040]   And what we're saying is, like, the companies are relevant.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.800]   We just want the world to have amazing products.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.360]   I think that's a very interesting concept.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:36.920]   Me too.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.240]   It starts tomorrow.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.000]   Well, we move into the office tomorrow.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.920]   Oh, how fun.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.280]   We're in Soma, 9th and Harrison.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.760]   We have our San Francisco location.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.720]   And then we're opening up Paris and Tokyo by the end of the year.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.120]   So you're one of those guys that just can't sit on the beach.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   You've got to go out and start--
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:51.960]   They've got sunburned, really.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.400]   You've got to start another company.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.000]   You just can't just take it easy.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.320]   I don't really see--
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.080]   yes.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.920]   I was talking to a friend of mine, David,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.760]   a friend who's the guy who started carbonite before that.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.520]   He did synthesize.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.720]   I mean, this guy started 100 companies.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.080]   And he's only my fourth.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.360]   Yeah, he's older.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.600]   He's older than me.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.400]   He's probably almost 70.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.680]   And he retired from carbonite.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.000]   And he started another company.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.320]   He said, I just can't stop.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.120]   He'd be working.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.960]   It must be fun, I guess.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.840]   It's fun, but I'm not optimizing for fun.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.200]   I really want to do something that has some impact.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   That has some impact.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.680]   And I think this could.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.000]   And I've got an amazing team, so I'm thrilled.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.880]   I'm optimized for fun.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.000]   Me too.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.480]   That's why we're here.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.920]   And he still is there someday.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.120]   Actually, feel you're surrounded by people optimized for fun.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.240]   Because I suspect Mike Elegant is also optimized for fun.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.440]   He's optimized for travel.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.400]   If Mike was optimized for fun, he would be wearing a Fez.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.520]   Whether or not it's common.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.720]   I know it owns one.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.080]   So big thread.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   This was kind of interesting on Reddit.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.880]   They got a lot of attention from Apple folks.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.800]   We'll do one more Apple story.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.600]   This is Foxconn Insider, which implies, perhaps, somebody
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.280]   who's deeply intimately connected with the supply chain
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.720]   in China.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.560]   Everything reported today.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:16.560]   And it is kind of a collection of all the Apple rumors.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.440]   And I'm not going to go through all of them.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.120]   But I just--
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.160]   Who had this?
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.080]   This was a big thread on Reddit.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.240]   Got a lot of attention.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.680]   And somebody on this page has collated all of the different
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.360]   things that Foxconn--
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.840]   Oh, I should have done that.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.520]   Yeah, well, you still can.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.520]   I'm just lifting.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.440]   Yeah, just cutting pastes an awesome tool.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.280]   Or put it in Evernote.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.520]   And then that way you've sanitized it.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.720]   Those links are live.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.400]   All those links?
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.680]   Oh, cool.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:47.160]   So they talked about the next generation iPhone.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.440]   And a lot of these rumors were heard
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.760]   that it's going to be harder to make than Apple anticipated,
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.880]   which might mean it's a product that doesn't come out this year,
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.160]   but early next year.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.520]   They want to put the fingerprint sensor under the glass.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.320]   That's not going to be tomorrow.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.440]   That's going to be in the iPhone event.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.920]   This is everything.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.600]   Everything.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.680]   All the rumors.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.280]   You don't believe the transparent iPhone?
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.240]   I have a bet with Robert Scoble.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.840]   He says there'll be a transparent iPhone.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.800]   Yeah, he's been saying that a lot.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.720]   I'll buy you dinner in Paris.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   In Paris.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.720]   A key surprise.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.160]   A key surprise.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   If they're actually-- no, I think I said Joelle,
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.080]   always sure.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.800]   If there is a clear one.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.120]   So he's expecting dinner in Paris.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.960]   I'm expecting--
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.400]   What is he going to get you?
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.560]   I have to learn how to bet because--
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.960]   Because it's a bad thing.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.400]   I never asked for something in return.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.640]   Am I an idiot?
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.360]   Well, you just have the pleasure of proving to me.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.800]   No, you're just supremely confident.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.840]   I do this with my wife.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.840]   Yeah, I just feel like I'm going to win.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.360]   You're just confident.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.800]   I always forget to ask for something in return.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.520]   Yeah, don't do that.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.560]   What is this project mirror shades?
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:58.480]   Apple glasses with microphones, a light sensor,
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.840]   an accelerometer.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.520]   This guy.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.240]   Why would Fox not know about that?
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.080]   And a fake nose and mustache.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.240]   That's what I'm hearing.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.120]   He's losing my confidence here.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.840]   Delayed until at least 2018 or 2019.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.600]   So we used to play WWDC bingo.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.840]   This is a good year for it.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.040]   Do that a lot.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.560]   Siri speaker, that should be right in the center.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.440]   What I'm hearing from people who
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.440]   also don't know anything.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.720]   OK.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   We're getting ISO-nose.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   I guess we were talking about--
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   Yeah, we call it ISO-nose.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.200]   That's a good one.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.720]   We're getting a new Siri.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.320]   We might be getting a new Apple watch.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.040]   That's been a while.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:35.680]   Oh, yawn.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.840]   New hardware?
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.080]   Can anybody get excited about a new Apple watch?
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.000]   This is a product that doesn't need a new anything.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.320]   What would you do different?
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.840]   I would wear it.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.280]   No.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:47.800]   I used to.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.800]   I used to, but I gave up on it.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.560]   So you need a useful Apple watch.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.200]   In a spec bump for MacBooks.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.360]   So that's kind of what I'm hoping.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.920]   Of course, the recording--
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.920]   That last recording is pretty sure.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.160]   According to FastCon Insider, might
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.760]   know about a Siri speaker, because that would be in production,
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.440]   right?
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.840]   Last design scene was similar to the trashcan Mac Pro,
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.560]   but smaller.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.400]   Yeah, that's--
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.200]   That would be pretty.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.480]   Three prototypes tested.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.840]   One with display, one without a camera, not shipping
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.720]   the Leana 2017.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.080]   We'll use a modified A9 system on a chip.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:16.800]   That would make sense.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.080]   It would be basically an iOS device.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.120]   Well, Australian guy had the same stuff.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.040]   It's got a grid like your microphone.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:26.600]   Like this?
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.480]   Not like this.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.120]   Well, that's-- yeah, you've got to have holes for the sound
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.480]   to go in.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.560]   Will we see a new iMac?
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.240]   We're kind of due for an iMac update.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:34.800]   I don't know.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.440]   I think he could slipstream better chips in there.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.240]   I haven't heard that.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.880]   We do remember that Phil Schiller, when he had his apology
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.440]   meeting for the five, saying we screwed up on the Mac Pro,
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.440]   did say, but don't worry, Pro's, there's
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.600]   going to be a new iMac this year that will make Pro's happy.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.840]   I-- that's a stretch, because what Pro's, I think,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.760]   probably mostly care about is not form factor,
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.800]   but the ability to swap in more hard drives,
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.640]   swap in newer cars, something like the old cheese grader Mac.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.720]   If they don't do that, or something that is as
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.320]   upgradable as that, they've missed the boat.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.240]   And the cheese grader Mac, that's what we call it.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.400]   I've not heard that, but I knew exactly what
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.400]   you were talking about.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:16.960]   Those were the days.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.240]   Now I'm thinking of cheese.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.760]   And I think there's a very good chance
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.320]   that they will--
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.760]   There's five years of government cheese unused.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.120]   You're a surplus.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.720]   I grew up on government cheese.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.040]   Did you--
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:26.720]   I remember that.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.720]   So much government cheese.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.200]   I remember the corner districts, and they were giving away--
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.920]   I go ahead, and when I was a kid, and our refrigerator--
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.800]   Was it a good cheese?
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.640]   It's good.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.080]   I thought it was good cheese.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.040]   We always had a giant brick of government cheese.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.080]   When I was growing up, it was--
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.560]   Apparently, they're still stock pie.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.160]   Is that like American cheese?
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.000]   It's American cheese that the government would give you.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Cheddar.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.520]   Well, it's cheddar.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.400]   Well, I guess there's excess dairy.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:49.880]   Oh, it is.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.120]   It's processed cheese.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.000]   Yeah, I don't think it was anything particularly good.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.920]   But yeah, we always had exactly that in the fridge.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.840]   This is what government cheese looks like in America.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.320]   That's it.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.040]   Well, they haven't had this in a row.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:02.880]   That's craft.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.640]   So I grew up--
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.320]   It's elvita.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.360]   We were on food stamps.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.880]   We had government assistance to get food.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.440]   And there was always a giant block of government cheese
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.960]   for years.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.520]   How do they do that?
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.320]   Is there like a government cheese counter?
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.200]   How do they like extrude the cheese?
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.240]   No, like is there a government cheese counter?
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.800]   Throw them out of the back of a truck.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   Is there somewhere you go to get your government cheese?
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.600]   Yeah, so I think my grandmother would go and get them.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   And she would-- yeah, there were like various pantries,
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.080]   and like you can go to community centers.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.360]   There was all sorts of place where--
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.200]   I mean, this was in the '80s.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.200]   Yeah, we--
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   The reason it exists--
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.080]   Because as you know, dairy farmers get big price supports,
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.440]   and there's a lot of excess milk.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.200]   And so they just-- the one way to store milk very effectively
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200]   is to turn it into--
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.880]   Well, give it to poor people as cheese.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.920]   That was my--
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.080]   I grew up storing milk for the US government.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.840]   No, what are you--
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.240]   No, what are you fast?
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.680]   No, what are you fast?
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.400]   Yeah, no, but I have fond memories of it.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.880]   All right, I don't know how we got into that.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.160]   How are we getting into government cheese?
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.160]   Yeah, that seems random.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:03.200]   Looking at Apple MacBook Air, will there be an update on them?
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.880]   Oh, I think it'll be discontinued,
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.840]   although I've heard some rumors that it will be updated.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.560]   It breaks my heart, the MacBook Air.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.800]   I mean, it's the last MacBook that I like.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   The new--
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.720]   Are you-- yeah, they started taking my ports away.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.720]   They bought the keys.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.320]   I'm a convert on the new ports.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.000]   I got the new MacBook Pro, the 15-inch.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.080]   I didn't like it at first.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:21.920]   I thought I would really--
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.320]   I wrote like a little sad letter--
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.400]   breakup letter to MaxSafe.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   Oh, I miss that.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.600]   Because I really miss MaxSafe.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.840]   But no, I've moved on.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.360]   No, I've moved on.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.000]   Yeah, I love USB-C.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.400]   It's great.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.080]   But the Air is-- the screen is very low res,
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.160]   compared to what's happening now.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.640]   But I would love to see a refresh that
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.000]   gives you a retina display.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.600]   But I don't think you will, because that competes
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.240]   so closely with the MacBook.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.680]   I'm also glad they got rid of the glowy Apple in the back.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.400]   What?
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.560]   That's the best thing ever.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.600]   Nope, it's the only--
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.960]   Yeah, it's the only feature that Apple had for a long time
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.120]   that was completely not like customer-centric.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.600]   It was totally for Apple's benefit,
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.560]   had nothing to do with the end user benefit.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.920]   It was upside down originally.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.600]   Well, and you can't see it when you're using it.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.200]   So all it's doing is calling attention
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.760]   to you taking a little bit of power and advertising Apple.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.040]   It was their last non-beneficent feature.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.800]   And now it's gone.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.880]   But how many users do Apple laptops
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.800]   so that the world can see that, hey, look at me,
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.080]   I'm using an Apple laptop?
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.480]   I mean, it's kind of a branding thing.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   Well, it was--
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.720]   Right, but it's not for the user.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.760]   No, of course, but you can't deny how successful it was.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.440]   You would go to a conference.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.320]   You would even go to a Windows event, a Microsoft event.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.880]   And you see all these glowing apples--
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.400]   But this is like maturity and confidence of a company
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.920]   that they don't need to do that anymore.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.880]   Yeah, they're doing what Microsoft's doing with this.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.600]   They've got a little mirrored logo instead of a shiny--
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.800]   I mean, it's still there.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.200]   It's not like they took it off.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:47.840]   So I was glad to see it.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.680]   And the Mac's safe I miss, but USB-C is better.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.680]   Oh, you'll be glad to know the Mac's
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.840]   MagSafe will return in about 12 to 18 months,
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.120]   according to the insider, the Foxconn insider.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:56.960]   All right.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.800]   So the best thing about USB-C charging
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.760]   was that it's really fast, but also the fact
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.280]   that you can plug it on either side, that's a big deal.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.000]   I didn't realize how often--
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   It's huge.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.840]   I'm in an airport on your hotel and being
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.040]   able to plug it on either side.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.280]   For me, that's worth losing the Mac safe.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.920]   Do you like it touch bar?
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.560]   Provisionally, yes.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.160]   I like the idea of the touch bar.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.800]   I use it sometimes, but sometimes it kind of annoys me
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.560]   because I accidentally hit it and send an email.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.760]   That's what drives me nuts.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.400]   I get Siri pops up all the time,
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.120]   and then I move Siri over so you just have a blank space,
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.040]   but I'm still hitting it.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.040]   So it drives me crazy.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.600]   I actually traded down to the touch barless Mac.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.320]   I like the idea.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.120]   And then I bought a Lenovo laptop.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.520]   I love it in keynote.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:37.960]   That's what I heard.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.360]   I love it in keynote.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.480]   So if I'm doing a slide deck, I was just doing
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.680]   to do a slide deck.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.320]   It's like a keynote remote.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.880]   Yeah, but being able to see all the slides and thumbnail
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.560]   and just jump directly to a slide you want,
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.760]   that was actually really cool.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.680]   That's the first use case that I've ever
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.600]   heard that actually makes sense.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.760]   So I was just raising money for all turtles.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.760]   And so I gave a bunch of keynotes
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.880]   and being able to just jump to any slide answering questions.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.920]   So it always looked like the question that was asked
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.520]   was my next slide.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.280]   It was amazing.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:05.560]   Cool.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:06.200]   Magic.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:06.880]   Magic.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.800]   Yeah, actually.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.400]   OK, that's the first thing I've heard.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.560]   They showed a DJ mixing music on this little touch bar
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.240]   on the event.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.640]   What's wrong with a touch screen?
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.000]   You could do everything and more.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.280]   And I'm now so-- it's why I bought all the Lenovo.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.800]   And Lenovo has ports.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.160]   Three USB 2-type C. It has an ethernet port,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.360]   a weird ethernet port, but an ethernet port.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.520]   As a full-size ethernet port.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.720]   What is an ethernet port?
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.800]   Like a token ring port?
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.360]   Like, what do you need an ethernet port?
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.800]   Occasionally there are times you'd like to hardwire.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.480]   Why?
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.400]   Because we have 20 megabits--
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.360]   I mean, sorry, 20 gigabits here.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.040]   And I would like to at least get one of those gigabits
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.760]   into my machine.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.600]   OK.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.360]   It's actually-- we're hardwired right now.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.080]   There are times when hardwire for speed, at least.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:51.680]   Sure.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.560]   And you're right.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.240]   I think most of the time Wi-Fi is just fine.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.360]   Yeah, it's fine.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.240]   I just like I said, OLED screen, it's a touch--
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.760]   I'm really sold on touch.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.880]   You see me doing this a lot.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:00.760]   I mean, it's not-- you're right.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.240]   I'm not all the time.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.200]   It's basically what it is is you have multiple input devices.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.880]   You have a mouse if you want to use it.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.600]   You have a touch if you want to use it on this.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.400]   I have--
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.840]   And you don't get hives when you use windows.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.880]   I used to get hives.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.800]   I've kind of gotten over it.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.720]   I like windows 10.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.520]   It's not so bad.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.680]   Oh, gee, I have to look at this just to see what's going on.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:27.880]   I guess there's a basketball event happening this week.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.080]   Oh, Eddy Q. Why doesn't Eddy Q just fix all the stuff
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.680]   that's broken in his domain rather than telling people
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.400]   to sit down what's going on?
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.280]   So during the Warriors game--
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.720]   Show-- if you go a little--
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.360]   Yeah, there's the--
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.400]   Play that thing.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:41.920]   All right.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.920]   So Rihanna, famous.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.520]   You've heard of her.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.400]   She's a famous--
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.560]   You know, I hadn't, but I listened to her all day.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.520]   She's really good.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.040]   Oh, she's great.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:49.720]   I have heard of her.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.960]   She's a long story.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.400]   Yes.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.960]   She's a Cleveland Cavaliers fan.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.360]   She's not a Golden State Warriors fan.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.840]   They were in, however, in Oakland for the Golden State Warriors.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.480]   Game one of the NBA playoffs.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.640]   It's a basketball thing.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.680]   You would just win another game.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.040]   Sports ball.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.520]   Sports ball.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.000]   So I was born without the gene that makes me care about sports ball.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:05.520]   I know.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.020]   I know.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.640]   Most of the people listening are going in there.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.360]   But this is interesting because it involves Eddy Q.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:10.840]   Right.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.120]   So I guess LeBron James--
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:14.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.800]   Nobody has ever said that.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.160]   Right.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.200]   That's right.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.880]   We're going to make this interesting.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.920]   This is NBA sport ball stuff.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.680]   But we're going to make it interesting because Eddy Q is involved.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.800]   All right.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.240]   That shows you that's-- now you know you're listening to the tweet.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.080]   So LeBron has got a free throw.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:36.160]   Rana jumps up and starts shouting, brick, which means miss it.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:36.680]   All right.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.160]   Really?
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.440]   Now we take you--
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.080]   so she's sounding brick.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.040]   And they're-- what?
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.400]   Eddy Q.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:48.320]   By the way, both of them have multi-thousand dollar front row ringside.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.960]   They call them courtside seats.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.440]   She's shouting at LeBron.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.840]   Eddy Q stands up.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:56.200]   There he is, saying sit down.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.520]   I didn't see that part.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:59.960]   I'm glad they saved it on Twitter.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:04.440]   Well, and then the result is that a million Rihanna fans--
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.600]   she gets half a billion views on her videos on YouTube.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.440]   How could this--
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.840]   if Eddy Q doesn't apologize for his recent misogynistic
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.880]   outbursts towards Rihanna, I'm canceling my subscription
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:17.880]   Apple music.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.320]   So it went viral, and people did cancel their subscription
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.680]   to Apple music.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.000]   And then Eddy Q had to issue--
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:25.880]   An apology.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.320]   Well, he said, I wasn't telling her to sit down.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.680]   I was telling that other girl to sit down.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.320]   He was talking about--
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:32.600]   But why he telling--
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.320]   He was talking about Rissa.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.200]   He was not actually an apology then.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.000]   He's an explanation.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.680]   But why is he telling anyone to sit down?
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.680]   Well, let's look at the--
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.160]   now there's more video, apparently.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.480]   Oh, Rihanna's throwing some shade.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.320]   She was not happy about Eddy Q.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.800]   Well, let's go back to the GIF, because--
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.160]   Joe, who is--
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:57.040]   Eddie Q is another woman in yellow standing up.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.400]   Sure looks like Eddy's shouting at Rihanna, right?
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.720]   But there is that other woman standing.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.280]   And maybe her name is Marissa.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.120]   I think Eddy should just shut up and sit down and watch the game.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.800]   He shouldn't be at the game.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.040]   He should be getting the job done.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:13.400]   He should-- where are the original Apple programs
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.680]   to compete with Netflix?
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.480]   What is he doing?
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.600]   He should be fixing iTunes.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.720]   He shouldn't be having fun.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.960]   There's a lot of stuff he could do.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.720]   I felt more isolated from the human race
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.720]   than during this story.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:23.280]   Let me ask you.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.960]   I just don't understand any of this.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.720]   Somebody who's had products--
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.040]   Eddie Q all the way down.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.080]   Company founder.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.200]   I know Eddie Q is.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.960]   Now, the chat room is saying, I know sports.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.160]   I don't know whether Rihanna or an Eddie Q are.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.840]   We've lost the audience.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.760]   That's actually--
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.720]   It's a funny story, I have to say.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.080]   But is it really reasonable to say
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.120]   Eddie Q should be working not enjoying a basketball game?
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.000]   People should have some time off, right?
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.240]   I mean, that seems like a lot.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.080]   So we're not really saying Eddie shut up and go back.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.080]   Wow.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:04.680]   You know, businessmen who stand in the front row of basketball
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.000]   games make me nervous.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.560]   Well, you saw what happened to Steve Balmer.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.280]   He bought the team.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:17.640]   What about-- you don't see much of Sir Johnny Ive these days?
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:22.160]   The whole Apple executive team--
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.280]   That's really a larger issue.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.760]   And it's where I start to agree with you.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:32.040]   They just seem intellectually lazy these days.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.320]   We talked about this.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.520]   I know you went on for quite--
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.360]   I listened to that whole show.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.280]   You spent half of-- yes, last week's show--
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.400]   ranking on Apple.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.640]   Yeah, people are saying--
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   It's time here.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.720]   That's what we call Mac.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   What do they call it?
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:55:07.480]   Mac Bash, Re
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:12.200]   Yeah, you think it's too much?
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.040]   Well, Mark Newson is doing--
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.280]   I won't compare you to the president of the United States.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:24.440]   But you do have a way of exaggerating your positions
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.920]   to make a point.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.360]   And to entertain.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.840]   But I think it's exaggerating to say Eddie Q should sit down,
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.640]   shut up, and get to work and fix iTunes.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.880]   That's not really your point of view.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.320]   It is.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.920]   It is my point of view.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.600]   Mark Newson, who is Johnny Eis.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.040]   We wouldn't even want to see the keynote.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.840]   Well, I'm never going to get to see the keynote ever again.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.840]   That's for sure.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.000]   Actually, I'm prepared to get on my knees
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.560]   and beg to go to the new Apple campus for September 7.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.080]   Yeah, boy.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.400]   That will be the one to get, right?
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.920]   I've already begged.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.360]   I've gotten near it.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:56.880]   Really?
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.680]   See the leading--
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:58.600]   You brought up the Apple campus.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.440]   Leo, can I make a couple of points about this
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.640]   that have not been made and I really
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.720]   think they need to be made up?
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:04.520]   Please do.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.760]   The first is that people talk about whether they should--
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.400]   we talk about whether Eddie Q should ever have fun.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.040]   People are also talking about whether Apple
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.240]   should be building big fancy headquarters.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.800]   Does this mean the end of Apple?
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.000]   Is this what happens to companies
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.360]   to build amazing headquarters?
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.000]   And that's the beginning of the end, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.800]   I think it has to be said that the new Apple headquarters
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:26.680]   are the new icon.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.360]   They are to tech in Silicon Valley now.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.320]   What the Eiffel Tower is to Paris or Europe.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.440]   And what the big ban is to London, et cetera.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:40.760]   It's an iconic-- it will always be used from henceforth
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:45.200]   as an iconic visual to be shorthand for tech
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.200]   and for Silicon Valley.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.000]   And that's pretty cool.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.400]   The second thing is, if you look at the--
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.800]   there's a mystery around parking at Apple Park.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.280]   They have so much parking.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.520]   They have way more parking than they could ever possibly need.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.360]   If you look at the numbers of parking spots
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.360]   that they have--
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.520]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:05.800]   Plus, Apple's plans to minimize parking.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.760]   Now, there's an argument that says
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.080]   that the city council requires a certain amount of parking
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.720]   for employees, poverty, blah.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.680]   I don't buy it at all.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.640]   If you look at the future of self-driving cars,
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.240]   you look at their plans to have shuttle buses and bicycles
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.040]   and all that kind of stuff, I think
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:26.880]   that campus is actually designed to hold 15,000 or 16,000 people.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:31.200]   And they basically built it so that knowing that they're not
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.280]   going to develop parking is way too much parking
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.280]   and way too low.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.000]   If they went into the city council
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.280]   and said we're going to build a campus that's
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.720]   going to house 16,000 people, I think everyone would have freaked out.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:46.240]   So they said, ah, it's going to be 12,000, maybe 13,000.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.040]   I think this campus is--
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.040]   I think that within three or four years,
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.520]   there's going to be 15 or 16,000 people at this campus.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.560]   So this is designed for big expansion.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:58.880]   And to what end, Mike, does Apple expand?
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.120]   Because they are the world's largest
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.680]   consumer electronics company.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.080]   And they want to get as many people into that headquarters
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:05.600]   as possible.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.240]   But don't they have enough people to make the products they've
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.040]   already got?
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.680]   No, no.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.920]   No, they don't.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.200]   They're always going to grow.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.560]   They're always going to expand.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.320]   And their plan is not to shrink or plateau.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.720]   Their plan is to keep growing and growing and growing.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.400]   And they've already--
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.240]   we all know that they're spread out all over Silicon Valley.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:25.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:28.120]   This is not their only location by any means.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:28.480]   Right.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:28.960]   Absolutely.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.440]   And they're still going to stick to their current headquarters
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.440]   or their former headquarters.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.040]   And they just need all this basic--
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.120]   I'm just saying, if you're going to expand,
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.080]   you've got to have a reason to add those 4,000 employees.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.280]   You know, cars and stuff.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.600]   There's a lot of things they could do.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.640]   Cars?
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.720]   Where do you expand if you're Apple?
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.320]   Where is the sweet spot?
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.160]   Is it Siri?
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.400]   Is it--
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.040]   Phillips said it.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.400]   It's cars.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.320]   Cars are--
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:56.240]   self-driving cars are a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.760]   They're going to become living rooms on wheels.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.560]   And that's a content consumption experience opportunity.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.960]   It's the content consumption experience opportunity.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.800]   And Apple's going to want to be all over it.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.680]   I really believe in that coming to Apple.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.360]   I think if they don't do it--
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:14.080]   Will they make cars or will they just make software for cars?
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:14.680]   What is their--
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.240]   I think they'll make cars.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.320]   They will make cars--
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.200]   They'll build cars.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.680]   That is pretty tough to go up against GM.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.200]   In fact, if forward--
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:23.560]   Oh, it is.
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.840]   And there's even conversation that Elon Musk and Tesla,
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.880]   who have done quite well for themselves,
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:35.520]   are about to enter the buzz saw because now here come the big three.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:40.520]   That they were perfectly happy to let Tesla go for a decade.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.040]   But now it's our turn, kid.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.160]   Get out of the way.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.960]   Mike, what were you going to say about that?
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:51.680]   Apple has been working with the biggest contract
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.520]   manufacture for automobiles, which is based in Germany.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.440]   They've been working for them.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.920]   In fact, there's a couple dozen of their employees
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.840]   trying to find the name now of it.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:06.440]   That contract manufacturer has had multiple engineers working
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.760]   in Apple buildings for a few years.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.240]   And so if you think of--
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.960]   they're looking at cars the way they look at iPhones.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.200]   Apple doesn't manufacture iPhones.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.560]   Foxconn does.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.960]   And so this company is the Foxconn of automobile manufacturing.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.520]   And I think that first of all, I don't think manufacturing
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.320]   is self-driving car, the wheels, the motor,
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.200]   that is not going to be all that difficult.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.640]   The difficult part is the navigation.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.480]   And that's where Apple is seriously behind.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:44.760]   But why would they be working with this company in Austria?
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.200]   Why would they be--
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.200]   if you look at their--
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.880]   I'm not denying that they've shown some interest in this.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.760]   Although we have heard that they're backed off a little bit.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.480]   Well, they've got to have their skis or lean too far.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.400]   They started building the car before they built the system.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.160]   It's space.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:02.760]   It's space?
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.640]   They're going to space.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.480]   Going to space.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.880]   This whole thing is going to take off.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.440]   Well, that's what everyone wants a car.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:07.960]   You know, let's go into space.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.480]   This is a space station.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.000]   Obviously.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.800]   There's obviously rocket motors underneath.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.920]   OK, but this is a question--
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.720]   Obviously, lifting off.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.160]   So maybe you know, Philip, this big circular thing here.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.400]   Is that an ICBM launching port?
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:19.880]   What is that?
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.720]   What is that?
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.200]   It's a pool.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.560]   You know, I've shown this to a lot of architects
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.600]   who are a little bit of gas because it's--
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.360]   Oh, by the way, here's the old barn they saved.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.080]   Oh, really?
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:31.760]   So this--
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.880]   Is that in the circle?
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.520]   Yeah, this was originally an HP campus, remember?
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.280]   This barn was-- this whole area used to be fruit orchards.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.640]   That's why the big mall there is called the Prune Yard.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.880]   It was all plum trees and cherry trees.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.480]   And in 1910, it's not even an old barn.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.400]   At least Connecticut people wouldn't think so.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.760]   In 1910, they built this barn.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.440]   HP preserved it in its campus.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:03.840]   So Apple took it, moved it, bored by bored off the premises.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.200]   And they have now restored it back to the premises.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.480]   Now the construction is over.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.280]   And the barn will survive for no apparent reason.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.080]   I think they promised.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.480]   That's probably the only barn in space when this whole thing--
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.360]   That's because it's an orbit around Jupiter.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.280]   That's probably where the next big apple product is being
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.800]   designed is inside that barn.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.880]   It's right there.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.960]   It's like a tardis.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.800]   It's much larger inside.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.320]   You know, the thing that people always
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.040]   say when they look at that round building is, oh, how
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.080]   inefficient.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.800]   What if you have to meet somebody who's all the way
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.640]   on the other side?
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.120]   He's wanted.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.840]   He only wanted two bathrooms.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.680]   He wanted everybody to walk around a lot so they interact.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.200]   It makes sense.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.880]   I was leading to that story about Pixar.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.480]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.520]   I just stole your story.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.080]   That's OK.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.960]   When he had the same idea in Pixar,
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.320]   he wanted the tech people to interact with the cartoon people.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.720]   And his original thought was, we'll have one bathroom.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.920]   And everybody will have to meet there.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.960]   He got talked out of that.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.080]   I kind of hope they don't make cars.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:01.760]   You hope they don't?
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.320]   I hope they don't.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.520]   I feel like that's a buzz saw that they will have a hard time.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.360]   I hope they don't because I'm bored with cars.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.920]   Well, but someone should make it.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.920]   I'm bored with these cars.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.080]   They don't have one pedal.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.400]   You'd have to either be break or gas to pay.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.240]   You could right click on the pedal.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.600]   Everybody is bored with cars.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.440]   That's all points.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.680]   Self-driving cars are not cars.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.760]   No, they're living rooms.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.440]   They're places where you go to play virtual reality games
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.400]   and to have a video conversation.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.880]   That is the way to get rid of the nausea and cause
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.920]   that virtual reality is to play it while you're
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.680]   in a self-driving car.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.080]   I have to say, nausea, cause, crime.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.080]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.080]   The sickest I ever got was playing doom in a bus.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.080]   Oh, geez.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.760]   That you will really mess with your head.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.720]   I'm just saying.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.520]   I was-- you don't want to know.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.200]   Yep.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:55.840]   Space ships.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.800]   Let's take a break.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.600]   Great panel.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.920]   What fun?
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.680]   We got Philip Elmer DeWitt came all the way out
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.600]   from Connecticut to be with us for N.B.W.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.080]   Massachusetts.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:04.760]   Massachusetts.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.680]   I think he said Connecticut.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.680]   The Connecticut River Valley.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.800]   Is it in Massachusetts?
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.320]   It goes.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.720]   What are they trying to confuse us?
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.480]   It's a border between Vermont and New Hampshire.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.160]   It goes through the middle of Massachusetts.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.160]   It goes through Connecticut.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.360]   It's called the Connecticut River.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.680]   But I live in Massachusetts.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.320]   Is that Western Massachusetts?
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.440]   Yeah, I like Western Massachusetts.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:22.960]   My mom--
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.120]   The five college area they call it.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.480]   Yeah, well, I know where that is.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.600]   Amherst Smith.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.000]   Mount Holy Mass.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:30.640]   Yeah, all right.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.200]   Hampshire.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   Yeah, I used to hang out there.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.120]   Hampshire.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.600]   Also, Phil Libin is here from a brand new company, AllTurtles
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.840]   at all-tradels.com.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.640]   Nice.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.720]   And celebrating Ramadan from his rooftop apartment
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.200]   in Fez, Morocco.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.800]   God, I love saying that.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.200]   Gastroenomad.net's Mike Elgin.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.720]   So you've been--
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.320]   400-year-old building.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.360]   God, that's so cool.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.840]   You did something a couple of nights ago
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.240]   that really sounded amazing.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.600]   You stayed in the desert.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.600]   It was amazing.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:14.360]   And I saw firsthand the tower of the smartphone.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.680]   We went out to the desert.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:20.880]   We went out way to the Sahara part of Mariah.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.560]   There is a variety of--
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.080]   A bunch of--
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   These Berber guys, they'll take you out on this camp.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.680]   And you spend the night, Sarah, out in the middle of the desert
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.200]   in this--
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.400]   like it's amazing experience.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.520]   The guy, the entrepreneur behind this business,
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:48.520]   did everything to smartphones or to phones.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.640]   He had to climb to the highest dune to get connectivity,
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.440]   to confirm reservations, to check travelocity--
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.240]   not travelocity to check what's the other one.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.800]   So check Airbnb books this--
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.080]   no, not Wikipedia.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.120]   Hotels tonight.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.640]   I don't know.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.480]   But he did.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.520]   He read his business from the top of the dunes
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.320]   with his smartphone.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.160]   Yes.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:13.840]   Now, he was right-- he would come down and--
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.960]   Oh, I wish we had better connections.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.840]   Self-driving camel.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.120]   Have you ever been on a camel?
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.320]   Yes.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:20.820]   Me too.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.160]   Quite a thing.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:21.800]   Fun.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:26.560]   We rode one in Cairo up to the pyramids.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.360]   It was really amazing at night.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.280]   Floor flaming torches delight our way.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.960]   The Asian ones are super more comfortable.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.800]   Too homes thing?
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.880]   Yeah, you sit in the middle.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.680]   It's like--
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.180]   It's good.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:36.960]   --actrian or something.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.040]   But they do kneel for you to get on, which is kind of cool.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.960]   They actually-- they're legs.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.960]   We're just stalling while Skype gets better.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.000]   Is it a dramadary or a backtran?
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.800]   I do not know that.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.560]   Is it a dramadary?
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.200]   Yes.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:55.800]   All right.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.720]   Dramadary sounds like the place you don't want
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.960]   to get milk from.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.280]   That's the Arabian 100 camel.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:02.760]   That's right.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.280]   OK.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.560]   The one-home camel's fine, but really it's the two-home
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.520]   camels.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.920]   That's the comfort riding.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.840]   Do you ride on the hump of the one-hump?
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.160]   No, you ride behind the hump or in front of the hump.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.960]   They build a little thing on top of the hump.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.520]   There's a little hump.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.160]   They build it.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.160]   The real guys ride in front of the hump.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.920]   But the two-hump ride on top of the hump.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.920]   They build a special saddle and stuff like that.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.040]   And they have a thing to hang on to and so on.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.880]   If you're a hardcore legit camel rider,
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.600]   there's a way that you sort of loop one of your legs around
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.560]   and you kind of hurt yourself on the top.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.720]   It's harder to do.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.440]   You lose a lot of tourists that way.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.560]   So they build this saddle.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.000]   I've been on the saddle.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.440]   But I have to say, the ride is interesting.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.280]   The gate is unusual.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.080]   You have to kind of--
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.080]   And I have to say that the coolest thing was the stars
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.440]   in the desert at night.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:53.960]   Oh, I bet.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.360]   Was something mind-blowing.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.600]   We saw dozens of shooting stars.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.160]   The Milky Way was almost like it was painted
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.200]   on the sky.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.520]   It was really-- I've never seen stars like that.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.280]   It was really, really a great experience.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.200]   Did they have a tent?
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.120]   Do you stay in a tent or?
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.840]   So they have a camp set up with about eight tents, I think,
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.600]   something like that.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.680]   And we were the only guests.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.720]   There were four Berber hosts.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.840]   And Amira and I were the only guests.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.200]   It made us an incredible tagine.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.080]   The best tagine we ever--
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.440]   [GASPING]
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.440]   Love tagine.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.680]   The bread and fruits kind of stuff.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.480]   And then we played-- they played some music.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.880]   And we all sang songs and played the drums.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.760]   And all the kind of stuff is really cool.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.120]   And then we had a tent, but we asked them
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.360]   to set up a bed outside.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.320]   So we just slept under the stars.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.400]   And they all slept under the stars.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.200]   They just put a rock on the sand.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.760]   And it was amazing.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.280]   And we got up before the sun came up.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.600]   We watched the sunrise.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.400]   And Sarah got back on the camels and rode back.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.960]   It's like an hour ride.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.840]   I said tonight, brought to you by Carbonite Online.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.840]   Back I was just talking about Carbonite and David Friend.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.120]   Carbonite is-- they're rocking.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.440]   And I didn't realize, but I was starting to David the other day.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.680]   They use some pretty interesting proprietary technology
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.240]   to write to the disks.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.720]   They've really optimized it.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:12.200]   So what is it?
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.040]   It's cloud backup.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.480]   But it's cloud backup done right.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.200]   It's automatic.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.040]   It's continuous.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.680]   It's low cost.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.080]   Flat fee.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.520]   They've got plans for home.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.120]   Starts at $59.99 a year, less than $5 a month,
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.360]   for everything on a PC or a Mac.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.800]   But then when you go to the business side, man,
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.920]   the office plans include servers.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.560]   They have a high availability backup.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.920]   So you don't have any time ways to getting back online.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.720]   They have hardware devices.
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.120]   The EVOLT lets you back up locally.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.640]   And then back up to Carbonite, there's the EVOLT.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:50.560]   It is a solution for every business.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.920]   And I'll tell you, it solves the biggest problem in business
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.760]   because you're reliant on data.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.520]   And if your data isn't safe, your business isn't safe.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.080]   And what we generally have to do is look at the want-of-cry
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.040]   people, who just makes you want to cry, who've lost everything,
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:08.440]   businesses, hospitals, 300,000 people a bit.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.040]   Now, if you use Carbonite, you don't
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.520]   have to worry about ransomware.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.040]   In fact, go to the Carbonite site, Carbonite.com.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.040]   Click the Office tab up at the top.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.520]   And look at their resource pages.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.080]   They've got a lot of white papers on ransomware mitigation,
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.800]   protecting yourself against ransomware,
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.040]   protecting yourself against want-of-cry specifically.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.320]   And it all involves having a good backup.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.760]   Every security expert says backup is kind of one of the keys
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.960]   to keeping your system safe.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.720]   Carbonite cloud backup.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.720]   I want you to check it out.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.400]   You can try it free, which is nice.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.480]   Pick the plan that's right for you.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.440]   Go to Carbonite.com.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.560]   No credit card needed.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.520]   But do me a favor.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.840]   There is an offer code when you sign up for the free trial.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.600]   Use our name, Twit, would you?
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.040]   Because then they'll know you heard it here.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.200]   But also, you'll get two free bonus months if you decide to buy.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.400]   You got to back it up if you want to get it back.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.880]   It's all the more important these days.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.040]   Carbonite.com.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.080]   Don't forget to use the offer code.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:06.600]   I think Carbonite is the best named backup service.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.440]   Because it's the Star Wars.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.040]   Well, Empire Strikes Back.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.520]   The greatest movie of all time.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.480]   That was the worst movie of all time.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.320]   You thought the same--
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:15.960]   I'm out.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.440]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.240]   No.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.040]   Seriously.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.200]   You thought that was the best Star Wars movie?
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.400]   It's not that I thought that it's empirically true.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.200]   This is established science.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:24.720]   Oh, no.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.080]   I was thinking the one with Jar Jar.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.880]   That's not the Empire Strikes Back.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.480]   That's the episode one.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480]   That I don't know what that is.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.320]   That was terrible.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.040]   Sorry.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.920]   You're talking about episode five.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.280]   Yes.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.200]   OK, I apologize.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.600]   You got the Empire Strikes Back.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.280]   No, that was a good one.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.000]   That's the one where Luke sleeps in a tantan.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.200]   And they trip up those big walker things.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.040]   That's the one with the best one ever.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.120]   I wish it was cloth.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.280]   I thought they smelled bad.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.120]   On the outside.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.720]   Nice beat there.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.720]   Very well done.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.920]   Very well done.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.920]   Here, I thought Hell froze over to this week.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.640]   It was a shock.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.320]   Google announced, confirmed, they're
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.360]   going to put ad blockers in Chrome.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.240]   And that's good?
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.360]   Well, it's good for Google.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.920]   I realized suddenly, oh, but the one
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.920]   adds that Google's ad blocker won't block is Google's ads.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.240]   It'll block annoying ads.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:18.920]   Annoying ads.
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.520]   And none of Google's ads are annoying.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.520]   How do they decide what is growing?
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.440]   Well, there actually is a group.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.680]   If they're not Google's ad.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.200]   Yeah, that's annoying.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.320]   It's annoying to Google.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.560]   There's a group called--
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.840]   The Coalition for Better Ads in the great tradition
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:40.120]   of naming these industry self-interest groups
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.120]   with a name that makes it feel like it's good for America.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:50.000]   Kabbka, Kabbah, K-buh, whose members include the interactive
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.400]   advertising bureau, the Association of National
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.200]   Advertisers, the Washington Post, Thomson Reuters, Facebook,
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.200]   Unilever, Procter, and Gamble, and--
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.720]   Oh, Procter and Gamble.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:00.680]   Google.
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.760]   That is a party.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   But admittedly, there is a problem.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.280]   I mean, ads have gotten way out of control,
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.600]   because you know what?
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.120]   Here's the real problem, Google, and this is--
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.640]   they'll never admit-- is that banner ads don't work.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.000]   You look at a banner ad.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.800]   And you don't see it, because we've
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.040]   learned how to tune it out.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.000]   So what happened?
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.520]   They had to make them more intrusive.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.160]   They had to punch the monkey for a while.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.840]   And then they had to do takeovers.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.840]   It's got to the point you can't read a page until you click.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.680]   And they move the close box to a different place.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.640]   I mean, it's just got incredibly annoying.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.080]   I honestly don't understand the point.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.680]   Unless Leola Port is reading your ad,
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:34.680]   I don't know why people are--
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:35.200]   I agree.
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.080]   --fother paying for that.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:36.760]   Why do you even bother?
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:37.780]   I'm not against ads.
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.720]   In fact, Mike Elgin, you gave me the best example
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.400]   of why ads supported media and what we do is good,
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.240]   because it's democratizing.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.000]   It means you don't have to have--
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:45.720]   Absolutely.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.680]   You don't have to have money to hear content or read content.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.640]   I don't have anything against ads.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.560]   Absolutely, yeah.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.080]   I do.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.760]   And let me ask you to--
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.920]   there's a behavior that I've noticed in myself,
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.040]   where I have an ad blocker.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.440]   And any publication that pops up a thing and says,
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.240]   you have your ad blocker, I just disable it for that site,
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.960]   just automatically.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.480]   And it works out fine, I guess, so long.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480]   I just leave the publication.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.000]   Do you do that?
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:09.920]   You never come back.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.720]   You hate ads so much that you will--
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.720]   But you understand--
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:13.240]   Most ads.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.720]   And Philip, you run a site that is ad supported.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:16.920]   No, it's ad free.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.120]   That's the point.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.720]   Oh, because you have subscribers.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.520]   I left Fortune because it was becoming more and more
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.000]   intrusive.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.440]   You couldn't read the stuff.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.360]   I think it is possible to have really good ads.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:29.600]   It's possible you occasionally see them--
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.440]   You're just saying that because I'm sitting next to them.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.160]   No, I think it's true.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.400]   But most of the time, it's a pretty bad experience.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   And certainly, most of the time on the internet,
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.600]   it's a pretty bad experience.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.160]   It does have the potential for getting better.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.880]   But as we go more and more--
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.560]   Mike, you were saying this about wearables, right?
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.840]   Soon, we'll just be wearing the tech and our glasses.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.560]   OK, if I'm browsing the internet on a giant monitor
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.760]   on my desktop, like Leo's doing here,
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.920]   OK, I can allocate--
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:56.680]   Then it's not bad.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.520]   I can allocate a few pixels to the ad.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.880]   If I'm looking at it on my phone--
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.320]   More phones in nightmare.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.400]   How many pixels on my phone are we
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.440]   willing to allocate to an ad?
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.200]   Not very many.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.400]   Well, there's also the issue of--
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.080]   What is it in my glasses?
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.160]   How much of my retina am I giving up to an ad?
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.160]   But very quickly approaching zero.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.640]   The big mystery, though, is that we always
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.920]   talk about all the personal data that these companies take,
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.360]   Facebook, Google, et cetera.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.960]   They're harvesting everything.
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:22.920]   They're finding out everything.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.320]   They're following us to the store.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.080]   They're recognizing our faces.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.960]   And they can't give us relevant ads.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.280]   Like, why is that?
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.520]   If you talk about advertising in your glasses,
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:37.240]   if it was perfectly relevant, it was so good that it didn't even
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:37.920]   feel like an ad.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.080]   It just felt like good advice.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.080]   It won't be ads.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:43.480]   It'll be things like you're walking by the gap.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.160]   And something says, oh, hey, you know what?
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:46.920]   You need new pants.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.080]   And you want new pants.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.520]   And there's a great deal on pants.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.400]   You were clearly looking at my pants for you,
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.320]   you said that.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.440]   I just got these pants.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.520]   These are the first new pants I've owned in years.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.640]   Isn't that a nice thing there?
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.120]   Any jeans, come on.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.800]   You're walking down the street and ad you're coming in.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.240]   You're like, you're useful.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.520]   You guys had just put your finger on the fundamental problem.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.480]   This is the Google Paradox, they call it.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.080]   If they really were super useful, they wouldn't be ads.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.000]   If--
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.520]   Let's just say Google knew at any given time
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.760]   what the five most useful things for me to know right now
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.120]   are the five most delightful, useful things for me right now,
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.600]   none of those would be things that somebody would pay for
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.440]   to put in front of me.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.360]   Those are all things that I would pay to see.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.560]   So the better ad targeting gets, the more they become not ads.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.120]   At some point, this idea that someone's
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.640]   going to pay money to interrupt your attention stream
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.480]   is going to be completely in conflict with where
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.520]   the technology is going of actually figuring out what's
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.320]   most important and delightful and useful to you.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.720]   So as of that type, we're totally not sustainable
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.240]   over the next decade or something.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.400]   OK.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.880]   But look, we say along that tape.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.000]   We're going with the Amazon Echo.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.520]   Look, this is absolutely brilliant.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.320]   You actually point their camera at yourself
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:00.760]   and you say, Amazon, do these pants make my ass look fat?
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.040]   And Amazon says, yes.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.640]   But these don't.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.080]   So that's--
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.000]   Maybe the problem is terminology.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   But that's not an ad.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.360]   Right.
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.520]   Because then they're actually going to sell you the pants
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.320]   and make your ass don't.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:11.800]   Exactly.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.640]   But maybe they're selling it from a third party.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.040]   I mean, maybe Amazon--
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:15.480]   No.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.360]   A lot of what's on Amazon is from a third party,
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.200]   if they tell you.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.880]   But look, if Amazon--
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.840]   Does that make it an ad?
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.000]   It's the third party now?
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:22.560]   So here's the thing.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.000]   If Amazon gets money no matter what you buy,
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.080]   they're incented to show you genuinely the best things
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.600]   because they just want you to buy more--
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.480]   They want you to be happy.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.280]   They want you to be happy and you'll make money.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.160]   That's not what advertising is.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.440]   Advertising doesn't want you to buy the best thing for you.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.880]   It wants you to buy the thing that somebody has paid
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.760]   to confirm you because it's not the best thing.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.960]   So if you were the best thing, you would need an ad.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.240]   Right.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.280]   You would just sell it.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.960]   So companies that actually control--
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.600]   It's not true, but OK.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.200]   I'll accept that.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.160]   It's mostly true.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.560]   I think there are a lot of products
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.560]   that you never heard of that may be the best thing.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.080]   That's true.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:54.240]   That's true.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:54.560]   That's true.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.040]   But then you would hear about it through a recommendation,
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.280]   not through a paid placement.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:57.680]   I don't know.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.120]   I find I discover stuff through ads.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:00.320]   Right.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.120]   Because the targeting isn't--
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.200]   Clearly, I'm going to--
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.240]   The advertising was especially on television.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.680]   If you look at Mad Men, that's what the whole show is about.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.680]   Yeah, making swelking.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.480]   No, you didn't want to.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.480]   They're manufacturing--
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.960]   Yeah, they're manufacturing your desire for that product.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.160]   Whereas with all the data collection,
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.360]   they should be able to find out what you actually want,
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.440]   not tell you what you want.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.320]   So this idea that Google Chrome is going
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.080]   to start blocking annoying ads.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.520]   This is what is this coming from?
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.720]   I mean, this is a company that sells ads.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.120]   Is this a rear guard action?
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.440]   Because they're afraid you're going to put a real ad blocker
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.520]   on and block all ads?
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.840]   Oh, I think what it's really like.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.800]   It's actually a great idea because essentially,
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.520]   they brought down the--
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.240]   Google is one of the companies that brought down
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.840]   the price of ads so low.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.080]   And that's one of the reasons ads are so crappy.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.120]   They can simultaneously create scarce--
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:52.680]   scarce, more scarcity by taking people out of the--
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.840]   can't see the ad--
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:58.880]   they'll have all these people blocking ads by default.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.480]   And that makes advertising and reaching the remaining people,
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.280]   I guess, more valuable.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:05.720]   Doesn't it?
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.920]   I mean, it's like--
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.440]   it's a way for them to get monetization,
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.360]   whether you're looking at ads or whether you're not
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.200]   looking at ads.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   I have a fantastic idea for an ad startup.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.680]   I'm going to pitch it to you guys.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.600]   Free?
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.200]   It's actually-- it's fantastic/terrible.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.160]   This is like a half-serious startup idea that I have for ads.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.320]   We're going to scrape your email to find out
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.640]   what you bought from Amazon.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.160]   And then we're going to buy-- as you're browsing,
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.520]   we're going to buy ads.
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.720]   So you see ads for the stuff you already own.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.440]   So imagine--
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.000]   I've never done this.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.160]   And all you're seeing is ads for things you already own.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.680]   That's Amazon recommendations.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.160]   No, no, no.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.200]   That's how it works now.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.560]   You're only seeing ads for the stuff you already have.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.600]   That's how it works now.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.160]   It is.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.360]   That's how bad ad recommendations are.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.280]   But what's the benefit?
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.080]   It's there to make you want the things you have.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:55.920]   Oh.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   It's a confidence builder.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.800]   It's there to make you want the things you have.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.960]   It's the stoic idea.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:00.480]   It's the stoic idea.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.600]   It's the stoic idea.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.840]   It's the stoic idea.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.080]   Like the secret of happiness is wanting what you have.
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:05.600]   Right.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.040]   And who pays for this?
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.320]   That's why it's not a best idea.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.240]   Well, but if you slipped in, you show them nine things
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:14.880]   that they already have.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.680]   Oh, and one thing they don't have.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:17.040]   No, no, no.
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.960]   I see you're ruining the purity of this.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.640]   This is like the way to make--
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.760]   I'm trying to make money.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.600]   All right, maybe you'll like this.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.680]   This is Google-- remember Google had this thing.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.640]   I thought it was very good called contributor.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:30.920]   You'd put some money in, and then they would divvy it out
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.000]   to various Google ad sites.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.720]   And instead of the Google ad, you'd
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.520]   get kittens or whatever you chose to see instead.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.720]   And I thought that was a good thing.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.640]   They discontinued it.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.040]   And this is their new Google contributor.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.960]   You go to a website.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.000]   They've got, I guess, only four so far.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.840]   Grub Street, WWG, comic book, and popular mechanics.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:51.600]   And--
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:52.280]   Bigly, the mechanics.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.800]   I bring spec memories.
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:57.160]   The website says, hey, I see you're running an ad blocker.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.440]   Would you like to buy a Google contributor
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.480]   pass that will remove ads from your site?
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.480]   And you say no, I will not.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.040]   This is--
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:07.440]   I don't know--
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.200]   It's a good idea if they can actually scale it.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.320]   If they can scale it, which is probably--
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.800]   Well, what it does is it does respond to both of you guys
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.640]   who say, I don't want any ads at all.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:18.480]   The problem is there are plenty of products
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.520]   nobody's going to pay for.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.680]   I mean, look what happens with pay
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.720]   walls on a lot of publications, right?
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.560]   Fortune's not going to put a pay wall up
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.280]   because they look at the Wall Street Journal or--
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.960]   They've threatened to put a pay wall up.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.120]   Yeah, and I think they probably thought about it
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.240]   and realized that's not going to make any money.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.040]   It's a bad idea.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.760]   It's user hostile.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:39.680]   But ads are different from product referrals.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.080]   Like--
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.360]   Well, that's what I do.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.880]   I feel like when we do an ad, it's a product referral.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.320]   Yeah, well--
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.560]   It's a word of mouth recommendation for a product.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.400]   I think that's right.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.200]   And I think if you had--
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.080]   So we're very picky.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:54.360]   We pick the clients, the sponsors products we use.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.280]   You are picky?
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.560]   Yeah, oh, yeah, I turn down ads all the time.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.560]   You have to because I consider it an introduction.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.160]   I mean, that's kind of my rationalization.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.880]   I mean, I want to be ad supported media.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.200]   And my rationale is, well, OK, if I'm going to do this,
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.000]   I only want to recommend products.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:10.480]   I believe that--
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.680]   Right, but it's got to be high quality.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:16.240]   And the way that you do it is aligned
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.400]   with the interests of the listener,
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.800]   which is you're trying to make it high quality and entertaining
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.120]   and a net benefit to someone's quality of life.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.000]   Because it wouldn't work if it wasn't.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   Right, and also gives us--
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.080]   So those kinds of ads are good.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.680]   It gives us the chance to pee.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.160]   And thereby being at positive to the quality of life.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.200]   Really, it's the value of ads in general.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.480]   It's the chance to go to the kitchen, get a snack,
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.360]   and then not miss much of the show.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.040]   The funny thing is, I don't think people, for the most part,
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.520]   anymore are watching live broadcasts.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.080]   They're watching on demand, even if they're watching sports ball.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.720]   Sports is about it.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.080]   So, OK, so House of Cards are--
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.000]   Well, that's a bad example, because it's not ad supported.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.360]   But--
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.160]   Oh, Fargo, great show.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.080]   But I'm not watching it live, because I want to skip the ads.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.000]   Well, and sometimes I watch something
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.200]   on demand that has disabled the ad skipping.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.400]   It thrives you crazy.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.360]   I never watch it again.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:07.720]   Right.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.360]   Like, I just-- I can't remember.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.320]   So this is much that makes me angrier than that.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.680]   Yeah, that's a problem.
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.280]   Because those programs are free.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.240]   Programs that are paid for by the ads.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.240]   Them having failed out to figure out a business problem.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.720]   It's not my problem, it's their problem.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.600]   Yeah, no, I understand your point of view.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.880]   I just-- it's scary for me.
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.720]   Somebody sold me a podcast--
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.920]   By the way, podcasts are exactly on demand.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.600]   I mean, what we do is a completely on demand product.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:41.160]   So, presumably, people could skip our ads just as easily
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.360]   as they could skip a DVR.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.640]   Which aligns the incentives to actually make them
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.520]   like good and entertaining and informative,
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.240]   so that most people don't skip them.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.120]   Exactly.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.360]   Where we do a tease at one end, and then people
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:56.880]   stay through the ad to the other end, which never was.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.800]   Or you have the live blog, you know, the live chat.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.800]   Well, we have live, but you know, it's only--
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.720]   it's a tiny fraction of the total audience that watches live
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.840]   and is in the chat.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.680]   That's less than 10% of the audience.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.520]   And we don't know how to monetize it.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.920]   So even though those people are compelled to watch the ads,
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.360]   we actually can't make any money off of them.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.560]   We're only the people who could skip the ad.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.920]   And we just hope that they don't skip the ad.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:26.160]   Well, one of the things that we need in podcasting
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.440]   is to know a lot more information about whether people
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.360]   are skipping, what parts-- when they stop listening--
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.880]   I really don't want to know that.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.360]   I really don't want to know that.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:40.080]   Well, no, I think you do because if people--
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.160]   I mean, I monitor my own behavior.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.640]   And there are some podcasts I listen to.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:46.720]   And I love the podcast.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.840]   But I skip the ads because they suck at reading them.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.720]   On Twitch shows, I don't skip the ads.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.320]   I listen to them because they're all--
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.720]   You brought just so down.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.800]   No, I'm curious to hear the new information.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:01.600]   It's mixed up.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.320]   And there's a lot more energy put into it.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.080]   So a lot of podcasts, they just sort of--
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.680]   you can tell these people doing the podcast
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.720]   are being dragged, kicking, and screaming into doing that.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.160]   The ad, they don't really want to do it.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.440]   Because they don't know the company, and so on.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.600]   And so it's like--
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.640]   it would be fantastic to know when people are leaving,
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.920]   when are they skipping.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.200]   I think podcasters really need to know that stuff.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.120]   I think it would improve podcasts a lot.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.960]   The other problem I have with a lot of podcasts out there--
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.440]   is that people start a podcast and it's like 20 minutes
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.920]   of like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.200]   and they don't get to the point.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.120]   It's like I don't have that kind of talk.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.320]   I would like to be able to tell them, look,
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.920]   get to the content.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:46.920]   You know what I mean?
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:50.160]   I don't want 25 minutes of hearing about your sandwich
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:50.800]   or whatever.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.320]   Yeah, it's funny, because when I first started doing this,
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.240]   that was a really high priority value for us,
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.280]   was not to waste listeners' times.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.440]   And I think over time, I've stopped doing that.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.400]   I just waste your time like crazy.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:04.880]   I apologize.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.680]   It happens.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.200]   No.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.200]   You know what, the very--
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.320]   For me, I'm getting a little sloppy,
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.400]   because I just like talking with--
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.680]   every one of these shows is with friends,
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.400]   and often that I don't see very often.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.520]   So I'm catching up.
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.360]   But I probably shouldn't waste our audience's time
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.000]   with catching up.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.400]   I should get right to the--
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.640]   See, but that isn't-- I don't think that is--
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.480]   like I like that.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.440]   What bothers me is when they don't have new guests,
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.840]   it's the same two people.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.840]   Yeah, and that is boring.
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:37.880]   I don't care about your relationship so much
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:38.880]   is the content.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.720]   And five minutes is fine.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:41.280]   20 minutes is fine.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.680]   That's a broadcaster value, which is--
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.520]   The attention that you're given by your audience
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.800]   is the most valuable thing.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.640]   And so you've got honor in that.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.040]   That's fine.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.920]   It sounds like you just resent sandwiches.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.080]   I've started to do some--
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.000]   It'll be like sandwiches better than I do.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.240]   I'm a big sandwich fan.
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.320]   What's wrong with sandwiches?
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.080]   There's nothing better.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.120]   Nothing.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.000]   I started to do some podcasts.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.360]   And I'm just not as loose as you are.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.640]   So I feel like I'm really old-fashioned about it.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.360]   I write my questions down ahead of time.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:13.960]   I try to--
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.880]   You're formal.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:17.720]   I'm just lazy.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.440]   It's not that I'm loose.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.080]   I'm just lazy.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:19.760]   It's too much work.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.120]   You've done it long enough.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.480]   You know how long I've been doing this?
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.320]   You don't even want to know.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:23.960]   I do want to know.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:24.800]   40 years.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.320]   Wow.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.440]   Not podcasts.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.200]   But I don't even think podcasts are any different than radio.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.440]   This is-- I've always done this.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:34.320]   How much of that was radio?
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.080]   Well, podcasting only really started in 2004.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.760]   So 20-- what is that?
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:40.360]   27 years.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.360]   I can't do the math.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360]   You know, when we--
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.600]   So Leo, you're in a perfect position
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.160]   to answer what is to me the biggest question of all.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.840]   Why isn't everything a podcast?
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.840]   Like, why isn't every show--
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.280]   why does radio still exist?
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.640]   There's a lot--
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.480]   Why does radio still exist?
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.760]   Well, it's radio still exists.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.160]   The only reason radio still exists
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.640]   is basically the car-- frankly, the car.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.960]   Because there's very little radio
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:10.600]   listening outside the automobile.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.720]   And that is a very short-term thing.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.280]   Already, music radio is suffering.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.760]   Because--
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.320]   But I'll tell you why it's not dead
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:25.240]   is there is a value to having somebody keep you company
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:28.920]   in your car that is alive and right now, as opposed
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.880]   to prerecorded.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.200]   And I think that is something genuine.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.400]   I mean, isn't it nice to watch live TV or listen to live
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.120]   radio know that that person's doing this right now?
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.120]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:41.920]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.640]   It's companionship.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.640]   That was always the reason for radio is companionship.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:51.160]   I think NPR and BBC have a model for radio that works.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.400]   Oh, I just loathe it.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.080]   It's so--
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:53.600]   So you really--
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.520]   pompous.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.200]   It's so formalized.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.200]   See, where I live, if you ask people--
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.040]   I ask people, where do you get your news?
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.880]   And they're all listening to NPR all the way along.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.800]   I was listening to an interview I was very interested in.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.840]   And I love Terry Grosser.
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.400]   This is not to knock her.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.840]   It's more to knock the format, the structure.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.200]   She was interviewing the son of George Martin,
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.400]   the Beatles producer.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.720]   Because of the 50th anniversary.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:18.200]   The 50th anniversary.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.040]   I was very interested.
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:19.640]   I just bought it.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:20.920]   I was really excited.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.200]   She reintroduced him.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.440]   In 25 minutes, five times.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.440]   And not just like--
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.200]   I'm talking to Clintus Jones.
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.560]   It's like a long--
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.800]   she's clearly reading.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:36.160]   And this is "Formatics" probably dictated by NPR.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.680]   I doubt-- well, maybe Terry does do that.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   But he's pretty old.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.520]   He pissed me off because I was interested in her subject.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.400]   And I wanted to hear him talk.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.480]   I didn't want to hear him reintroduce him.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.240]   And it makes no sense on a podcast.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.720]   It only makes sense on broadcast.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.240]   Because it's only on broadcast that somebody might show up.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:55.160]   If you're listening to a podcast, I don't need to re--
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.120]   I re-interest you guys more because it's a chance to plug you
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.880]   and acknowledge you and thank you for being here.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.320]   But if you've tuned in this podcast, you better--
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:04.680]   you know by now who Phil Liven is.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:08.080]   If you've stuck with this podcast this long,
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.520]   you figured it out.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.280]   By now, you know who these people are.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.920]   And there's that strange guy cut from Riyadh,
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.600]   or wherever, I don't know.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.280]   Up on the rooftops, just singing in the praises.
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:23.680]   Let's take a break because I haven't done enough ads yet.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.720]   But we will have more with Mike Elkin.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.720]   See, I'm doing the reintroduce.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.720]   I don't really need to, do I?
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:30.560]   I think it's a more accretacy, you guys.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.680]   Like, I just acknowledge that you're here on the show with us.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.160]   And I'm grateful, right?
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.160]   You know, we did a podcast--
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.080]   It's a nightmare mind, people.
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:42.920]   We did a podcast that ever known, which was pretty--
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:43.640]   a lot of fun.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:44.480]   Did it for a few years.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:49.040]   And our entire stated goal was we want our podcast
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:52.720]   to be more popular than Leo LePort's least popular podcast.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:53.720]   That wouldn't be hard.
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.360]   I have some very unpopular podcasts.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:55.840]   We made it.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.240]   We made it like once or twice.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:57.760]   Like, on the iTunes--
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.120]   I didn't even know what my own--
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.200]   Oh, because on iTunes.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.480]   That's not real, though, because that's billboard style.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.440]   That's a weighted chart based on a number of subscriptions.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.800]   We were just going-- we just said,
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.600]   we want our podcast to be more popular than Leo's least
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.040]   popular podcast than iTunes.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.520]   And we made it once or twice.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.160]   Congratulations.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:12.840]   I forget what it was.
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.320]   It was like--
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.320]   Well done.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:14.320]   --it was like--
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.320]   --it was like--
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.320]   --no, but you understand that--
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.320]   --pond pilot podcast.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.320]   --that's just like--
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.160]   Yeah, like 50 of it, though.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.880]   --that's subscriptions this week.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.400]   It's not--
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.480]   I choose not to understand any of that.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:25.760]   In fact, my podcast do very poorly now,
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.440]   because everybody who wanted to subscribe to subscribe--
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.440]   --it's been a long time ago.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.440]   --it's been a long time ago.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:31.920]   --fue are new subscriptions than many podcasts
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:32.960]   that have far fewer listeners.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:33.960]   Be that as it may--
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.960]   Does that make sense?
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:35.960]   --be that as it may, my best--
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:36.960]   --and what you want.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:37.960]   --my best was better than your worst.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.200]   What was it?
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.400]   Your worst podcast?
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.400]   It's like this week in Fava Beans or something.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:43.400]   I don't know.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.200]   Yeah, we had to stop doing that one.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:45.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.700]   It had a terrible idea.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.680]   But what is the measure for-- is there something better
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.080]   than iTunes to measure numbers?
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.080]   Do you have numbers?
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.640]   Oh, we know, because we have to measure numbers.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.640]   The advertisers want to know, and that's how we sell it.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.560]   And what do you use to measure them?
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.640]   Well, we have been going through a company called PodTrack,
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.880]   which is a podcast advertising agency that offers free metrics.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.000]   But we actually also do our own numbers.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.920]   We had first thought-- you know, it's traditional in broadcast media
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:11.360]   that no one would-- if I were a radio station, and I said,
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:14.240]   well, I could tell you how many listeners you wouldn't trust me.
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.120]   So there is Arbatron and Nielsen.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.080]   There's third party independent kind of certified measure.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.120]   Just like the-- for magazines, the advertising ABC,
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.960]   right, the circulation bureau.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.120]   That's an independent metric.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:30.000]   But it turns out in podcasts, they, for some reason,
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.600]   they do trust podcasters.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.000]   Most podcasters just say a number, and that's that.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.240]   Oh, that's good to know.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.400]   Yeah, just make it up.
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:40.800]   In fact, I know people are making it up,
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.560]   because I look at some of the numbers people quote,
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.640]   and I go, that's impossible.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:48.360]   There's no way they have those kinds of numbers.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:52.400]   So you could say that that's a failing of podcasting,
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.960]   that there isn't this kind of independent metric.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.680]   I like it.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.800]   But we don't lie.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.400]   We actually under-- we intentionally underestimate,
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.440]   because we don't want to get in a situation where
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:04.920]   we're inflating numbers.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.360]   But see, I believe, based on my own listenership
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:13.280]   and viewership, that you are better than anyone else
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:16.320]   at keeping the audience listening and watching.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:19.200]   And that's why I think you benefit enormously
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:23.040]   from metrics about how people-- how much they listen all
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.920]   the way through, or how if they listen halfway through,
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:27.160]   or whatever, that kind of thing, if that were measured
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.480]   and were made public.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.960]   There's a cautionary tale.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:33.880]   For a long time, the way radio was rated
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.240]   was you would get a diary.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.520]   Maybe some of you have received a diary that
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.240]   said write down your radio listening at the end of the week
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.000]   mail it in.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.600]   And of course, nobody does.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.120]   It's one of the reasons I think Rush Limbaugh did so well,
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.080]   is that people were fanatics about Rush Limbaugh.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.240]   Even if they didn't-- you kind of look like Rush Limbaugh.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:50.800]   Oh, God.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.120]   That's the worst one I've ever heard.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:54.120]   Put that together.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.680]   Sorry, Phillip.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:59.680]   But so shows that had devoted followers
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.640]   to do much better, because nobody ever recorded
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.200]   their actual numbers.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.600]   At the end of the week, come and go,
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:06.800]   oh, crap, I got to mail this back.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.080]   I want my $5.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.240]   And they just write Rush Limbaugh Rush Limbaugh
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.640]   right across the board.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.800]   And so shows with devoted fans would do very well.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:18.680]   Then, Arbitron, the company that does this,
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.280]   invented the people meter.
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.480]   Remember, Nielsen does this.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.880]   They have a box in your house that would measure.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:24.920]   Well, they came up with a way--
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:27.120]   The company is actually called Arbitron.
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.320]   There's Arbitron and Nielsen.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.240]   Arbitron is the one that does most of the radio stuff.
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.000]   It's suspicious at a company that's
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.360]   trying to give you a good status called Arbitron.
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.480]   Because it's kind of arbitrary.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.360]   It's a little bit-- that is an odd choice of name.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.560]   It's not what I would have gone with.
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:43.600]   So Arbitron figured out a way of actual metrics.
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.840]   It's a good of a precision--
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.240]   It's a sad thing that happened.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:50.640]   Across the board, stations had far fewer listeners
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:53.000]   than they ever saw from the diaries.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.520]   It was-- this happened about 10 years ago,
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.680]   a massive depression in audience ratings.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:04.680]   And surprisingly, like for instance in Los Angeles,
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:06.000]   all of a sudden the number one station
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.400]   is a Spanish language station.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.160]   Wonder why.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:10.760]   It makes sense.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.720]   When they start measuring it accurately--
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.840]   maybe I'm the Spanish language station in this story, Mike.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.200]   Maybe I would benefit from accurate measurement.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.000]   But maybe not.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.120]   So let's not, OK?
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.080]   You have a ton of really own impact.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.360]   Yeah, it drives LA radio stations crazy
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.560]   that you'll often hear them say, we're
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.120]   the number one English speaking station.
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.520]   I'm like, drive some nuts.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.440]   But the truth can be painful.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:42.360]   Truth hurts sometimes.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:46.160]   Phil Limin here, it's great to have you from allturtles.com
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.680]   with a dash in the middle from Morocco, from Feds.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.080]   And I apologize for the audio quality.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.600]   But I'm so glad to have you on, Mike.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:53.560]   It's worth it.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.360]   Mike Elgin, gastronomad.net.
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:56.360]   It's glad to be here.
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:02.240]   And Philip Elmer-Dawitt is making his first in-studio appearance,
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:03.520]   which is so nice.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.720]   P-E-D-30.com.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:07.240]   So happy to be here.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:10.240]   I'm glad you called and said, we're going to be here for WWE
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:10.760]   CSF.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:11.760]   This is fantastic.
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.200]   You don't really look like Rush Limbaugh.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.200]   Good.
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.720]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.680]   Just like Rush Limbaugh.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.480]   We had a great week.
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:21.120]   We have a lot of fun stuff to show you
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.680]   as we put together this little highlight reel from the week
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:25.880]   on by on this week in tactical.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.880]   Previously, on to it.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.440]   Before any of these maneuvers.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:32.040]   I have phased the range at full capacity.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:32.600]   I don't know if that's--
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:33.120]   So much fun.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.120]   --beens anything.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.120]   Yeah, everybody do something.
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:38.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:40.560]   We saved the Surabachi.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:41.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:42.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.560]   Security now.
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.240]   The attack of the subtitles.
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.520]   Researchers at Checkpoint have discovered a new attack
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:55.320]   vector by crafting malicious subtitle files.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:00.280]   Attackers can take complete control over any type of device
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:03.600]   via vulnerabilities found in many popular streaming
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.960]   platforms.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:06.480]   The new screen savers.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:08.320]   That robot's name is Botler.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.640]   And there are actually a handful of these robots deployed
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.600]   in hotels across the country.
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.400]   It's a relay robot built by a company called Savio here
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:16.760]   in Silicon Valley.
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.360]   Twit.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.840]   Now with half the calories.
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.040]   Hey, Colleen, I was just thinking,
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:25.520]   I got these Death Star plans.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:28.280]   Could you just jam them in there, wedge them in there?
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.120]   There it is.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:29.640]   There it is.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.280]   Help me.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:31.440]   It doesn't--
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.120]   Jam it.
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:32.600]   Push it.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.520]   There.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.200]   Jason Howell, what's coming up this week?
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.160]   Coming up this week on Monday, June 5th, Apple's Tim Cook
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.200]   will take the stage at the Worldwide Developers
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.400]   Conference to showcase not only its big developer
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:50.120]   initiatives as expected, but also perhaps some new hardware,
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.440]   including its much rumored series
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:56.160]   speaker that would compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.960]   On Tuesday, June 6, Google is expanding its ways carpool
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.480]   service from the Bay Area and limited areas surrounding
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.920]   out to the entire state of California.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:06.720]   And who knows?
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.040]   Maybe someday you'll be carpooling with ways in your neighborhood,
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.520]   sometime down the line.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.600]   On Thursday, June 8th, Yahoo!
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.040]   shareholders placed their vote on whether to sell Yahoo's internet
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.440]   business to Verizon for $4.48 billion.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.840]   No surprise at this point.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.240]   A yes vote is expected.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:26.600]   And if that happens, it would mark the end of Marissa Mayer's
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.280]   time as CEO of the company.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:30.120]   And that's just a look at a few things
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.760]   that we'll be tracking in the coming week.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.600]   Join myself and mega-moroni on tech news today, every weekday,
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:39.480]   at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern here on twit.tv.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.920]   Thank you, Jason Howell.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.760]   Resume made some good money for her brief tenure.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.000]   50 million a year, something like that.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.360]   That's nice work if you can get it.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.840]   I know we're putting her in the top 200.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:50.920]   I know that's true, though.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.160]   Isn't that silly?
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.640]   Isn't that sad?
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:55.320]   I am going on vacation tomorrow.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.320]   We've got great people filling in for me.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:00.840]   Next week, Jason Calicanis will be hosting--
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.160]   who's hosting the following week?
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.000]   Is Jason Snow?
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.440]   Snow is next week.
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.600]   Now, next week, Calicanis, we decided
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.080]   to have only people who named Jason
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.480]   hosting the show for the next couple of weeks.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.680]   So, Jason, Snow next week, Jason Calicanis the week after.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.600]   The thing I'm going to miss--
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.800]   my mattress of all things.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:19.400]   I'm looking forward to going with you.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.600]   I'm not taking my-- I could, though.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:24.000]   Startup idea.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.240]   I could have a Casper sent to the hotel in Lima.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.800]   Nice segment.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.480]   The Casper mattress is the best mattress in the world.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:34.240]   There are an online retailer, Premium Mattress,
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:35.840]   is made in the US.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:39.880]   And because they're made in the US and sold directly to you,
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:42.040]   there's no markup, no department--
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.440]   department store is double the price of everything--
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.520]   no mattress store markup.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.120]   So you're going to get a great mattress
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.760]   for a fraction of the cost.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:53.960]   Obsessively, engineers made of supportive memory foams.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.320]   It's hard to describe this, and this
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:58.840]   is why I want you to try the mattress, because it has--
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.440]   it's got sync.
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.560]   You're comfortable.
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.240]   It's not hard, but it's firm.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.400]   How could something-- I don't know.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.600]   You just have to try this.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.280]   It sinks a little, I guess.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.240]   And it's breathable.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.800]   So as summertime's coming, it's going to get hot.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.000]   You want a mattress that helps you sleep cool,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.120]   because we know you'll sleep better if you're cool at night.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.080]   Not too hot, not too cold, just.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:20.440]   Right.
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.120]   Long lasting, too.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.560]   Great comfort, great support.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.520]   You buy it online, and here's the most important thing.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.080]   It's completely risk-free.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:29.880]   We're not talking about going to a mattress store
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:33.040]   and lying in broad daylight with your shoes on and a mattress,
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:34.960]   while the salesperson gives you the stink I
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:37.640]   were talking about taking the mattress home.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:41.240]   And actually, they ship in a very surprisingly compact box look.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.440]   And you open it up, it comes out, and they give you--
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.480]   there's wrapped in Tyvek.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.720]   They give you a little cutter.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.280]   It goes, whoosh.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.640]   And then suddenly, this beautiful mattress.
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.360]   It doesn't smell like rubber or anything.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:53.720]   It smells fresh and delicious.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:56.160]   And it's-- well, you might worry.
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.280]   You know, it's been in the box.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.680]   I eat it.
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:01.760]   And then you got 100 nights.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:04.240]   You sleep on it for 100-- any time in the first 100 nights,
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.800]   if you're tired of this-- this mattress is not right for me.
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.560]   They come and get it and take it away,
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.560]   refund you every penny, cost you nothing.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.480]   There's no risk.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.440]   You've got to try it.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.600]   Free shipping, free returns in the US and Canada.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.440]   But not Machu Picchu.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:21.680]   Unfortunately, not Machu Picchu, or the Galapagos.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:23.520]   I'm just going to have to suffer.
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.080]   But you know, then it's one--
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.240]   traveling's great because when you get home,
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.160]   it makes you appreciate--
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.840]   and you're getting your own bed.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.840]   With my Casper mattress, my bowling branch, she's
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:33.800]   like, oh, I'm home.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.000]   I feel so great.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.840]   Save an additional $50 on your mattress
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:40.160]   if you go to Casper.com/twit and use the promo code TWIT.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.040]   That way they know you heard it on the show.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.200]   Casper.com/twit, promo code TWIT.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:48.280]   You win and we win because you get $50 off.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.960]   Terms and conditions apply.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.640]   Thank you, Casper.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:52.440]   Which came first?
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.520]   Casper, the friendly ghost?
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.040]   The mattress came second.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.560]   Casper, the ghost, is older.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.800]   But Casper, ghost spells it AR, right?
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:02.920]   C-A-S-P-A-R, Caspar.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.120]   Or is it Casper?
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.080]   I don't know.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.320]   Or Casper, Skie.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.440]   Spell the same.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:08.400]   Says here.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:09.640]   Supportive memory foam.
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:12.920]   Much better than judgmental memory foam.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:13.520]   Much more relaxing.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.320]   Thank you for holding that thought.
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:15.840]   I know.
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:17.360]   I know.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.880]   It was almost unbearable.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.600]   WWDC picture on your website.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.120]   Where is it?
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:25.640]   You go to the very top.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.480]   OK.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.520]   This is the building.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.200]   And then read more.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.400]   What is wrong with them?
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:30.960]   What is that?
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.480]   This is the McHenry Convention Center, the San
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.840]   Convention Center.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:38.520]   I took S there in 1978.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.800]   I took it in Manhattan.
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.080]   That was good, wasn't it?
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.240]   It was good for a couple of years.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:45.080]   It got me to where I am today.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.200]   But that's where I took it.
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.680]   Yeah, doesn't it look like it broke out?
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:48.520]   Like a--
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:49.080]   What are those things?
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.480]   That's what my face looked like as a teenager.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.840]   What are those things that they look like?
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.840]   Those little people shot from the top.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.640]   Oh, it's people shot from the top.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:58.160]   But no one really knows what it's about.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:02.760]   Apparently, there's a centred around a dot.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.920]   Do you think they're going to release an Apple drone?
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:05.920]   No, it's going to be a jetpack.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.440]   This guy's clearly in a jetpack.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.080]   Look at him.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.320]   I think it's an AI.
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:10.240]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.800]   That is clearly a jetpack.
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:13.360]   Is this the Apple jetpack?
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.200]   The Apple jetpack.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.880]   And who are these people?
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:18.920]   He's holding-- are they-- is he flying?
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:24.000]   Apparently, they lifted this idea from some art show.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.160]   This is OK.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.240]   Up close, you get it.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.600]   But from a distance, you're right.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:28.920]   It's not obvious what that is.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:29.520]   It looks kind of--
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.520]   And they covered like the--
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.800]   I don't know what the light rail is called in San Jose,
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:38.280]   but the whole station's covered with it.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.840]   This is the view from the Apple jetpack.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:42.360]   We're finally going to get-- we were promised jetpacks.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.080]   Apple's finally--
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.280]   Yeah, when we get our jetpack tomorrow--
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.640]   So all the long gone here is--
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:47.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:48.800]   And they've closed the street off
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.640]   to make San Jose safe for developers.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.280]   Wow.
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:55.120]   That's nice to have that kind of money, right?
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.000]   I think they're going to-- this means they're going to do a drone.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.160]   I'm going to be the first to say it.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.840]   Oh, look, there's a guy in a wheelchair.
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.320]   You can tell from the top.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:02.760]   Oh, that's a little--
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:04.800]   Yeah, that's inclusive, right?
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:07.160]   But you can't tell what race any of these people are.
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.160]   So there's nothing here that says "series speaker."
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:14.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.200]   No, you're right.
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:19.120]   Must be a false rumor.
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.120]   All right.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.960]   That's what it's AI, though.
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.840]   What time is it in Fez?
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:24.840]   What was it?
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:27.880]   It was 11 minutes after midnight.
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.240]   So is it calming down?
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:30.760]   No.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.080]   It should be starting up at all.
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.480]   Is the sugar is it burning off the kids?
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.920]   They're having a little more--
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:36.920]   No, right.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.120]   They're going to go all night.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:39.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.520]   Here they are.
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.240]   Wow.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.720]   Uber has decided to fire Anthony Levodowski.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.840]   This was controversial hire.
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:50.680]   Levodowski worked at Google on Waymo.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:53.520]   The Google self-driving car, he then
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.400]   went to Otto, which was his own startup self-driving truck,
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.840]   Uber bought Otto and hired Levodowski,
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:05.160]   and then got sued because, strangely enough,
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:08.800]   the LiDAR on the new Uber self-driving cars in the Otto
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:13.960]   looks suspiciously like the invented at Waymo LiDAR that
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:18.840]   cost 1/10 what LiDAR normally costs.
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:24.640]   The courts told Levodowski that he had to turn over information
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:26.840]   that he had evidence.
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.880]   He asserted his Fifth Amendment right
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:31.280]   to avoid self-incrimination.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:31.800]   Ooh.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.240]   A lot of people do in that these days.
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.520]   Yeah, that seems a popular.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.840]   I'm going to remember that.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:40.040]   I have declined to testify on the grounds
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:42.280]   that I might incriminate myself.
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:45.080]   I would like to plea the Fifth.
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:46.440]   The beautiful thing about the Fifth
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:51.440]   is that you can't actually imply guilt from it.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:53.000]   Yeah, but you do, obviously.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:53.480]   You shouldn't.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.520]   Arnold said it kind of makes the whole Constitution pointless.
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:56.800]   Yeah, but you do.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.840]   I mean, I know the jury and the judge don't.
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:01.440]   But everybody else goes, he did it.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.760]   That's what Sessions said before he was asked to testify.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:06.040]   He did it.
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.960]   Anyway, Uber had been pressuring him
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:10.720]   to hand the materials over to cooperate.
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:12.480]   He missed an internal deadline to do so.
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.520]   They fired him.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:15.400]   So he's gone.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.520]   700 million they paid for that properly.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:23.240]   So that puts the Marissa Meyer thing in perspective.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:27.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.160]   And let's see.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:33.400]   Waymo is also looking at trucking.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:34.400]   So is Elon, right?
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.120]   Elon says he wants to do a truck.
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.320]   Well, those are the guys who are going to be out of work.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.120]   The truckers.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:40.880]   Truckers first.
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:41.760]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:44.200]   Hey, Leo, did you see Logan, the movie Logan?
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.200]   I did.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.360]   They did such a great job depicting the future of self-driving
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:49.880]   trucks.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:50.960]   I thought that was perfect.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.560]   It's exactly what's coming.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.080]   I must have fallen asleep in that part.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:54.680]   What happened?
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.840]   Also, the future of adamantium claws.
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:57.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.800]   Yeah, well, obviously that's going to happen.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:03.200]   They perfectly depicted a world where all the trucks are
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.960]   self-driving.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:05.760]   They're all in a row.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.080]   They're sort of responding to accidents and things like that.
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:10.520]   It was really well done.
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:12.000]   It looked so believable.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.200]   And I think that's-- I think trucking
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:16.200]   is going to be one of the first implementations
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.840]   of self-driving vehicles.
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.400]   Makes so much sense.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.920]   Already truck drivers are pushed to the limit.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:22.840]   They're exhausted.
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:26.720]   They tend to be often dangerous drivers and so on like--
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.560]   because they have such big vehicles.
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.720]   And they're on to the--
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:35.360]   But if anybody is still going to see the movie Logan,
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:39.000]   check out the detail with which they depict
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.920]   this world of self-driving trucks.
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:41.800]   It's really--
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.320]   It's so funny.
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.960]   I think we just saw the movie.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:44.920]   I don't remember that.
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.400]   I haven't seen it yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.040]   The chat room thinks he's-- you've
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:51.600]   confused Logan with Mad Max?
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.680]   It's a little short clip in there.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.200]   Were the horses get loose?
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.800]   Oh, when the horses get loose.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:47:59.200]   OK, I don't want to--
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:02.080]   You know, I didn't really like it.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.560]   I was just waiting for that one scene
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:06.160]   where the little girl just whips up on all the bad guys.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:09.520]   And then after that, I just kind of went back to my game.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:09.880]   So--
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:11.720]   What were you playing?
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:12.960]   Fieldrunners attack.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:15.160]   In fact, I should really get back to it.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:17.560]   Because, well, all right, we're done here.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.480]   We have an alliance event.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:22.360]   And I haven't really earned my stars this week.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:24.880]   But let's see.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:28.720]   So there was a big-- there was a big thread of information
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:30.640]   about Twitter, fake Twitter followers.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.260]   It was prompted by somebody who said that Donald Trump,
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:35.520]   half of his followers, were fake.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.640]   They're Russian bots.
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:38.080]   They were Russian bots.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:39.960]   But I think--
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.440]   I'm a Russian bot.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:42.520]   He is a Russian bot.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.380]   I think, in fact, it's always been half of the one Twitter
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:47.940]   or fake.
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:48.420]   This is half--
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:49.620]   It sounds like it's an improvement.
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.780]   That sounds low.
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.900]   I think it's normally around 1/3, actually.
[01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.500]   Half is very much on the high side.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:02.380]   It tends to range between 20% and 40%.
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:06.100]   Half is really on the high side for a major account like that.
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:08.220]   I don't think you blame--
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:12.100]   I guess the implication is that maybe Trump's team
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:13.180]   bought followers.
[01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:15.460]   But I think if you're the president of the United States,
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:18.860]   you probably get all the bots automatically, right?
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:19.860]   You just get all the bots.
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:24.020]   Someone told me that half the hits are bots.
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:28.500]   I feel like there are people with 70% bot followers.
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.780]   I really do.
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:31.700]   There is a site--
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:33.500]   I don't know how they would figure out if you're bots.
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:37.100]   But there is a place you can do to audit your Twitter.
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.820]   And somebody ran me, and I think I'm 30% bot.
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:41.780]   That is not something I'm going to do.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:42.980]   You don't want to know.
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:45.300]   No, I mean, I'm sure it's 90% for me.
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:46.340]   The LinkedIn--
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:47.060]   I have some reason.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:48.620]   Why would someone follow me?
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:51.460]   For some reason, I have 130,000 LinkedIn followers.
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:54.380]   And there's a way to see where they're from.
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:56.740]   And they were mostly from these little African countries.
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:58.700]   What's your Twitter handle?
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:49:59.380]   Twitter?
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:00.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:00.860]   He doesn't even know.
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:01.540]   What's your Twitter?
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:03.300]   He elmered to it.
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:03.740]   Oh, there it is.
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:05.100]   It's on the screen.
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:06.500]   It's Philip E.D.
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:07.700]   No, that's Twitter.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:08.460]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:10.060]   What?
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:11.140]   Sorry.
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:12.340]   That's your details.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:14.100]   Self-driving trucks in Logan.
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:14.900]   They were amazing.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:17.060]   I never saw them.
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:18.380]   All right, I don't know.
[01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:19.300]   OK.
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:20.380]   81%.
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.740]   You're very good.
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:22.620]   All right, fine, do me.
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:26.460]   You only have 2,799 fake followers.
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:27.140]   According to Twitter--
[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:29.180]   How many do I have total?
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:31.820]   You have, it says 12,171.
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:33.140]   So Philip, what's your--
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:34.100]   Plibit.
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:35.140]   Phil Libin.
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:35.860]   Just Plibit.
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.940]   P-L-I-V-I-N.
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:39.660]   Let's just run this.
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:41.140]   And you are 90%.
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.100]   You are really good.
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:42.460]   Oh, it only--
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:43.180]   Tail.
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:43.940]   Wow.
[01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:44.700]   Wow.
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:45.180]   Wow.
[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:46.260]   How many total?
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:47.060]   OK, my total--
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:47.820]   27,000.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:48.820]   Wow.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:52.420]   @Mikeielgain.
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.620]   And you're 85.
[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:54.380]   OK, so--
[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:55.820]   I have more human than all of you guys.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.340]   So let's see @realdonald.
[01:50:58.340 --> 01:50:59.380]   That is not what I would expect.
[01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:01.380]   Trump.
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:02.780]   Now, this will take a while.
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.380]   See, 47% real.
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:06.620]   So maybe it is a story.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:09.300]   Let me do Leo Laport.
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:11.460]   Do this with some trepidation.
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:12.460]   Me and Donald.
[01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:13.780]   Yeah, you're down there.
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.220]   Me and Donald, I'm only half real.
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:17.180]   I'm not a real boy.
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:19.940]   What's your total, though?
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:21.100]   200 and--
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:22.620]   Oh, see, this is--
[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:24.140]   oh, you have to add those up.
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:26.260]   So it's close to 600,000, I think.
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:27.060]   Wow.
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:28.620]   You are popular.
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:29.100]   Well done.
[01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:31.620]   Well, no, I'm not, because half of them are fake, still.
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:32.460]   But still.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:32.860]   Fake, still.
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:34.100]   They're just AIs.
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:37.500]   You appeal to a certain kind of artificial intelligence.
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:38.500]   It's probably as well.
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:39.500]   It's probably as that potus.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:40.260]   I'm not interested.
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:40.740]   50% also.
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:42.700]   See, I figure it's not--
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:44.260]   He's in the millions, though.
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:46.860]   Yeah, but the reason is because if you're at potus,
[01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:49.660]   or at Real Donald Trump, every bot follows you.
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.940]   If you're running a Twitter bot,
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:53.860]   you're going to follow those people, right?
[01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:54.460]   How does that work?
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:55.420]   Why would you do that?
[01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:55.780]   Why does that--
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.380]   I never understood that.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:59.780]   What's Taylor Swift's handle?
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:04.420]   Because she's like big, right?
[01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:06.220]   No, no, I don't know what's going on.
[01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:07.780]   I think they want me to have to sign up.
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.540]   So anyway, we're done.
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:10.460]   That seems delicious.
[01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:10.820]   All right.
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:11.980]   We're done.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:15.140]   I'm 90% human.
[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:17.380]   That's more than by weight.
[01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:18.060]   That's pretty good.
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:19.020]   Yeah.
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:21.180]   At Taylor Swift 13.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:23.660]   Oh, I didn't do her real, real handle.
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:25.460]   OK.
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:28.500]   Supreme Court, kind of-- you know, this was a big decision
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.540]   that I didn't think got a lot of coverage.
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:33.100]   The Lexmark case.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:35.940]   So this was decided in the Supreme Court this week
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:39.140]   by an 8 to nothing vote.
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:42.980]   The Supreme Court was hearing a case about a company
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:47.980]   that was re-selling, taking Lexmark cartridges, refilling them.
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:49.220]   Is there printer cartridges?
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:51.060]   Printer cartridges, inkjet cartridges.
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:54.540]   A company named Impression Products was refilling them.
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:58.660]   Lexmark sued, saying we have the patent on this,
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:00.340]   and you can't refill them.
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:05.220]   The Supreme Court decided against Lexmark by 8 to nothing.
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:08.460]   Actually, it ended up bidding revised because Ruth
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:12.180]   Gaet-Bader Ginsburg said, well, OK, yeah, I agree,
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.900]   except it should be US only.
[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:17.620]   The 8-nothing decision was originally US and overseas.
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:22.100]   The point being that a patent and patent rights
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.300]   expire upon sale.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:28.940]   In other words, if you buy something, you own it.
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:30.500]   This is huge.
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:31.460]   This is a big deal.
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.420]   This is a big deal.
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:33.620]   I was surprised to get more coverage,
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:36.620]   maybe because it seems so technical.
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:37.580]   But I think it really--
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:39.860]   It's not the word Lexmark in it.
[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:40.380]   It could have been--
[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:42.420]   Where else does it apply that it becomes huge?
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:44.540]   Well, I think it has a lot to do with the right to repair
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:47.580]   movement, because Apple, for instance,
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:51.220]   would very much like you to have to buy repairs and parts
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:52.300]   from Apple.
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:55.620]   That's why they used weird screws.
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:58.220]   This would, I would think, could be used to defend people
[01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:00.620]   who say, no, no, you own that phone.
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:02.020]   Is it going to hold up when we actually
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:04.420]   have fully self-aware robots that we can buy?
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:11.060]   You know, you ask a really interesting question.
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:13.540]   Maybe we should just wait and ask the self-aware robots.
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:15.580]   We should wait until they're on the Supreme Court.
[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:17.020]   When they're on the Supreme Court.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:18.540]   I think it's time, by the way.
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:20.420]   I just want-- I want a robot rights.
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:22.900]   It's time we got a self-aware robot on the Supreme Court.
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:23.500]   Absolutely.
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:25.380]   The government jobs-- forget the truckers.
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:26.260]   It's the government jobs.
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:27.180]   This should be the first to go.
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:27.780]   I think you're right.
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:29.580]   If you've ever been to DMV lately--
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:30.660]   Oh, boy.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:31.740]   What do you think of--
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:35.180]   things that you've been good at, like politics?
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:38.580]   Yeah, like making arbitrary decisions.
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:40.100]   Our robot overlords.
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:41.420]   Well, who's it?
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:44.820]   Bill Gates says that robot makers should
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:46.900]   be taxed for the jobs that they--
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:47.940]   Yeah, that's nuts.
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:49.140]   He says robots should be taxed.
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:49.740]   Robots.
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:50.900]   The robot maker.
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:52.420]   No, the robot's themselves.
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:53.340]   The whole thing is nuts.
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:54.860]   It's crazy.
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:56.660]   The tax situation is all upside down.
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:59.460]   You should tax consumption, not production.
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:00.940]   You should tax things you don't want.
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:03.660]   Not things you do want.
[01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:04.540]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.820]   What would be the thing I don't want?
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:08.060]   We should tax things that--
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:11.260]   Like, when you tax something, it reduces it.
[01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:13.660]   So you should put taxes on things that you want fewer of.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:14.620]   Vice taxes in the works.
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:15.860]   Well, whatever.
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.340]   Not that you want more of.
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:19.700]   This isn't really the show to debate taxation, but--
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:19.900]   Yes.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:20.940]   Speaking of Bill Gates--
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:22.220]   Also, I don't know much about it.
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:22.660]   Oh, god.
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:23.540]   This was too long.
[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:24.140]   Couldn't read.
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:24.820]   I tried this one.
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:26.940]   Oh, I will summarize because it's fantastic.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:27.940]   OK.
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:29.100]   I tried to read it.
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:30.220]   This is from Hacker Noon.
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.460]   This is a guy named Terry Crowley, who worked on the Office
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:35.420]   Division, wrote an article on where Microsoft
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:37.980]   took a wrong turn in the '90s.
[01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:39.740]   And it really was Longhorn.
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:41.860]   And Bill Gates decided--
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:44.020]   and this is the fascinating thing in here--
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:48.900]   at some point, Bill Gates decided that HTML and the Rich
[01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:53.860]   Web had no future, that in fact, Windows presentation layer,
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:57.740]   Avalon, was the future of middleware.
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:03.180]   And spent untold amounts of developer time and effort
[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:07.340]   on building up Avalon and Vista and in deprecating
[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:07.980]   the browser.
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:09.980]   In fact, most of the internet explorer team
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:15.220]   was moved off IE and over to Avalon.
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:16.260]   I remember that.
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:18.260]   Kind of a spectacular misunderstanding
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:19.420]   of what the future would be.
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:20.820]   But it was still Microsoft.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:23.140]   I mean, that's the way they saw things.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:24.860]   The whole history of Microsoft, he writes,
[01:56:24.860 --> 01:56:28.180]   from its origin, is about the primacy of software over hardware.
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:29.780]   Hardware is a commodity.
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:32.620]   Value lies in software.
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:35.180]   And it's actually, I think, the supremacy
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:37.020]   of the buyer versus the user.
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.980]   If that's actually-- it's interesting you should say that.
[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:40.740]   Because--
[01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:42.300]   Which is like the opposite of what Apple--
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:44.420]   Apple's always been about the person using it,
[01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:45.660]   not necessarily the person buying it,
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.300]   although when Apple's case is mostly the same person,
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:49.740]   Microsoft's been about the buyer, not the user.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:50.460]   Right.
[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:51.900]   The buyer, not the user.
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:52.940]   What are they doing?
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:53.940]   Yeah, it's an actual case.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:55.140]   It's always like corporations.
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:56.140]   Yeah.
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:57.140]   Yeah.
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:58.140]   Interesting.
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:00.500]   The other thing I found fascinating,
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:03.980]   the reason I found this article, is because the guy who took
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:06.620]   over after the debacle that was VISTA,
[01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:09.980]   Steven Sanovsky, who created the Windows 7 team--
[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:10.900]   Big fan of Steven Sanovsky.
[01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:15.140]   --heavily annotated this and recommended this article.
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:17.420]   And so there is a second story going on
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:19.780]   as you read the article, because what you're seeing,
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:22.100]   really, is Sanovsky is no longer at Microsoft.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:23.340]   He can kind of speak his mind.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:24.340]   So there's an interesting--
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:25.180]   And Drives and Horowitz now.
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.180]   As you go along, there's underlining.
[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:30.660]   That's one of the things I like about Medium.
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:32.820]   You can see what other people have picked out.
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:34.300]   I'm not seeing them right now, maybe,
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:35.500]   because I have an ad blocker on.
[01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.300]   But there's underlining.
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:42.220]   So you can see what Sanovsky says is really the issue here.
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:47.020]   And in a way, the second story is the successor at Microsoft,
[01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:51.740]   Steven Sanovsky, and what he really thinks.
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:53.180]   But he did it all with underlining.
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:54.220]   Anyway, it's worth reading.
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:57.740]   It's on hacker noon.com, which is a medium.
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:00.140]   I wrote a note to Steve Ballmer at the time
[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:01.860]   when they first announced Vistos.
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:03.780]   Because Evernote was a big Windows product.
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:04.660]   Yeah, well, still are.
[01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:05.180]   Yeah.
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:07.040]   But everyone wrote a Ballmer at the time,
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:09.140]   saying that I see where they were going with the name,
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:12.180]   because Vistos sort of a Windows-y name.
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:13.820]   But I thought it was a missed opportunity.
[01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:16.380]   If it was me, I would have gone with Windows Pain.
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:18.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.540]   I would have been there.
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:20.620]   Sounds like the inventor.
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:21.900]   So Sanovsky might say this.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:25.700]   I never heard back from the bottom of the note.
[01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:27.060]   Well, what's happened, of course,
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:30.220]   is that the operating system now is really no longer important
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:30.720]   at all.
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:32.300]   It is, in fact, the presentation layer.
[01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:34.260]   And the winner was the web.
[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:36.380]   And that's why you could do something like Chrome OS.
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:37.380]   Yeah, pretty, pretty, pretty system.
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:38.660]   It doesn't even care about the operating system.
[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:40.140]   Operating system is pretty important.
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:41.980]   It's about to get a lot more important than the platform.
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.220]   Well, here's--
[01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:44.460]   OK, so here's my contention.
[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:46.620]   The platform is the browser and the web.
[01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:48.620]   I don't care-- and then one of the reasons I'm using Windows
[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:50.100]   now is I don't care if I'm on Mac OS.
[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:52.700]   Windows are Chrome OS, because most of what I do
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:55.820]   is in a browser, right?
[01:58:55.820 --> 01:58:56.900]   You disagree with it?
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:58:59.100]   Until you get hit by a WannaCry or something like that.
[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:00.020]   And that won't happen.
[01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:02.260]   Yeah, that's different on mobile.
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.140]   Interest.
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:04.500]   Is it different on mobile?
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:08.860]   Well, we haven't had the right operating system for AI yet.
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:09.620]   And I think that's cool.
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:10.660]   Oh, boy.
[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:12.860]   Let's take a break and talk about that.
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:14.140]   We're almost done.
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:17.060]   Operating system for AI.
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:18.060]   Hmm.
[01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:18.580]   Listen.
[01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:19.500]   What does that mean?
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:21.820]   I'm learning Lisp.
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:22.780]   I used to--
[01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:23.780]   I used to--
[01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:25.300]   I'm halfway through SICP.
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:25.740]   I'm ready.
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:26.460]   I'll be ready for you.
[01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:27.900]   When you need me, just call me.
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:28.860]   I'll come in.
[01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:30.900]   I can fix the 2038 problem.
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:31.940]   Nope, no problem.
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:35.100]   I learned Lisp from Paul Graham's book.
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:36.460]   Did you really have a great book?
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:38.140]   And on Lisp.
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:38.860]   On Lisp, yeah.
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:40.820]   And then it took me like 20 years
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:43.020]   to realize there was the same Paul Graham.
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:44.300]   And I got him to sign it.
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:44.820]   He's amazing.
[01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:45.940]   He's not being-- I got him to sign it.
[01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:46.940]   So it's like--
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:47.940]   All his books are made.
[01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:50.380]   One of my price possessions.
[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:51.780]   That's a smart guy.
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:52.940]   Super smart guy.
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:56.060]   Our show today brought to you by my shave.
[01:59:56.060 --> 01:59:57.420]   By Harry's.
[01:59:57.420 --> 02:00:00.460]   A great shave for a lot less than you're paying.
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:01.420]   About half what you're paying.
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:02.740]   Father's Day is just around the corner.
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:05.380]   Ooh, this Harry's would be a great Father's Day gift.
[02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:07.340]   I gave it to my son for graduation.
[02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:09.060]   Oh no, for Christmas.
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:10.100]   And he loved it.
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:14.900]   I have to say, Harry's knows that dads are tough to shop for.
[02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:17.860]   Do not give dad a tie.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:21.100]   Unless Tad has a big bushy beard that goes all the way down
[02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:24.460]   to his chest and never uses a razor.
[02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:25.940]   You might want to take a look at Harry's.
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:28.780]   Actually, get one for yourself and then give one to dad.
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:30.140]   And the grads.
[02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:33.220]   Harry's is all about a great shave at a fair price.
[02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:34.780]   They bought the factory in Germany.
[02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:36.900]   This is a great startup story.
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:39.020]   Harry's founders got a little money.
[02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:41.460]   Probably from somebody like you, Phil, an angel investor.
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:43.060]   That's why there's an elephant on the package.
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.820]   How do we disrupt-- is there really?
[02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:46.020]   Yeah, right?
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:47.660]   Oh, is that because of you?
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:48.660]   No.
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:49.660]   It's actually a mastodon.
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:50.300]   It's a mammoth.
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:51.220]   Yeah, it's a mammoth.
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:51.780]   Yeah, it's a mammoth.
[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:52.300]   Woolly mammoth.
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:52.780]   Yeah.
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:53.740]   But they don't want you to be a woolly.
[02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:55.660]   Products with elephants on them are better than products
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:56.700]   without elephants on them.
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:58.140]   So they got all the money and they said,
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:00:59.660]   how do we disrupt the shaving industry?
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:03.220]   It's really clear that it's fact, it's even an adage.
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:04.940]   The model is you give away the razor
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:07.300]   and you make it up on the blade and these blades are way over
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:08.100]   priced.
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:09.460]   They realize the best thing we could do
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:11.380]   is buy the factory in Germany that
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:13.420]   makes the blades and sell it direct.
[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:14.740]   So that's what you get.
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:20.020]   You get amazing, well-made blades designed to work great.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.020]   It'll give you a close, comfortable shave
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:24.020]   and you get it for about half the price of those blades
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:24.940]   in the drugstore.
[02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:26.820]   Actually, I shouldn't say that anymore because you can actually
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:27.820]   find Harry.
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:29.180]   There they are, Jeff and Andy.
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:31.500]   You can actually find Harry's in the drugstore now,
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:33.060]   which I was really pleased to see.
[02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:35.180]   But you still get that great price.
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:38.500]   The Harry's kit will get you started with the razor
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:42.620]   handle, the moisturizing shave gel, three of Harry's, five
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:46.140]   blade precision engineered razors.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:48.220]   They have a limited edition Father's Day shave kit.
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:49.700]   I don't think I have that here.
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:51.220]   Maybe I do.
[02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:53.420]   Show it on the-- yeah, no, this is the orange one.
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:54.340]   This is the beautiful.
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.140]   It's beautiful.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:57.500]   It's a storm gray razor handle.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:59.900]   Plus, you get the chrome razor stand.
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:02.180]   You get the foaming shave gel, three replacement blades.
[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:05.260]   The travel cover, which I will use tomorrow and I use all
[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:08.380]   the time, it's really a great idea to keep yourself
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:10.700]   and get in cut when you reach in your shaving kit
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:12.540]   to get your blade.
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:13.260]   I love it.
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:15.420]   Plus, it comes in a sleek, giftable box.
[02:02:15.420 --> 02:02:18.420]   You can even add custom engraving and a personalized car
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:18.740]   for free.
[02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:20.140]   This is a nice gift.
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:24.460]   And right now, I'll get $5 off.
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:27.860]   Actually, any shave set at harry's.com/twit.
[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:29.020]   Sean Parker's back.
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:32.620]   You know, he has a plan to let you rent movies that are still
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:36.260]   in theaters for $50.
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:38.100]   Hey, I support this.
[02:02:38.100 --> 02:02:38.620]   This is great.
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:40.020]   Would you do-- I guess so, because it's
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:41.780]   like $13 to see a movie.
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:44.020]   Yo, let me have someone over.
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:46.340]   Like, I'm actually really angry that you still
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:47.180]   have to go to movies first.
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:48.740]   And the whole movie distribution thing,
[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:49.660]   like, pisses me off.
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:51.940]   He created Napster, Music Industry.
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:54.460]   Didn't like that too much.
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:56.860]   But his new thing in the Hollywood
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:02:58.700]   doesn't like it too much again.
[02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:02.620]   His premium video on demand is new acronym PIVOD.
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:06.140]   That's a word.
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:07.380]   That's a winner.
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:08.780]   PIVOD.
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:10.260]   Well, the company's called Screening Room.
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:15.660]   So you rent the movie instead of the inexpensive $4
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.620]   for a movie that's had been out and out of the theaters
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:20.700]   and months later.
[02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:23.660]   You rent it for 40 hours for $50.
[02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:26.180]   20% goes to the movie's distributor.
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:27.820]   A theater chain-- I guess they're
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:29.860]   going to work with theater chains would get up to $20.
[02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:31.380]   Each customer would get two tickets
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:34.380]   to see that title at the theater.
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:36.220]   Screening room takes 10%.
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:37.220]   Yeah, I think it's great.
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:38.100]   There's basically nothing--
[02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.060]   I love this idea.
[02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:41.100]   There was no upside to sitting in a dark room
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:42.980]   with random people that you didn't choose to be with.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:44.860]   You probably have a nice home theater, too.
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:45.660]   I used to.
[02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:46.580]   Not anymore.
[02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:47.020]   I used to.
[02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:49.180]   Who's the smell of popcorn?
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:51.820]   That's because--
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:52.300]   I don't--
[02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:55.620]   What's happening in Fez?
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:57.300]   Sounds like a new party is started.
[02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:03.980]   This is lost control of the movie.
[02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:04.980]   This is Fez.
[02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:08.940]   I love this one.
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:11.660]   I use delicious-- remember delicious?
[02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:14.740]   Joshua Shachter's great bookmarking site
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:16.260]   got bought by Yahoo!
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:19.140]   Yahoo! managed to kill it pretty good.
[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:22.980]   Then the guys who started YouTube bought it--
[02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:25.060]   weirdly enough-- then they didn't want it.
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:29.980]   So they sold-- it's been sold five times.
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:32.140]   Five times.
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:33.820]   The YouTube founders bought it in 2011.
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:36.180]   They sold it to Science Incorporated in 2014.
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:40.580]   Science sold it to Delicious Media in 2016.
[02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:43.220]   And now, during this whole process,
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:44.900]   when Delicious was bought by Yahoo,
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:48.700]   I moved to Pinboard, because the guy who does Pinboard
[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:50.540]   had this great model.
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.700]   If you get in early, you pay less.
[02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:54.700]   And as more people use it, his server costs go up,
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:56.100]   you pay more.
[02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:57.020]   I've been very happy.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:59.540]   It's called this to my $12.
[02:04:59.540 --> 02:05:02.300]   He must be doing all right, because he just bought Delicious.
[02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:03.300]   There you go.
[02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:05.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:08.100]   Mach-ege, I don't know what you plan to do with Delicious.
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.140]   He doesn't really need it.
[02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:10.900]   He's duplicated the Delicious API.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:13.380]   It's completely compatible with Delicious.
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:14.820]   But it's such a cool service.
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:15.380]   It is great.
[02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:17.380]   Apparently, all your bookmarks, if you use Delicious,
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:18.300]   are still there.
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.900]   They didn't delete anything.
[02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:24.300]   So maybe there'll be some future for Delicious.
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:25.060]   Speaking of Delicious--
[02:05:25.060 --> 02:05:26.740]   We actually considered buying it.
[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:27.220]   We talked to them.
[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:27.740]   Did you really?
[02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:28.260]   We did.
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:29.140]   Yeah, I never know.
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:29.980]   So years ago--
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:31.020]   Would have been a great buy.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:33.180]   Would have been, yeah.
[02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:34.780]   Came very close.
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:35.780]   Didn't you?
[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:36.660]   I use Pinboard.
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:38.460]   All of this stuff is in Pinboard.
[02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:40.420]   And then I use Zappier to automatically put it
[02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:43.660]   into a spreadsheet so that we have to run it.
[02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:44.700]   You know what's funny, though?
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:47.820]   I mean, Delicious looms large in all of our minds,
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:50.140]   because at some point it was the flavor of the month,
[02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:52.900]   and it was the new hotness and all that stuff.
[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:55.380]   You're looking at 2008 or something like that.
[02:05:55.380 --> 02:06:01.260]   It only acquired 5.3 million users.
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:05.340]   Compare that to Facebook or any social anything nowadays.
[02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:08.940]   That means it's amazing how tiny it was
[02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:13.340]   compared to how big we remember it.
[02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:18.260]   And I think we remember it because we were tech journalists.
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:20.220]   Maybe we were doing stuff.
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:22.460]   Yeah, we're going to wrap it up.
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:25.260]   I need to wrap it up, too.
[02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:29.140]   I think it's time to have a little quiet thank you
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:32.060]   for our fabulous hosts.
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:34.740]   Mike Elgin visiting us from Morocco.
[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:35.940]   Wow, that was cool.
[02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:37.380]   Find out more about Mike and Amirah
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:40.260]   and what they're up to at gastronomad.net
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:42.140]   and read his great writings in computer world.
[02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:44.980]   I didn't even get to your fabulous article, which
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:47.580]   I talked about on the radio show,
[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:50.740]   about why businesses should prepare for a laptop band.
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:53.420]   Not that it's imminent, but when it happens,
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:55.580]   it will happen because there was an incident.
[02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:57.380]   And it'll happen like that.
[02:06:57.380 --> 02:06:59.540]   And all of a sudden, you won't be able to carry laptops
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:00.900]   on an airplane.
[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:02.300]   It'll be like sneaker bomb.
[02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:04.100]   It'll be a huge deal.
[02:07:04.100 --> 02:07:04.900]   And so Mike--
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:06.860]   And one of the reasons it'll be huge
[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:09.100]   is because you probably won't be able to put it
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:10.820]   in jet luggage either.
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:12.180]   Yeah, because that's even more--
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:12.740]   That's the thing that--
[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:14.660]   That's dangerous, too.
[02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:19.380]   There was a fire in Lithium-ion batteries, first in flame.
[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:22.100]   But fortunately, they were on in the cabin
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:23.140]   where they could be dealt with.
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:25.300]   Had it been in the hole, it might have been a hole in another matter.
[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:26.020]   Yeah, you need--
[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:29.180]   There were 30 services in the airport laptop rentals.
[02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:29.620]   Yeah.
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:30.180]   Exactly.
[02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:34.900]   But there were 33 fires from devices last year in the United
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:37.660]   States alone that were reported.
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:42.860]   And so imagine if half of those had ignited in the hole
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:46.580]   where crews couldn't put it out with a fire extinguisher.
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:48.940]   Read Mike's piece is really good in computer world,
[02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:51.220]   especially if you are a business,
[02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:52.700]   and you do a lot of business travel.
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:54.740]   This is something you need to prepare for.
[02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:56.260]   No question.
[02:07:56.260 --> 02:07:57.460]   Phil, living good luck.
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:00.460]   I'm so excited you were here the day before your new company,
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:03.740]   all-turtles.com.
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:06.220]   It's been two hours of not having real responsibility.
[02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:07.620]   So I'm pleased to have shared with you.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:08.900]   You have to report to the office in 9am,
[02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:09.540]   tomorrow morning?
[02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:09.980]   I do.
[02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:10.180]   I do.
[02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:10.180]   I do.
[02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:11.060]   I've got to be there at 9am.
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:11.660]   Nice.
[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:13.100]   Yeah.
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:15.260]   We've got to talk about fasting sometime, but not today.
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:15.700]   Mm.
[02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:16.340]   Because I got to run.
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:17.500]   Because I got a plane to catch.
[02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:18.780]   I'm going to get out of here.
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:20.420]   But thank you so much for being here.
[02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:21.540]   Thank you for asking me back.
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:21.540]   Thank you, Matt.
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:21.940]   Great.
[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:23.060]   And you come back any time.
[02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:23.620]   Thank you.
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:25.620]   And I extend exactly the same offer to you.
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:26.580]   Philip Elmer-Dewitt.
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:27.540]   Always nice to see you.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:28.900]   Have fun tomorrow.
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:31.300]   How early are you going to get in line?
[02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:33.500]   Well, I don't have to get in line because I have a press
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:34.060]   pass.
[02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:35.420]   Ooh, I've heard about that.
[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:38.700]   But the line is where you get all the best info.
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:39.500]   I suppose.
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:39.860]   I don't know.
[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:41.860]   We're from the developers.
[02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:42.980]   Nobody knows nothing.
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:44.620]   But I'll have to work.
[02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:46.740]   I have to type while it's happening.
[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:48.900]   We'll watch with great interest.
[02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:51.820]   We'll follow your blog at ped30.com.
[02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:55.940]   And of course, we'll have our own streaming coverage tomorrow
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:09:00.900]   morning, 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern, 1700 UTC.
[02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:03.220]   I'm always rooting for Apple.
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:05.260]   I want them to be the apple of your.
[02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:07.580]   I just fear that there's not that they don't have what it
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:08.860]   takes to become the apple of your.
[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:11.660]   I think I have to believe either they
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:15.740]   will deliver at some point things that will wow you
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:17.620]   or it ain't going to happen.
[02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:19.940]   They're just going to ride the phone into the sun.
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:22.140]   We've seen that happen before with Apple.
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:23.660]   We've seen it happen with many companies.
[02:09:23.660 --> 02:09:25.060]   It's kind of the way it is.
[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:27.660]   What's amazing with Apple is that they've come back.
[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:28.420]   Yeah, they had it.
[02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:30.260]   They had a second act.
[02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:31.220]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:34.540]   We do this week in tech every Sunday, 3 PM Pacific, 6 PM
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:36.140]   Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:37.900]   I won't be here for the next two weeks.
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:39.420]   Good news, great co-hosts.
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.500]   We let them put together their own show show.
[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:42.460]   It's always interesting.
[02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:43.940]   Jason Snell next week.
[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:46.220]   Jason Callicannis, the week after.
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:47.260]   It should be a lot of fun.
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:49.820]   And I'll be back in three weeks.
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:53.300]   And in fact, I'll be back on June 19th, I guess,
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:54.900]   to do all the shows as usual.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:56.580]   So I hope you'll join me then.
[02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:58.380]   And I hope you'll watch next week.
[02:09:58.380 --> 02:10:01.300]   You can always get the shows on demand at twit.tv
[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:02.860]   or wherever you subscribe to podcast.

[02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:07.580]   Thanks for joining me.
[02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:08.980]   And we'll see you next time.

[02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:17.540]   All right.
