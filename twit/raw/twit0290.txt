[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300]   We chew it over, we mull it over,
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.300]   we perhaps send it to our second or third stomachs
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.300]   and chew it and mull it until it is finally formed into a paste
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300]   and then we make milk out of it.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.300]   No wait a minute, that's a cow.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300]   I'm sorry about that. Let me start over again.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.300]   This is just horrible.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.300]   Take two.

[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.300]   I never do that.
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.300]   Even the dog was like, "What the hell?"
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.300]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.300]   It's been three weeks, I'm a little rusty.

[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300]   It's time to talk about the tech news of the week.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.300]   I am back and I want to thank Tom Merritt for doing such a great job
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300]   for me while I was gone.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300]   Episode 290.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.300]   Now I missed a couple, but we have a great panel joining us right now
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.300]   starting with Cara Swisher who actually came to the studio with her dog Phineas.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.300]   I did, hello.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.300]   Very nice from allthingsd.com.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.300]   This is the brains of the operation.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.300]   Phineas is?
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.300]   Yeah.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.300]   He's actually about the most adorable dog I've ever seen.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   I really...
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   I'm at the town and I urge everybody to adopt dogs.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.300]   A rescue dog.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.300]   Rescue dog.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.300]   Oh, is he a sweetie.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300]   Also joining us...
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   I'm sorry, IaaS-actar.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   It's great to see you, IaaS.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.300]   Hi, guys.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.300]   How you doing?
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   First time on Twit, IaaS is a writer for PCMag and also hosts his own podcast
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.300]   called ThisOldNerd.com.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.300]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.300]   Occasionally you'll see me on that other show TNT.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.300]   And a real regular on TNT.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.300]   If you're an old nerd, what am I?
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.300]   To Crap It.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.300]   I was thinking of more of an Internet time kind of old because I've been doing this
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.300]   for about 20-something years now.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.300]   Oh, yeah, that's pretty old.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   That's old.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.300]   Hey, it's old.
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   And also joining us right now, Mr. Ome Malek.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.300]   He's home from his travels all over New York for a while, I think.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.300]   Just today.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.300]   Just today?
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.300]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.300]   It's certainly worth it.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.300]   I was totally worth it.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.300]   New York is all this birthday.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.300]   I love New York.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.300]   GigaOme.com.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.300]   So, Kara, you had to scoop with a week this week because...
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   I guess it's last week this week.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.300]   I don't know.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   You, on all things D, announced that Apple was going to announce the iPad 2 on March 2nd.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   You stand by that because we've seen the invitation now.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.300]   Yes, I think I'm standing by that.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.300]   There is a little curl.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.300]   Because there is an iPad there, so I'm guessing it's iPad.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.300]   Yes, it is indeed an iPad.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.300]   But you knew that before the invite went on.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.300]   Yes, that was called a scoop.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.300]   Do you actually have people inside Apple that will tell you things?
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.300]   Well, you know, Steve Jobs is always at my house for dinner.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.300]   No, no.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.300]   We have really good sources.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.300]   You say Steve, raise one eyebrow if you're going...
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   No, we have really good sources all through everywhere.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.300]   That's why we get so many good scoops on all things, too.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.300]   But we spend... we report.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.300]   We do reporting.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   That's how we get those scoops.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.300]   I know it's crazy, but...
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.300]   That's a wacky idea.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.300]   Is it... do you find it difficult to get information out of Apple?
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.300]   No, not that you know, it's like the Mount Everest of trying to get scoops, of course,
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.300]   which is challenging, but people have climbed Mount Everest.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300]   We've had a couple good scoops when they bought that ad network.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.300]   We had that one.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300]   And, you know, we've had a bunch of them.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   It's harder.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   It's definitely harder because the people there are more nervous to tell you things.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.300]   And justifiably, I suspect.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.300]   Yeah, because their job is on the line if they caught it.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.300]   Yeah, I think it caught.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.300]   But, you know, there's lots of ways to leak now, so that's...
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.300]   Thank you, Facebook.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   That's like that.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.300]   Not "Thank You, Julian Assange." Thank you, Fay.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.300]   Thank you, Mike Zuckerberg.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   I always say that Yahoo enjoys leaking through Gmail, which is always funny.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.300]   You were at Yahoo.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.300]   We're going to talk about what you found out from Yahoo, too, in just a little bit.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.300]   So iPad 2, do your sources tell you anything about what that iPad 2 might be?
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.300]   John Pichkowski has been doing a lot of reporting on it.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.300]   I think the camera is a certain kind of thing.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.300]   No.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   A camera in front or in back or both?
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.300]   I think it's going to be both.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.300]   I think it's going to be both.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   I don't see a camera in front.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.300]   You agree, Ome, a camera in back and in front?
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.300]   Sure, why not?
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.300]   I mean, I don't have a putting from me.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   Well, I mean, I could pretty much say for sure that they're going to have a front-facing
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.300]   camera because they're just trying to promote this ridiculous FaceTime thing.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.300]   Well, no, it's more for that.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.300]   But more for...
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.300]   It's actually better than iPad is probably better for that kind of thing.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.300]   Yeah, but I think there might be some question about whether you put a iPad 2,
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.300]   some question about whether you put a...
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.300]   Well, the Galaxy Tab has a real camera, but it's kind of weird to hold this big thing
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.300]   up and take a picture with it.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.300]   Well, it seems like it'll work a lot better for FaceTime.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.300]   So when I show off somebody else doing something, you're holding up the iPad.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.300]   You just switch cameras.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.300]   I mean, if the iPod Touch already has it, I don't see why the iPad 2 wouldn't.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.300]   That's a good point.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.300]   It just seems like it's just the natural evolution of this.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.300]   I think you're looking for work, for work that you use them at work as networking.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.300]   Oh, really?
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.300]   I mean, it's conferencing stuff.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.300]   Conferencing.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.300]   Yeah, I use GoToMeeting on the iPad.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.300]   It actually works pretty nicely.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.300]   I guess if it had a camera, but that would be the front facing more than the...
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   Yeah, but I think it's just why...
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.300]   Who uses FaceTime here?
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.300]   Not me.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.300]   I do.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.300]   I, as in on both do.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.300]   I don't...
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.300]   I only have Walt Mossberg on mine and I don't really want to face with him all the time.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.300]   [laughter]
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.300]   And that was an excellent FaceTimeer.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.300]   Oh, I'm sure.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.300]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.300]   Who do you FaceTime, I ask?
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.700]   My wife and my son, right now we have a really odd living thing because I sold my house and
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.620]   now I have to work in Manhattan, but they live somewhere else.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.300]   So I get to see them during the week, during FaceTime.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.740]   So it's kind of nice and the weird thing is that FaceTime seems to work better than Skype
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.740]   a lot for people.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.940]   Well, I was going to say, so you...
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.580]   Because that's what I would use Skype for.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.580]   Oh, Skype, if you...
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.380]   You know, I use Skype all the time to call family members, my daughter, and when she's
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.420]   out of the country or now and she's at college.
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.620]   But I use it on a laptop.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.460]   But you're saying you like it on the phone form factor.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.420]   Yeah, the weird thing is my kid, he's like eight months old.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.260]   He'll grab the actual phone or something.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.340]   He'll actually put it in front of his face.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.700]   So he's actually playing with the thing.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.420]   He actually sees me and he can hear me very well versus a laptop where he can end up closing
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.420]   windows really fast, like just tapping like a baby.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.780]   And the other thing is I use a MyFi instead of a regular phone.
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.420]   So I can use FaceTime really well, but Skype really is lousy on a MyFi, at least in New
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.420]   York it is.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.420]   So that's why I like FaceTime.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.540]   FaceTime still doesn't work on 3G.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.940]   You have to use Wi-Fi, right?
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.940]   Right.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.940]   Nothing changed when I was gone.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.940]   We would use FaceTime.
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.060]   Megan was just an F, my partner, Megan is just an Afghanistan and Skype didn't work
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.140]   and I would have loved to use FaceTime, but she works at Google and they're apparently
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.620]   not allowed to have them.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.620]   Really?
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.620]   There's a few.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.620]   I don't know.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.660]   No, she doesn't use, she used to use an iPhone and then suddenly it disappeared and that
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.660]   next--
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.660]   She has to do Android, huh?
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.660]   Yeah, apparently.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.100]   I like the Nexus S. I'm happy with it.
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.100]   It reboots randomly.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.100]   Has she noticed that?
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.380]   I don't think she would say it if she did.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.740]   Oh yeah, because she works at the G word.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.740]   She does use FaceTime.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.900]   That my friends, my family.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.900]   Really?
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.900]   Okay, so I stand corrected.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.980]   I thought it was-- I just thought I can't imagine anybody using this, but I guess somebody
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.980]   does.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.220]   At least two people on this panel.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.020]   Yeah, I asked, made a good point.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:18.660]   I think the Skype client leaves a lot to be desired on the phone.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.660]   So that gives Apple an opportunity.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:28.700]   Yeah, it's actually a very stable video chatting to, very stable.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.100]   What else will an iPad 2 have on?
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.380]   I have-- listen, I actually have no idea given that I was traveling and I really didn't
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.460]   have the story.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.460]   So I can't really comment.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:46.060]   My wish list for the iPad would be just more memory.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.060]   Think of--
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.060]   More story.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.060]   It's got 64 gigs.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.060]   That's a lot.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.060]   You want more than that?
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:56.100]   You know, I think that fills up really fast if you carry, let's say, a season of some
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:02.820]   TV show, and it slows down as you have a lot of stuff on the device.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.220]   So I would like-- more memory would be my number one.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.140]   Not more RAM, but more storage.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.140]   More storage.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.140]   More storage.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.420]   You know, a better network would be nice, but that's not going to happen in the US.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.300]   Then AT&T, don't you think there'll be a Verizon iPad?
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:28.340]   I hope so, but I really would like to see it on Sprint and T-Mobile as well because their
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.940]   networks are actually better right now because they're not--
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.740]   Because nobody's using them.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.820]   That's not quite true, but they actually have better networks for now.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.940]   So from a broadband perspective, so it'll be nice to have more options.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.940]   Cara, come on.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.940]   You know.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.940]   What else is it going to be?
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.940]   I don't know.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.940]   I haven't seen it.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.940]   You know, the idea-- whether it's going to have a different body.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.820]   It ain't going to have retina display because it would add to the battery--
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.820]   It would add to the battery.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.300]   I think it would be thinner.
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.300]   I think thinner and smaller.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.540]   And thinner and smaller and hipper.
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.900]   I think the Detroit model is what Apple's going on right now.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.300]   What they need to do is make the old iPad look old.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.300]   So what do you do?
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.300]   You add fins.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.300]   You do that with the iPhone.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.860]   I think it's going to be as dramatic a fix as the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3 was.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.340]   I suspect not.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.260]   And people do legitimately complain that the Kindle is so much easier to hold in bed when
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.260]   you're reading it.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260]   I think the iPad was thinner than mine.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.460]   You agree, I guess?
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.460]   Well, what I would like the device to do, apart from the style change, that's going
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.460]   to happen no matter what.
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.020]   So the old one looks outdated.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.860]   I'd like it to be-- like when you take it out of the box, I don't want to have to sink
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.860]   it anymore.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.340]   I just want to be able to just use it.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.340]   Dream on, dude.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.340]   That's Apple's model.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.340]   It's the one thing.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.820]   If I'm going to have a wish list, that's it.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:37.820]   Dream on.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.140]   That's the one thing Apple will never give up.
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.140]   Come on.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.820]   They want you to hook it up to the iTunes.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.820]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.980]   I mean, I can have iTunes right on the device, though.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.380]   I don't have to sink this thing up to do it.
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.980]   Maybe there's some crazy way they can activate it wirelessly.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.340]   Maybe if there were like this, somehow you could have a network that would go through
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.340]   the air and you didn't need wires and you could surf and wouldn't that be cool?
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.380]   So you're living in a future report.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.940]   I think there's going to be a lot of iterations of this iPad over time because now, finally
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.820]   there's competition eventually.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.820]   And so all these Android tablets are going to be different in lots of ways depending
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.380]   on which manufacturer is making them.
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.700]   So Apple's going to have to obviously up the feature.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.700]   Not just Android either.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.180]   You've got the RIM Playbook, which is very impressive.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.180]   It is.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.420]   We don't know what HP's going to do, but there's presumably a WebOS device coming out.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.420]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.380]   So I mean, I think that they're going to have to keep competing and adding.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.780]   I mean, obviously, they have John wrote a story last week that said, you know, of the
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.660]   4.5 million tablets sold, Apple made 4.3 million of them.
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:46.180]   So they have to differentiate themselves and continue to innovate, I guess.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.180]   Is it?
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.620]   I mean, it took how long to take for people to come up with iPhone competitors a couple
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.620]   of years at least.
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.620]   Yes.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.620]   It's going to happen faster this time.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.620]   Oh, definitely.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.780]   There were so many at, we called it TES, tablet entertainment show.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.420]   But what was interesting is you couldn't touch a lot of them because they were all in
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.420]   glass.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.340]   Well, I was, you know, everybody said the Zoom, the Motorola, and by the way, the Zoom is
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.340]   a terrible name.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.340]   Zoom, I guess.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.340]   Zoom.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.340]   Zoom.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.860]   Zoom is, but you couldn't touch it.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.940]   You know, it was running a video of Honeycomb.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.140]   So I was really kind of surprised that everybody said, oh, best of C.E.S.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.340]   Well, it was just a video player from what we saw.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.340]   You got to see the back rooms.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.340]   Did you get to go back?
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.340]   I didn't.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.340]   I didn't.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.340]   I know.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.340]   I've played with it since then.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.340]   And it actually works.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.340]   And it's nice.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.340]   And Honeycomb is great.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.340]   It's just that, you know, people who want to buy the iPad want to buy the iPad.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.940]   It's just the same thing with the iPhone.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.340]   Can someone succeed against the iPad?
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.540]   Is it possible to compete against the iPad?
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.540]   Yes.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.540]   Yes.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.540]   Of course, it is.
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.540]   It depends on what people want.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.140]   It's a streak at last year's D conference, which I said was like a giant waffle because
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.140]   they kept--
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.140]   It's too big.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.740]   Well, it was too big, too small for a tablet and too big for--
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.740]   Right.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.740]   It's five inches.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.140]   So I kept holding up my ear and calling it the waffle, which wasn't the guy.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.340]   I didn't like it too much when I did that.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.540]   But they, you know, they'll be different kinds.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.140]   There'll be tons and tons of different kinds.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.140]   And that's, you know, diversity is interesting to consumers, I think.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.740]   Is it an issue if Apple changes the screen resolution?
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.740]   I'm Apple.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.540]   One of the advantages Apple has is they only have two screen resolutions to support.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.340]   I guess they have three if you include the 3GS.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.420]   So maybe it isn't a disadvantage.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.740]   You know, I think the big thing about the tablet economy right now is that everybody
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.220]   else is playing Apple's game.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.260]   They're all trying to catch up with Apple.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:34.500]   So whatever Apple does this coming week will actually be a big leap forward compared to
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.860]   its rivals.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.700]   And it's not going to be little tiny features.
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.900]   It's going to be in the usability and the software, you know, in how it does things.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.620]   There will be new kind of software functionality built into it.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.500]   I am guessing that would be the key differentiation.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.340]   And that's how they're going to keep, you know, these other players guessing.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:03.300]   I mean, I've used a couple of these Android based tablets and, you know, I've used them.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.980]   I don't want to use them anymore.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:10.820]   I mean, just as they're nice, but they're not, you know, they're not a reason for me to
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.260]   not use an iPad.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.420]   So they're not that much better yet?
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.940]   No, they're not.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.900]   They're not even close to being better.
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:26.900]   I think the first one which had some semblance of, you know, an edge over the original iPad
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.660]   was the HP tablet.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.220]   And that's not going to be available for another few months.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.500]   I mean, what are these guys talking about competing with Apple?
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.500]   Half of them are not even on the market.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.620]   They're just two or three other tablets which are out there, at least in the US.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.260]   And, you know, they're as expensive as Apple.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.900]   So there is still a big advantage Apple has.
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:56.740]   And I think on the second of March, you're going to be surprised one more time in terms
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.260]   of like what they do with the experience of the iPad.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.660]   Is that Iowa's five?
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.660]   Who knows?
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.860]   Look, I have no idea.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.380]   So I'm not going to sit here and speculate.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.380]   Oh, why not?
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.380]   Come on, home.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.380]   Join the fun.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.140]   There's other people doing that.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.300]   You know, they do a better job of speculating.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.140]   Make some crap up.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.980]   I mean, if somebody else has to do something, you know, I'm kind of with you.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:23.980]   I'm kind of with you.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.980]   No, I'm kind of with you.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.580]   I think that that's, I think that, especially in the mainstream press, people act as if
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.100]   these rumors are a fact.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.100]   And no one knows what it's going to be.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   Well, I mean, what's interesting.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.100]   I just don't know what it's going to say.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.380]   No, well, I knew when it was and what it would be about.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.380]   We didn't report anything we didn't know.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.700]   Well, Scott, one, come on.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.700]   I have no idea.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.700]   I really don't.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.700]   He actually doesn't tell me.
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.700]   But what's interesting is that, you know, someone was just going by saying that they're
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:54.580]   going to be more honeycomb based, Google based, Android based tablets out than the iPad soon.
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:16:00.020]   I think the issue is even though Android has surpassed iPhone in terms of money, not in
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.180]   lease, not even slightly, I mean, these Android phones don't make money for all these individuals.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.180]   It's free.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.180]   Exactly.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.580]   So, I mean, they may surpass them in size.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.260]   It's just, you know, what we, what we lose in money, we make up in volume.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.260]   It's still have to be.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260]   Google makes money by people using Google stuff because of the advertising.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.260]   That's right.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.260]   That's what they're doing.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.820]   So this is not, I mean, they may surpass it in size and eventually they'll make more money
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.420]   from it, but it's not a money making opportunity for Google at this point.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.940]   I think it's the same logic we've had in the PC industry, right?
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:34.300]   You had Microsoft make a lot of money from their operating system and applications, whereas
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:40.740]   the PC guys have made little or marginal amount of money, the man of hardware manufacturers.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:46.020]   I think you're seeing exactly the same thing happening in the tablet and the smartphone.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.140]   You know, Google is going to do really well and I, you know, I'm happy for them because,
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:55.300]   you know, they've figured out a way to make money in a, in a platform which is very controlled.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:01.220]   And you know, I'm not so sure if other people actually, the hardware manufacturers actually
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.220]   do have a shot.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.540]   I think the guys who do have a shot are people like Samsung because they make memory and
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:13.220]   they make screens and they make processors and they make a whole bunch of other components.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.620]   And then now they got an OS which they can get from Google to put on their device so
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.780]   they can make some amount of money.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:25.820]   So, you know, I don't think we should, like, there is a lot of confusion which goes on
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.540]   because Apple does the OS and the hardware.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.420]   So we confuse that and then we have Google which does the OS.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:40.500]   So I think if Google OS in the smartphone and the tablet is going to be a spectacular
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.140]   winner because it's going to boost Google services.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.740]   I think it's not about Google making dollars and cents in from the actual OS, but they
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:56.540]   are making money from various services they sell whether it's Gmail, advertising, whatever.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:02.220]   Yeah, and the things we've seen at Google when they have their app market on actual tablets
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.700]   and when they have it on phones, those phones and those tablets do a lot better.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.700]   So I mean, Google does have a small interest in their OS doing well because once you've
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.700]   seen Android and all these, you know, terribly cheap tablets, like I just saw one like on
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.740]   QVC, the next book, you know, this terrible Android tablet.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:24.380]   But it didn't have the Google app market and it's when they have their app market, they're
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.300]   going to get, you know, a nice little cut of money there too.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.860]   I mean, they also have their subscription service.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.860]   So they're going to win any which way because the more things that have Google on there,
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   the better they're going to do.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.180]   And the other thing is with Honeycomb, they really went out there and tried some things
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.500]   that aren't like the iPad.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.500]   It looks very different.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.740]   It looks like you can actually use it as a computer if you really wanted to, which is,
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.380]   I know this is one tablets are supposed to be, but it's actually very interesting to
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.460]   me to see what Google has done with Honeycomb.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:54.260]   It's actually very windows like the Honeycomb is very windows like how you actually navigate
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:19:02.140]   and, you know, the look, I like the Honeycomb, but not so sure the new tablets are very
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.980]   impressive just yet.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.980]   Right.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.980]   I think it's going to take a while before.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.540]   I mean, like, I remember when, when Android was first introduced, it was supposed to be
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:14.060]   Google's giant iOS competitor and it was really just kind of lackluster.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.460]   And since this is their first version of their own tablet, OS with the Honeycomb, I figured
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.180]   by the, maybe by next year, they'll have it completely down.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.820]   I mean, they seem to take their time, but they eventually get it right.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.180]   Oh, you just wrote an article I thought very interesting about the FTC looking at apples
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.860]   in app purchases by kids.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.260]   Both I as and Kara have little kids and, but it's the last thing you want to do is give
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:42.820]   a little kid iPhone or an iPad, especially if you're running one of those fishing programs
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.780]   or the farming programs, because it's not so hard for them to buy stuff and spend a
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.260]   lot of money with that your knowledge.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.740]   We just got Katie Perry's California girls video, unfortunately.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.580]   There was a reason for that.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.300]   He said it's nine and he became interested in.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.460]   He says that carrot Katie, there's something about her.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.180]   I just like called the whipped cream situation.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.940]   Something going on.
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.740]   I was quite pleased with that.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.980]   So I'm glad the FTC is investigating it.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.380]   How serious are they?
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:17.300]   Who knows, you know, FTC or the Washington, DC, these days is pretty hard to read, right?
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.780]   They say they're investigating a lot of things.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:20.940]   Nothing really comes out of it.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.940]   So who knows?
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.940]   Exactly.
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.420]   I mean, this is, this is, you know, a very strange Washington, DC.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.500]   There's a lot of talk, not much action.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.460]   So we don't know.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.620]   That's the best way to go elected.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.260]   Say the right, say the things that your constituency wants to hear, but whatever you do, don't
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.260]   do anything.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.260]   Okay.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.740]   Well, I think I'll keep that in mind.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.060]   Should I decide to run for all the public office?
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.460]   They seem to have done a lot of looking at things and they never acted in act on ad
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.460]   mob.
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.980]   They didn't act on Facebook and the privacy things.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.260]   They keep investigating the, the ITA with Google might be the first move.
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.100]   And I think they did stop one thing where they asked.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:04.420]   Well, but there's a chilling effect because I think Apple, for instance, approved Google
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:09.500]   voice one year later, one year after the fact because of scrutiny from the, you know, the
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.780]   ad mob went through because of Apple's actions right before it with their things.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.660]   So there's some, it just, there's some scrutiny, but there's no action.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.540]   There's no, there's, there hasn't been a, I think the ITA one might be if Google decides
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.540]   to fight.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.540]   What is the ITA?
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.860]   The software, the software, flight information software companies that Google bought.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.860]   Oh, that's the Google bought that.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.860]   I see software.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.860]   Yeah, that travel.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.220]   And a lot of, there's, they've got an array of opponents to it.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.180]   And I, that should be an interesting signal.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.580]   Mostly the array of opponents is Google's competition.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.580]   Absolutely.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.580]   But of course it will be.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.380]   But you know, there's some air, no airlines, not just Microsoft.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.340]   I know Google says it all the time, but there's legitimate people nervous about Google having
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.420]   all this slight information, including myself.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.580]   I mean, it's just, it's, they have a, that's a very powerful company they bought in the,
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.740]   in the, in the, what is your fear that Google will somehow know that you're going to Barcelona
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.100]   and show you ads for Barcelona.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.100]   Not today.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.100]   They're not tracking me.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.100]   But no, I think that they, that they have, they have a lock on a lot of critical information.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.380]   So if you, if you're a travel, if you have a travel company for having Google owning
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.940]   the travel information, it could, it could, lots of things could happen.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.260]   I'm not a antitrust lawyer, but you know.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:21.180]   Well, I think it's the big issue is that it impacts the business of people like.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.180]   It's just eating your dog.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:29.220]   Hayak and Orbits and other, other players who buy their data from ITA software.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.460]   I can't really fault Google for doing an end run around these guys and buying the company,
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.020]   which is selling all these third parties data.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.900]   I mean, that's what, you know, if you have the money, you want to spend it, right?
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:48.500]   I think what the government needs to do is ensure that it doesn't get control of the
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.540]   data and just, you know, basically locks out competition.
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.940]   I think that is not what should happen.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.340]   And they should be allowed to own this company, but they should, they should be an oversight
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.300]   and access to information to third parties.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.740]   But the other thing is Expedia actually has their own software service for their own travel
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.540]   information and there's a number of competitors out there.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.620]   So Google even bought this.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.860]   I think this is actually a great opportunity for someone like Expedia to partner with like
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.540]   Facebook or something like that where you see these results showing up there.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.660]   I mean, just because Google owns ITA or they end up owning ITA, it would seem like it'd
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.580]   be in their best interest to license that software to make as much money as they can.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.780]   Because what, I mean, they just lock it down.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:32.060]   It doesn't seem like it would make any financial sense to do that.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.620]   We're going to take a little bit of a break here.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.580]   When we come back, you know, there's something going on tonight.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.060]   We started a little early this, this afternoon.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.180]   A guy here, there's like a TV show everybody wants to watch tonight.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.580]   That's why I'm wearing my glasses.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.580]   Yeah, you're very cool.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.580]   You got that Hollywood look.
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.580]   Are you ready for the red carpet?
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.260]   I feel like, you know, I want to thank my parents and my children.
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:56.940]   We're going to talk to the producer of one of the Oscar nominated films in just a little
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.940]   bit.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:58.940]   Wish him luck as he heads off.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.300]   He's probably headed for the, no, he's about to go to the red carpet and we've actually
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.780]   in a limo, an actual large car.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.820]   But before we do that, I want to take a break for an ad.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:09.820]   That just shows you how nonchalant.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.820]   I liked it.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.820]   I was smooth.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.420]   How casual, how revenue focused I am.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.420]   Excellent.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.580]   I want to.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.220]   I want to mention our friends have got a meeting.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.900]   Citrix does such great stuff and they've got a great meeting program.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:27.220]   We were just talking about how a front facing camera on the iPad would be so great for go
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.220]   to meeting.
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.660]   Go to meeting is free on the iPad.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.260]   It's a fantastic tool.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.500]   I was at a meeting in the backyard out here.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.500]   I just sat on the bench.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.740]   I had Wi-Fi and because it's got a microphone and a speaker, I was in the meeting.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.900]   If I had a camera, man, that would be even better.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.300]   Go to meeting for product reviews, for sales presentations, training selections, sessions,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:51.740]   the collaboration, all right from your desk, Windows, Mac, and yes iPad.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.660]   If you want to try it free for 30 days, just go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.980]   G-O-T-O, meeting.com/twit and give it a try.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.300]   Why do all those long, boring conference calls or all that extra travel when you can have
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.580]   a go to meeting instead?
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.580]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.820]   Let me dial Dana Brunetti up here.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.820]   Let's see.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.700]   He's going to be on number three.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:21.580]   Because Dana is the producer of the social network and he's with Trigger Street and we're
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.580]   here.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.340]   Kevin Spacey, hey Dana, how are you?
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.420]   Hey, I'm good, man.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.460]   I'm trying to turn down the audio.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.740]   You look so sharp in that tuxedo.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.740]   Almost a second.
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:32.740]   I got you on the audio.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.060]   I got a sloppy stream and there you are.
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.060]   That's it.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.060]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.060]   Let me pull them up here.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.060]   This is awesome.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.500]   Well, congratulations on the nomination for Best Picture.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.500]   Thanks.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.860]   Actually, you have a number of nominations.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.380]   I know Best Adapted Screenplay as well.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:54.700]   Yeah, we have Adapted Screenplay Score, Editing and Director and a bunch of others that I'm
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.700]   forgetting.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.700]   I'm too nervous to even.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.700]   Actor.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.700]   Is it?
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.700]   Let's not forget that.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.060]   Dusty Isenberg is nominated for Best Actor.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.060]   Sound and cinematography.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.100]   We have eight in total.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.900]   Oh, you must feel pretty good about that.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.900]   It's really like I got to fix my bow tie here.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.580]   So do you get to sit up front with the big shots?
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.820]   Yeah, I mean, I mean row F, C, 17.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.820]   Whoa.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.260]   So we're going to look for you on the broadcast.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.260]   Center.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.260]   Whoa.
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.860]   Who are you bringing?
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.860]   My lovely girlfriend.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.860]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.860]   She's upstairs.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.900]   Her name is Scarlett Johansson.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.580]   No, just teasing.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.820]   No, it's not.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:44.820]   I just got you in trouble.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.820]   I'm sorry, dude.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:46.820]   I didn't mean it.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.820]   She's not.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.820]   I apologize.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.820]   No, that's awesome, Dana.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.820]   We wish you the best.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.820]   And I think you're going to win.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.820]   What do you think?
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.820]   What do you think?
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:55.820]   Do you have your speech prepared?
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.820]   I mean, how much?
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.820]   I do speech prepared.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.260]   You know, at the last time I had a speech prepared is when we are losing streets started.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.420]   I'm like, you know what?
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.420]   It's true.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.060]   I'm not doing it this time.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.860]   I'm hoping for the best, but prepared for the worst because everyone thinks it's going
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.940]   to be the king speech.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:19.060]   But the fact of the matter is it's a horse race and that there's even the possibility
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.860]   that I could be on that stage is that's just gratifying enough.
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:27.300]   But in a weird way, I kind of expect that there was no chance just I could go and kind
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.580]   of enjoy it.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.740]   And I actually really appreciate you having me off because I was tweeting everything.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.900]   That's why you guys were going on.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.580]   And I'm like, this would be awesome just to go on and do this.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.580]   Awesome.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.580]   Are you kidding?
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.780]   Well, for me, it keeps my mind off of what I'm about to go and do.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.780]   Well, okay.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.780]   Here's the most important question.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.500]   Will you tweet from the Kodak Theater?
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.580]   Yeah, I'm going to tweet from, you know, from when I get off of here, I'll tweet.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.580]   I've already tweeted that.
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.300]   I was getting ready to do this.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.340]   And then I'll tweet from the car, the red carpet as much as they let me.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.540]   They don't allow cameras, but I do everything from my iPhone.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.220]   I use that panel 360 app.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.580]   I'll try to do one for you.
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.580]   I'd love a panel 360.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.980]   Yeah, I'll try to do one within the theater.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:16.620]   If they'll allow me, if I don't get thrown out before the awards start.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:23.140]   Let me just give you a tip because, you know, as somebody who flaunted the regulations of
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:29.340]   Apple and streamed Steve Jobs' iPad announcement, and of course, has never been invited back
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.300]   again, just go ahead and do it.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.460]   Also, did you invite Zuckerberg to go with you?
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.460]   You know what?
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:40.180]   If Zuckerberg wanted to, and I'm sure my girlfriend would kill me, I would take him.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.060]   You know, I tried to get him to go to the premiere, and he didn't seem very excited.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.260]   He did see it eventually, though.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.260]   He did.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.780]   He went with the group, but I actually tried to get him to do it to just like ruin your
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.500]   premiere and good for me.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.260]   That wouldn't ruin my premiere at all.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.820]   I know it would have been good for everybody, but he didn't seem interested.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.820]   So I tried.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.980]   I told him to go.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.140]   I ran into his sister on the red carpet at the Golden Globe.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.140]   Right.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:07.060]   So, as we walked out onto the red carpet, she was right ahead of us, and they announced
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.180]   who it is, so they know who they're shooting photos of.
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.820]   And they said, "Dana, Bernetti, producer of the social network."
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.300]   And I saw this like little rustling ahead of us, and it turned out she turned around
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.300]   and came back to me and introduced herself.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.300]   And we actually had our picture taken together.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.300]   It was pretty cool.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.780]   Yeah, she's pregnant also, which is interesting.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.780]   Yeah.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.780]   She's super friendly.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.780]   She's incredibly social.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.780]   Randy Zuckerberg.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.780]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.500]   She's very social, and has a lot of personality and a terrific woman.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.060]   You know, Dana, if I were Mark Zuckerberg at this point, I know I'd say that I'd say
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.060]   that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.060]   say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that

[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:37.060]   I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:40:07.060]   I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:37.060]   I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say that I'd say
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:47.060]   Is this true? Are they still giving away birthday cakes? Are they? All right, every... I see tweets from our listeners
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:53.060]   say, "I got a birthday cake!" Every day, FreshBooks is giving away a birthday cake to one of our audience members
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:57.060]   and it doesn't have to be your birthday. There's nothing better. Is it than getting a birthday cake
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:03.060]   and it's not your birthday? It's like just free money. So they draw a name every day for the entire month.
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:13.060]   It's kind of fun. All right, back we go to the news.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.060]   Do you care? Do you recuse yourself on Google Stories or do you...?
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:21.060]   No, I have a big disclosure. Not all of them. You know, Peter does all the advertising ones and...
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:24.060]   Since your partner works at Google. I don't do anything that she works on.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.060]   But she doesn't tell... She doesn't come home and tell me.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.060]   You don't tell me anything. It's very clear. We have a lard. You go and read it. I'll bore you into submission.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.060]   We have a long disclosure that she doesn't tell me anything. And if she does, I would put it in the story.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   I've only recused myself once from a story that she didn't tell me she was working on and I found out through another source.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.060]   So later you said, "Oops." I had to stop writing about it.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:50.060]   So this has been an issue for a while with Google as these content farms.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.060]   Yes. And Google's always said, "You know, that's illegal or whatever it is."
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.060]   But now they've declared war.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:01.060]   What does that mean? Is it worse than what it was before?
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:05.060]   Google's always changed its algorithm. So I think they're making a big deal of it.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.060]   They're making a big public deal of it versus it.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.060]   When are they going to clear war on on-demand media?
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:15.060]   Well, they aren't. They haven't. They didn't. What was interesting was that, you know, some of the content on demand is good.
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:19.060]   Some of it's not. I mean, it's like all these other sites, Mahalo, or Associated Content.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:23.060]   What was interesting is some of these surveys showed that Associated Content, which Yahoo! owns, got hit badly.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.060]   I'd be curious to know how Blogger got hit. That's a Google property.
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:34.060]   You know, they didn't talk about that. So it was a question of whether, and also what standards of quality is Google imposing here.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.060]   Like who decides from all of them?
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.060]   This is that kind of authority issue, isn't it?
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.060]   How does a search engine judge authority or quality?
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.060]   Right, exactly. And I think that'll be interesting.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.060]   But I mean, I think what's most interesting, and I talked to Yahoo! this afternoon about it.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:51.060]   Luke Beatty, who created Associated Content, which was bought by Yahoo! about a year ago.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:58.060]   I think what he was, his argument was that we don't rely on search very much for as much as we used to anyway.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:05.060]   We rely on social increasingly Facebook, and we rely a lot on the distribution on the Yahoo! owned and operated networks.
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.060]   But so search has become less important. That's his--
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.060]   I think that's true for everyone.
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.060]   Yeah, so he said--
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.060]   I think that is so not true for all these guys. I think they just have made me guess.
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.060]   They were right.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.060]   I mean, I think you'll go ahead.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:22.060]   Go ahead. Go ahead. No. What I was saying is, like most of these guys, I think there's two things to it.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:29.060]   I think Google needs these content forms as much as they need Google.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:34.060]   They make a lot of money from each other, both the companies, whether it's demand media or whosoever.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:39.060]   It is they are big proponents of the Google advertising system.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.060]   So Google is clearly benefiting from that.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:47.060]   If it really hates them, it should stop doing all business with them.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.060]   I think that's the key thing.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:59.060]   This is somewhat like the old days of the PC when you used to have to buy a bigger PC because Microsoft would release a new software upgrade,
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.060]   and because it would need more horsepower.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.060]   I think it's the same kind of thing.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:14.060]   It's like more of these guys are actually doing things to use up whatever Google is offering as an opportunity to make money.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:20.060]   And then they use, on the other hand, Google's advertising systems to make money.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:26.060]   So I think there is a bit of the-- it doesn't make-- it's not all that clear to me.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.060]   I think there is something-- this is more of a PR exercise.
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:35.060]   And I think-- well, they say a major change in our algorithm.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.060]   They've got some other issues going on at Google.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.060]   So they've been a lot of complaints about the quality, what's of all their face.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.060]   They say this will impact 11.8% of all Google queries.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:50.060]   Google's facing really major challenges from Facebook and social networks in terms of search.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.060]   Social is important.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.060]   Absolutely, no question.
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.060]   I think it is.
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.060]   I think they're very--
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.060]   Google's acknowledging it.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.060]   They're putting social search to the front center.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.060]   Absolutely.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.060]   They still don't have a social solution.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:07.060]   I mean, a piece that I haven't written yet, the lead is social to Google as searches to Microsoft.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.060]   Oh, I like it.
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.060]   Thank you.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.060]   I like it.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:15.060]   I think it's a big issue for them to make a big issue of it.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.060]   Right.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.060]   But it's more PR-Om than it is substance?
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.060]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:28.060]   I mean, you know, why would-- you know, one-- all one has to do is start looking into the financials of demand
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:33.060]   and see where their revenues are coming from, how much business they do with Google.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.060]   And you know, and you start to-- it all starts to make sense.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.060]   I mean--
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.060]   But wait a minute.
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.060]   But that's a short-term point of view from--
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.060]   No, let me finish.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.060]   I think what you're looking at is the guys at AOL are trying to do the same thing.
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:52.060]   You say, well, we're going to set up our own content form so that we can make more money.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.060]   I mean, the whole world wants to go that way.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:46:02.060]   They want to go that way because there is clearly a clean and easy way to monetize that, you know,
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.060]   crummy traffic, so to speak, right?
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.060]   And that is Google itself.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:12.060]   If Google actually gets rid of these content farms and they're still serving ads on the sites that still survive
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:17.060]   this, I guess, removal, can they charge more money for the ads they're serving on those sites?
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.060]   Will that make any financial sense?
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:24.060]   I'm just trying to wrap my head around exactly how they're making money from all this stuff.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.060]   Here is how they make money, okay?
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:32.060]   The more content farms are out there on the web, there is more content on the web.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:38.060]   The longer it takes you and I to find things, the longer it takes you and I to find things,
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.060]   the more they can serve up ads.
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:45.060]   But in the long run, the longer it takes us for us to find things, the less likely we already use Google.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.060]   Exactly.
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:53.060]   So what they have to do is optimize their business around the idea that, oh, okay, we are going to just
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:57.060]   make it usable, just usable enough.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:01.060]   So using longer but just not long enough to bother us.
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.060]   That's cynical as hell.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:08.060]   So just good enough to work so that, I don't know, I really think that's because their surf results have been
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.060]   like nonsense and they had that little stupid preview now.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.060]   So you don't have to look at the content farms.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.060]   I know I've been irritated by the results.
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:20.060]   I've actually used Bingmore lately because I just couldn't, I just wasn't getting the money stuff.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.060]   So what's that?
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:26.060]   Can Google get away with this because there isn't a credible alternative?
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.060]   Yeah, sure.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.060]   That gives them more.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.060]   Can we can?
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.060]   Yeah, they can push it harder.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:36.060]   Yeah, I mean, I think the issues is they've got to, that they need stuff in, as Ohm said, they need stuff to
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.060]   search.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:41.060]   I mean, and one of the problems is Google is this giant Borg that's been needing information for years,
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:46.060]   including from the Wall Street Journal, from where I work, where everywhere else, and they've run smag and stuff.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.060]   Now you're doing the Rupert Murdoch.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.060]   No, no, no, no, no, no, they've done it.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.060]   Google hurts my vision.
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:56.060]   I'm not saying that's, thank you for that lovely impression of Rupert Murdoch.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.060]   I don't know what that's like.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:05.060]   They've run into a piece, Facebook is a planet that won't let it eat them or near them or get near them.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:09.060]   And so what's interesting is that I had a conversation with the Google's I could have, and they're like,
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.060]   Facebook should be open because, you know, it'd be better for people if Google could search it.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.060]   I said, it's good for Google.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.060]   It's not good for anybody else, necessarily.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.060]   Interesting.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:24.060]   They've run into massive amounts of content they can't eat, and it's a really interesting problem for them.
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.060]   It is like the Borg, where they came to a planet that they couldn't assume.
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.060]   Yes, exactly.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.060]   And Facebook's not letting the men trust me.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.060]   I mean, they've said it very clearly and explicitly that they're not letting it.
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:38.060]   Does anyone else, is anyone else happy actually about this idea if the content farms go away, at least our material isn't being ripped off?
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:42.060]   I know when I would search for my own stuff, I'd be now and then because I wanted to remember where the story was.
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.060]   I would see content farms show up before my own work.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.060]   Oh, I hate that.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.060]   I hate that.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:54.060]   Does anyone actually, as a user of Google, anyone else is actually happy about the idea of finding your own work on your own site for once?
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.060]   Yeah, I think some of the stuff is going to go up higher.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.060]   Some of it is going to go lower.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.060]   I think that's what someone from Yahoo.
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.060]   I think they're right.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:04.060]   I think it just will depend on how Google tweaks these results.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:15.060]   According to Google, this update is designed to reduce rankings for low quality sites, sites which are low value add for users, copy content from other websites like IAS, or sites that are not available.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.060]   Or sites that are just not very useful.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.060]   This is on Meet, Singal, and Matt Cutts talking about blog posts to meet.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.060]   Yes, as is Matt.
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.060]   Nice people.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:27.060]   At the same time, it will provide better rankings for high quality sites, sites with original content.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.060]   But isn't that what Google needs to do and wants to do?
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.060]   What's wrong with that?
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.060]   They do.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.060]   They do.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.060]   They've just made it.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.060]   I think the point is they're making a big deal of it.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.060]   This is something they should be doing every single day.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:42.060]   It's sort of like saying, "Today, the Wall Street Journal is creating factual content that we're serving up to our readers.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.060]   It's factualer than ever."
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.060]   The price we will actually have...
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.060]   There's 3% more factual...
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.060]   More stories.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.060]   More true stories.
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:52.060]   I don't know who this "cystrix" is.
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.060]   This is an SEO blog.
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.060]   So cystrix...
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.060]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.060]   They have a Visibility Index.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:04.060]   An index value calculated from traffic on keywords ranking and click-through rate on specific positions.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:11.060]   They claim, based on a dataset of 1 million keywords checked before the update and yesterday, these are the 25 biggest losers.
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.060]   Why is he...
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.060]   He's disputing this by the way.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.060]   He's using articles, sweet 101, Hub pages, buzzel.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.060]   Hub pages, buzzel.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.060]   Associated content, number 6.
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   Yeah, I know.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.060]   Yahoo is...
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.060]   I will be having...
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.060]   That's the Yahoo site.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.060]   I have an interview with Luke Beatty where he disputes the...
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.060]   He says, "You can't know within a 24-hour period."
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.060]   He said, "We'll know within weeks."
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:32.060]   He suspects a downgrade, for sure, on many sites.
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.060]   He expects an upgrade on some, but he doesn't...
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.060]   He said, "You can't...
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.060]   Love to know.com mahalos on here.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.060]   Business.com.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.060]   Do it yourself.com.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:42.060]   Some stuff is good on it.
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.060]   Well, some stuff on buzzel is excellent too, actually.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.060]   That's the issue.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.060]   I think these are just...
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.060]   FAQs.org.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.060]   That's a good...
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.060]   Yeah, this is...
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.060]   This is...
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.060]   Examinar.com.
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.060]   Is that the San Francisco?
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.060]   No.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.060]   Allbusiness.com.
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.060]   That's not a bad site.
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.060]   Well, anyway.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:07.060]   I think the bigger issue which Kara was actually bringing up is that a lot of these sites actually do make decent content.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.060]   Like, not all of them, but some of them do.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:20.060]   And I think Google needs to figure out how to deal with those people as much as it needs to figure out how to deal with the nefarious people in there.
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.060]   Shouldn't it be just page by page?
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.060]   Why site by site?
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.060]   I think that's...
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:25.060]   I think that's...
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.060]   You know, there is...
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:32.060]   Look, there is a lot of the stuff which is going on there is actually on a page to page basis also.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.060]   There's a...
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:36.060]   Look, this is where people are just like people.
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:40.060]   We're always writing viruses for the Microsoft OS.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.060]   It's the same thing.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:47.060]   People are writing a hacks for the Google search OS essentially.
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.060]   I think that's exactly the parallel right now.
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.060]   You know, this will be a battle which will continue.
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.060]   And I...
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:58.060]   You know, they need to kind of make sure that they don't throw out the baby with the bath water.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:02.060]   And, you know, there is one thing I would say about Google.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:11.060]   Of all the companies, you know, of their side of that magnitude, they are one of the companies which actually tries to do the right thing.
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.060]   Okay?
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.060]   I may be cynical about them.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.060]   I may be very critical about them.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:24.060]   I do want to make sure that I pointed out that they are actually at the very core as a company, they believe in doing the right thing.
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:31.060]   Now, as they hire more and more people away from companies like Microsoft, you're going to see their, you know, their corporate behavior.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.060]   Go down the drain.
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:40.060]   But as a company, as of now, I think Carrick and a test to that, given that she has been writing about them forever.
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:46.060]   And I would say the same, they have always tried to do the right thing.
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:51.060]   You know, it doesn't sometimes work out the way you and I would like it to work out.
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:55.060]   But, you know, I would give them full credit for trying it, please.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.060]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.060]   I think they're, you know, it's not, you know, I think they...
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.060]   I think you're absolutely right. I agree with you completely.
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:08.060]   I do think they're facing a lot of pressure from social networks and you're beginning to see that they need to compete better.
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.060]   And they have to make it more obvious that they're competing.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:14.060]   They don't just get to operate and be fabulous 100 percent and make all this money.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.060]   They have to face these issues and talk about them.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.060]   So that's a good sign for them to do that.
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:23.060]   Do you think, though, that real people ever even see any of this or notice any of this?
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.060]   Yes, they do. I think when you get crappy results, you do do.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.060]   Yeah, that's what you notice.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.060]   Yes.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.060]   Yes.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.060]   That's all good. I mean, the PR thing is all for us.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.060]   Yes.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:34.060]   But all real people care about is it working for me?
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.060]   Good results. Good results.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.060]   And they're reinforcing that they're interested in good results.
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:39.060]   Yeah, which they should be.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:40.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:46.060]   You say that Matt Cutz assertions about Microsoft being lifting Google search results are loopy.
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.060]   Oh, I did.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.060]   [laughter]
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:51.060]   I think that was kind of a strange, you know, they're being...
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.060]   And it looks like, your point now, that Cutz is being kind of groomed as like the superstar.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.060]   No, I printed some emails from Washington. He's been appearing in Senate committees.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.060]   He's been appearing before the antitrust Institute.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.060]   He's the face man for Google.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.060]   Well, that's a nice guy.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.060]   He's a nice guy.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.060]   But he's like...
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.060]   He calls himself the web ambassador or something like that.
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.060]   That's interesting.
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.060]   He's got the title like that. But I like Matt a lot.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:15.060]   But he's definitely been super aggressive in, you know, in that whole Microsoft thing,
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.060]   which I think Google did not look terrific in.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:20.060]   I don't know. I don't know what Omar is thinks, but I thought...
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:22.060]   I didn't think they looked very good at all on that particular fight.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:31.060]   I think there is the bigger story, which I almost wrote and I didn't, was how corporate, you know,
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:36.060]   leaders and corporations are using Twitter to misbehave.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:39.060]   You know, what was this guy from Google?
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.060]   Vic Mendoza.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.060]   I mean, how is that the right thing to do?
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:45.060]   What is Vic misbehave?
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.060]   What?
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.060]   No, he put a tweet up that said a Turkey and Eagle doesn't make a...
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.060]   When the Nokia of Microsoft...
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:56.060]   It was juvenile, but Vic is very well known for making a string of stupid jokes.
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:03.060]   But Cara, how is that the right thing to do for a company whose corporate motto is "Do no evil."
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:06.060]   That is doing evil to its competitors because it's...
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.060]   What? Making fun of a Microsoft Nokia merger?
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.060]   Who did it before the merger, before it was announced?
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:13.060]   And they had an NDA on that.
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.060]   Oh, so he broke an NDA to make that tweet.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:23.060]   I just... I can't believe, you know, Larry and Sergey and Eric would let him get away with that.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:26.060]   That is a crummy move, in my opinion.
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:29.060]   I think that is misbehave, corporate misbehave.
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:33.060]   No, I wrote a piece saying I thought this was what life was like under Larry.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.060]   This is to me vintage Larry, actually.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:36.060]   Aggressive.
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.060]   Very aggressive.
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.060]   Very aggressive.
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:41.060]   He makes a lot of remarks, including internally at Google.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.060]   He's very snarky.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.060]   He can be very snarky in his comments.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:48.060]   And I think what Victor did was something that might not have happened under Eric.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:52.060]   Eric's still the CEO, but, you know, I thought it was a very juvenile.
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.060]   I don't know if it was evil.
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:56.060]   I thought it was juvenile and obnoxious.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:01.060]   And then it was followed by another Google executive who did the same thing, another engineer.
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:02.060]   And it was sort of sour grapes.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:06.060]   And then Eric, of course, did say, of course we wanted the deal publicly later.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.060]   He was a little more gracious about the situation.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.060]   There's been other companies which have done the same thing.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.060]   So it's not like just Google.
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:19.060]   But it's just like how people are using Twitter to just kind of just let it all out.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:25.060]   It's public, you know, publicly, you know, publicly they're airing their private laundry,
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.060]   so to speak.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:27.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.060]   It was sour grapes.
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.060]   Very sour grapes and very unattractive to swatch.
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:34.060]   Google's always kind of had this kind of unfortunate.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:37.060]   Well, even Eric Schmidt hasn't been always very traditional.
[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.060]   He's sort of a law of the dumb remarks.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.060]   He got, we have a picture of him with a ball in his mouth.
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.060]   Can I be honest?
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.060]   I kind of prefer that.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:47.060]   I'd rather see a company that isn't quite so calculated and polished.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:53.060]   And then you kind of, I mean, you hope you might see some evidence of what's going on behind
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.060]   the scenes.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.060]   This was one time, I remember, I don't know if Omi or at this, it was an event for Android
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:02.060]   and they were, Vic made one remark about Steve Jobs, another one about Apple and then he made
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:03.060]   eight more.
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.060]   Yeah, that was I.O.
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.060]   Google I.O.
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.060]   Yeah, last year was very snotty.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.060]   Are you 12?
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.060]   Like one show of the online.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.060]   I think we're going to create this little strange.
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.060]   I like it.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.060]   You like it.
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.060]   I like it.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.060]   I think it's genuine.
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.060]   What doesn't matter?
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.060]   These are engineers.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.060]   They're not comedians.
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.060]   It's not Steve Martin up there.
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:22.060]   I think the point is if you have an NDA with the company.
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:23.060]   Well, that's different.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:24.060]   I agree with you on that.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:27.060]   And then you go out and make remarks like that.
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.060]   How would anyone should take you seriously?
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:32.060]   I don't think we'll ever get another NDA.
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:35.060]   I mean, that's the point.
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:40.040]   Like, I mean, you know, it reminds me of the old days of Microsoft when Microsoft was cut
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   throat and would say things like that.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.040]   What did I say?
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.780]   There's a Microsoft influence at work at Google.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:47.940]   Google is becoming the new Microsoft.
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.540]   I think we need more than Silicon.
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.540]   The new old Microsoft.
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:51.700]   Let's get some the pirates.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:52.700]   The new Microsoft.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.140]   Yeah, the new old, the old new, the new whatever.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.140]   Whatever.
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:57.140]   What that?
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.780]   By the way, Dana Brunetti is now left for the Oscars.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.060]   We have this just in from Twitter.
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:03.060]   Whoa.
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.060]   He looks good in red, doesn't he?
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.060]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:06.060]   That's not him.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.060]   That's the tuxedo guy.
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.060]   That's Miz.
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:09.060]   That's Miz.
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.060]   Isn't that, that's great.
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.060]   That's jargon.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.060]   Red is a good color.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.060]   And she's proposing the way you're supposed to in us.
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.060]   That's the up.
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:16.060]   The hip out.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.660]   But can I say something?
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.180]   Red is a good color except for on the red carpet.
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:21.180]   You don't want to clash.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.180]   Oh, red's always a good color.
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.140]   Oh, you think even on a red carpet?
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:25.740]   I used to cover a lot of those events.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.740]   Did you really?
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.740]   Yep, for the Washington Post.
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:28.740]   Were you like you were a feature reporter?
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:29.740]   It was a celebrity.
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:30.740]   I was a feature reporter in the style.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.540]   I did parties for the Washington Post.
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:33.540]   Style, huh?
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:38.660]   I don't have very much of it, but I did cover it.
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:41.540]   Anything I'm sorry, I turned you down because the phone was ringing.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:42.780]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.140]   I'm not at my own home.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:45.300]   So this is a problem.
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.300]   But I did want to mention this.
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.220]   I mean, it hasn't everybody, like from Apple to Microsoft, always poked fun at everybody
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:51.220]   at every event.
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:54.260]   I mean, for Google to do it, I mean, they can also get away with it.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.260]   Because what are you going to do?
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.100]   Are you going to mess with Google with Google?
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.900]   Because they can just make you kind of disappear from search results.
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:01.220]   They better not start doing that.
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:04.100]   Because that's then I might go, that's evil.
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.100]   They can.
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.100]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.100]   A lot of people think that they turn it away.
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:09.700]   I RS, I think we got a problem.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:10.700]   They can do what they want.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:11.700]   I mean, they're a private company, right?
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.260]   The thing is, eventually somebody's going to make a misstep, even if it's...
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.260]   They're not.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.260]   They're a public company.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.260]   I'm saying they can't...
[00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:21.540]   No, I mean, they're not like a government agency, what I mean by that.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:25.180]   They can go out there and do stupid things left and right.
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:29.780]   Just the question is, since they're the de facto standard in search, they can get away with
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:30.780]   it.
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:33.820]   The care might be their stock, their stake owners.
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:37.100]   They may not be too happy about that.
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.140]   I just don't know if normal people are going to notice this.
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.140]   The other thing.
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.140]   I agree with you, I...
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:45.700]   That's kind of the point I was making, which is this is totally inside baseball.
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.820]   Normal people, as you said, care care about one thing, they're results.
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:49.820]   Does it work?
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:50.820]   Does it not work?
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:51.820]   Right now it works better than being.
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:52.820]   What are they using?
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.620]   I think people are using Google, aren't they?
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:57.020]   Well, they are, but they're starting to use Facebook for recommendation.
[00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.660]   All the message is Facebook, social services for...
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.660]   Well, I get a lot of stuff from Twitter.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.300]   You're absolutely right.
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:08.020]   If I want to look at what's going on, it's probably now 50/50 between news.google.com
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.020]   and Twitter.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.820]   I think that's a big change, absolutely right.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.020]   I have to say, I use social networks a lot more to get information.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.020]   I don't have to know.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.220]   What do you guys think of the deal that Bing has with Facebook?
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.460]   Now that you've got actual Facebook results alongside your Bing results, do you think
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.900]   people are more likely to go through Bing or is this going to help them at all?
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.900]   What do you guys think of that?
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.220]   I think it's great that they have them.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.220]   It's interesting they won't do Bing.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.220]   Do you use Bing?
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.700]   I think it's quite well done.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.380]   I think it's a terrific product.
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.820]   I think it's hard to compete in a situation where Google has this much market share.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.540]   I think it's a very good version of a social...
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.540]   Social is an opportunity, elite protocol.
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.540]   Yes, it's absolutely.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.300]   It's something that differentiates themselves from Google and which they've been trying
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.300]   to do.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.300]   They're not stupid.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.140]   They're not doing a brute force kind of fight with them.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.580]   They're doing a much more finding other features at Google.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.300]   Of course, for that to work, you've got to have a social graph on Facebook that's meaningful
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.300]   and quality.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.300]   I don't know.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.820]   Does everybody have that?
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:02.580]   Does my mom have a social graph on Facebook?
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:03.580]   Does she?
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:04.580]   I don't know.
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:05.580]   Does your mom...
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:06.580]   Actually, she's not on Facebook.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.580]   All right, we'll forget that.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.660]   She used to be, I scared her off.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.740]   Do people cultivate their social graph so that it's more valuable?
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.620]   Well, I mean, if you talk about people like your mom, maybe she hasn't changed the defaults
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.940]   to her attention from Microsoft being in the first place.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.500]   That's probably true, you're right.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.140]   But for the social graph thing, I mean, I'm actually quite picky when it comes to my Facebook
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.980]   friends because I want to make sure that if they're recommending stuff, I'm actually
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.140]   finding out really important stuff instead of like, "Oh, look, you little kid did this.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.140]   I don't care.
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.140]   That doesn't help me much."
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.660]   But if they're recommending an actual place to eat or the best place in town to have kids
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.220]   around to jump around and tire themselves out, I mean, that's useful.
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.980]   So it's just maybe you can...
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.980]   Oh, there's the phone to get in.
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:47.980]   Sorry, don't worry about it.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.340]   So maybe I should ask you, how is Babbie formed?
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.900]   Babbie formed?
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.900]   Never mind.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.660]   Let's take a break and come back with more.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:57.380]   You go get the phone and I will get this commercial.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.380]   It's fine.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:04.180]   Commercial mentioned for our good friends in New York, New York, the Squarespace folks.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.860]   I love Squarespace.
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:13.740]   Squarespace is hosting and software that makes it easy to create an exceptional website.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:20.620]   For all the talk about Facebook and Twitter and stuff, if you don't have your own website,
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.300]   you really don't control your persona on the web.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.300]   It's just absolutely vital.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:30.100]   And sometimes it's a little challenge if you don't have any own website.
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.100]   Where do I go?
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.100]   What do I do?
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.100]   How do I start it?
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.100]   Squarespace.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.740]   Now, I know everybody listening to the show has their own website, but maybe family or
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.500]   friends come to you and say, "Hey, I want to start a site.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.500]   Can you recommend this?
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.500]   This is the way to go."
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.820]   First of all, easy to use.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.780]   Go to squarespace.com/twit.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:49.500]   Click the green button and without a credit card, without any trouble, within just seconds,
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.020]   they can set up a site for two weeks free.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.780]   Again, password, actually you give it a site name, password, email address, and then a
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.780]   capture.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.780]   And that's it.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.940]   No credit card, nothing.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:06.820]   And you can use all the features of Squarespace, including their incredible templates, the social
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:12.900]   widgets that make it so easy to integrate social networks into your website, the statistics,
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:18.100]   the photo galleries, the forms, the forums.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.900]   And then if they can say, "Is this it?
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.900]   Is this my site?
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:22.900]   Is this what I want?"
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.060]   You could even do it for him and say, "I know Alex Lindsey's done that.
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.820]   He was at a restaurant the other day."
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.780]   And they didn't have a website.
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.860]   Before he left, he went on Squarespace, set up a quick site and said, "Look, you need
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:37.100]   a website."
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:41.260]   If you decide you want to keep it, $12 a month, that includes hosting and all the software.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:48.060]   But you can get there right now for free just by going to squarespace.com/twit.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.580]   I'm a big fan, I think you'll like it.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:55.060]   If you've got a blog or whatever you want to import it, you can move a WordPress type
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.860]   pad and blogger, all the big APIs.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:01.140]   But really, I think the thing to do is to tell your friends and family, at least set
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:06.820]   up this page so that you own your presence, your site on the web.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.380]   squarespace.com/twit.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:15.100]   The secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.380]   We can, do we talk about Watson?
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.380]   We haven't talked about Watson.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:19.380]   What did you think about that?
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.380]   I love Watson.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.380]   I love Watson too.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:22.380]   I'm trying to come up for D.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.380]   Oh, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.220]   Yes, against the greatest minds on the internet.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.380]   Do the computer bowl thing?
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:27.380]   That would be so much fun.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.380]   We did the computer bowl a couple of years ago.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.940]   I put Gates and Schmiller on the same thing.
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:31.940]   You did it originally.
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:32.940]   No, it would be fun.
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:33.940]   No, no, I think it would be fun.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.540]   Well, I will call Watson up immediately.
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:36.540]   Call Watson.
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:37.540]   I think I love the whole Watson.
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.540]   Hello, Kara.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.740]   I've been waiting for your call.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.380]   I knew you would call.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.380]   I thought it was great.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.380]   I enjoyed it.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.380]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.380]   It is impressive.
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.380]   It is impressive.
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:52.100]   And when they kill the human race, it might not be quite as good.
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.100]   Oh, come on.
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.100]   Wait a second.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.420]   Watson's only designed to play Jeopardy.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:59.820]   So a less conquering society is just playing Jeopardy than we're in trouble.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:02.860]   No, but once they get smart, I've actually were interviewing Ray Kurzweil next week.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:06.220]   And he's the guy who says that computers are going to be smart enough to design themselves.
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.660]   That's a whole lot of the Terminator.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.220]   But no, and I asked Ray about this.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:12.740]   This was pre-Terminator, but I asked Ray about this a few years ago.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.780]   And he said, no, no worry, because they'll revere us as their makers.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.780]   Oh, right, sure.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.780]   Hello, Terminator.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.780]   One, two, three.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:20.780]   Oh, we--
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.780]   Oh, my God.
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.340]   We made them.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.940]   We can always pull the plug, yes.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.660]   They're going to say we're God to them.
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:27.660]   Whatever.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:28.660]   Yeah, whatever.
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.660]   You saw Planet of the Apes.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.660]   You went in there.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.660]   God damn you.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.660]   You did it.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.660]   You dirty ape.
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:34.660]   Excuse me.
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.660]   You want to go on to the house?
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:36.660]   Damn you all to hell.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:37.660]   Thank you.
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:38.660]   I love that movie.
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:39.660]   I love that movie.
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:44.660]   Charlton Heston.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:45.660]   They're a little rubbery.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.660]   They're terrific.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.660]   No, they're a little rubbery.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.660]   It's the greatest movie ever made.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.660]   All right, as Liza was talking about movies.
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:52.660]   She'd win the Oscars.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.660]   It was cheated.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:54.660]   Cheated.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:58.660]   Why hasn't-- did Charlton Heston-- did he win for Big Her?
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.660]   Big Her?
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:00.660]   Ben Herr, did he ever win?
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.660]   No, I don't know.
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.660]   Chattram, this is-- I've already done the--
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.660]   Deserved it for omega man.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.660]   Singularity thing.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:08.660]   I've externalized my brain into the Chattram.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.660]   Check for me, will you?
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:11.660]   Yes, Leo.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.660]   Charlton Heston.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.660]   Oscar winner.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.660]   Wrecking.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:18.660]   This would be a good use for Watson right now.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.660]   Wrecking.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:20.660]   Wrecking.
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.660]   Another movie that should have won Oscar's Valley of the Dolls.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.660]   Wrecking.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.660]   Behind the Valley of the Dolls.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.660]   Any of the Valley of the Dolls.
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:28.660]   So--
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:29.660]   It's because movies that should have won the Oscar.
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:31.660]   The Oscars are tonight.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.660]   And--
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:35.660]   Let's see.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:43.660]   I want to go to this-- according to web trends, they looked-- what they did is they surveyed
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:51.660]   blogs, they surveyed websites, working-- yes, by the way, the Chattram says Charlton Heston
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:52.660]   won for Ben Herr.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:53.660]   Look at that.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:54.660]   Yeah, best actor.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.660]   Deserved it.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:56.660]   Great film.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.660]   Deserved it.
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.660]   According to IMDB awards.
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:04.660]   So, the Academy Award for most buzz-- here's a great infographic from Mashable.
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.660]   Leading actor.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:07.660]   It's pretty close.
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.660]   James Franco for 127 hours.
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.660]   I don't think so.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.660]   Eh.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:18.660]   Then Colin Firth, Javier Bardim for beautiful-- Jeff Bridges for True Grit, which-- by the way,
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.660]   brilliant True Grit.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.660]   Just not the dude.
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.660]   But he won last year, so he can't win again.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.660]   Jesse Eisenberg, Social Network, is in fifth place.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.660]   That's 12,000 mentions.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:27.660]   Best picture.
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:31.660]   But now, if you're asking the blogosphere, you know that they are going to say "Inception."
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.660]   Wrong.
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:33.660]   Crappy picture.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:34.660]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.660]   Social Network number two, Black Swan.
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:39.660]   Number three, the fighter number four, True Grit number five, 127 hours.
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:40.660]   Oh, this is on its hand.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:43.660]   King's speeches number-- yeah, it's upside down.
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:47.660]   Only 0.9% like the kids are all right.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.660]   Supporting actor Christian Bale for the fighter.
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:50.660]   He's right back for this section.
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:51.660]   Yeah, Finney's likes the Oscars.
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.660]   I could tell.
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.660]   He's really into it.
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:55.660]   Michelle Leo is probably going to win this.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.660]   You can-- oh, I could tell he's falling asleep.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:58.660]   Are you there, Ome?
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.660]   I am.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.660]   I am.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.660]   Just like Oscar is throwing interest me.
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:06.660]   Do you like a bunch of actors, self-congratulate themselves?
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:07.660]   I love it.
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.660]   It's the dream machine.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.660]   And they get gold zooms.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.660]   I mean, that's way more exciting than the Oscars.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:13.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.660]   In the basket, the gift basket.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.660]   Yeah, I mean, free gold, Motorola zooms.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:20.660]   I was talking to Woz was on the cruise and he did Dancing with the Stars.
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:21.660]   They do the same thing.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.660]   I guess this is the thing they do in Hollywood.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:24.660]   They give you a basket.
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:25.660]   Oh, swag.
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:26.660]   There's levels of swag.
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:28.660]   I know the fus-- there's the B level.
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:29.660]   There's the C level.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:30.660]   There's the A level swag.
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:31.660]   We should ask her to stay.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.660]   I think the gold zoom is A level.
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.660]   Absolutely.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:39.220]   A minimum line was a lower level swag person than it was on a hit television, so she gets
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.220]   to go to the A swag.
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:41.220]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.220]   So she's going up.
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:43.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.220]   I'm very sorry.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.660]   So he said that they give you a $75,000 basket of goodies.
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.660]   Right, they do.
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.620]   He said, had I known?
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:53.020]   Apparently, the guy from Jack acid.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.020]   No way.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.020]   I don't want that.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.020]   He taxes on it.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.180]   Because he said this like 30,000 in taxes.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.180]   He said there was not-- it was crap.
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.780]   There's three things I wanted.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.900]   And everything's valued at least.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:04.900]   So the taxes are through the roof.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.900]   They get you and hon.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.900]   But I think they--
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.380]   Johnny Knoxville, no, no.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.300]   It was Steve O or whatever his name is.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.220]   It was also on Dancing with the Stars.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.220]   He said, no, no.
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:14.220]   Thank you.
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:16.220]   I don't need any Bulgari perfume.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.220]   Right.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.220]   Did I pay 50% taxes on?
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.220]   Right.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.780]   Natalie Portman for Best Leading Actress.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.740]   According to the-- this is the blogosphere.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.820]   Who else is up for leading?
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:28.420]   Nicole Kidman for rabbit hole.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.380]   Jennifer Lawrence, Winters Bone, and Net Benning
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.380]   for the Kids Are All Right.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.380]   Michelle Williams for Blue Valentine.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.380]   I think she's going to win.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.380]   Net Benning.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.380]   You're kidding, really?
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.380]   Yep.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.380]   Oh, no.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:38.380]   I think we're Natalie Portman.
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:39.380]   We'll see.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.380]   She won.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:41.380]   She was crazy in that movie.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.380]   It's always good.
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:43.380]   You always win an Oscar.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.380]   If you're disabled or crazy--
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.380]   I think Pete, that movie freaked people out.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.380]   Well, it was.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.380]   It was creepy.
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.380]   I'm just saying.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.380]   I think the Oscar Academy--
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.380]   Oh, would you prefer it if we talk about Bollywood?
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.380]   Is there something that would make you happier?
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:53.380]   No, no.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:54.380]   I'm just listening.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.380]   I'm crilly.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.380]   Did you see any of the movies on?
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.140]   No, actually none.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.140]   I saw a salt.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.900]   You saw a social network, right?
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:04.740]   I did see social network more as work than movie, like entertainment.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.740]   Well, no, one of you don't enjoy this stuff.
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.300]   Salt was good, wasn't it?
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:09.300]   Salt was actually really good.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.300]   No.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.300]   Really?
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:12.300]   It was.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.300]   Hello, Angeline and Jolie with a gun.
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.300]   Enough.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.300]   Done.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.300]   Done.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.300]   Does she always have a gun?
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.300]   Exactly.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.300]   Done.
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.300]   Right on?
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.300]   It was there whipped cream involved in any point?
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.300]   I'm not going for that.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.300]   There is no need for whipped cream within Angeline.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.300]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.300]   And TMI.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.780]   Okay, I want to watch Salt.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:30.780]   I've not seen it.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:31.780]   Great.
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:32.780]   I don't notice it in the nominations.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:35.380]   You know, that was supposed to be a Tom Cruise movie.
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:36.900]   Interestingly enough, it was designed for a man.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:37.900]   That was a man's role.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.900]   I like it.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:39.900]   That's what made it so interesting.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:43.300]   The other thing I hear, the ending is actually good for a change and a movie like that.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.300]   But I can't spoil anything.
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:45.300]   Don't say anything.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.300]   I haven't seen it.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.300]   It's designed for a sequel.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300]   Ah.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.300]   Look at that.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.740]   Does that mean that Morgan Freeman come on?
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.540]   No, that's the wrong movie.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.540]   That's wanted.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.540]   I'm a big holly.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.700]   I used to cover holly.
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.700]   You do.
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:58.700]   You know this stuff.
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:59.700]   I'm very impressed.
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.700]   I know every celebrity in the world.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:01.700]   I'm very impressed.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.460]   So what do you think about that New York Times article that said "The Young or Drifting
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.460]   Away from Blogging"?
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.460]   No, blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:07.460]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.460]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.460]   Isn't that just a label issue?
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.660]   Because I mean, everyone's on Facebook.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:13.060]   Everyone's on Twitter, Twitter was a microblogging service.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:18.260]   But I mean, just because you write your thoughts on Facebook and not on blogspot, is that any
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:20.660]   different than a real blog?
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:21.660]   I guess if you're...
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.500]   I think the more interesting thing is...
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:29.060]   People confuse the medium for the message.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.060]   Ah, right.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.460]   I think that is such a huge problem.
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:36.060]   So not everybody can sit there and write 2,000 words.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:41.340]   Not everybody wants to share their whole life story in a blog post.
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:45.620]   They want to do it through either Twitter, through photos, through videos, through Facebook,
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:46.620]   whatever.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.300]   I mean, people are essentially sharing more.
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:51.700]   And I think that is the key thing.
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:56.140]   I think 10 years later, I've been blogging for more than 10 years now.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:59.260]   And people still haven't figured out what blogging is.
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.580]   Blogging is an act of sharing yourself.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.700]   It's not about a tool.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.300]   Tools don't define what you do with...
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:08.300]   You're right.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:09.300]   Right.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:13.500]   And I think that is so amazing that people still get it wrong all the time.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.020]   It's actually one of the reasons I always hated the word podcast.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.220]   It's focused on the distribution means not what you're doing.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.220]   Absolutely.
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.860]   You have proved in this studying studio.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:23.860]   Studying studio.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.180]   Blogging is also kind of diminutive in a way.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.460]   Diminish is what you're doing.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.460]   You're sharing yourself.
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:32.860]   It seems like one of those big jerky New York Times trend pieces that...
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:34.540]   That's what my Mullenweg seemed to say.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:35.540]   He said...
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.540]   I think they've done a couple.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.820]   They did one about how Silicon Valley valuations were up recently.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:41.020]   They sort of pull out the same story every two years.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.660]   And I don't know, it just seemed like...
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.380]   I think the trend piece.
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.380]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.220]   I think that was...
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:51.220]   I would say the headline was more sensationalist than the story.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.220]   It's actually a body.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:53.220]   That's what Matt Mullenweg said.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.220]   He said...
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:59.020]   The title was written by the editor, not the author, I'm sure, because as soon as the article
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:03.500]   gets passed two token teenagers would tumble and Facebook instead of blogging...
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.740]   Well, the title is kind of a blog.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.740]   Why do I define it?
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.740]   I think my own's completely right.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.820]   Yeah, it's not the medium.
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:10.820]   It's the message.
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:13.420]   I think you're so absolutely right on that one.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:18.020]   But is a four square check-in as good as a blog post?
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.020]   Yeah, why not?
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.420]   I mean, like if you would just write before I went to this diner last night, is that any
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.540]   different than just having it automated?
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.540]   Good point.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:30.620]   And let me say I tweeted about Hallie's diner nearby here, Leo, and it was excellent.
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.620]   You're in Petaluma.
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.980]   You're in Petaluma, the lovely Hallie's diner.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:34.980]   Fantastic.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.620]   Or you could have gone home, taken a picture, put it on your blog and said this is an awesome
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.620]   job.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.620]   A lot easier, actually, to tweet.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:42.620]   It's the same thing.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:43.620]   Exactly the same thing.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.620]   Yup.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.620]   Didn't do a picture.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.620]   I ate it too fast.
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:47.620]   I used to do this on a website.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.540]   I used to do this with tables and things before they had blogs.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:53.220]   So, like, when they were blogging, I'm like, "This is so much easier."
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.620]   I was thinking it was the same thing.
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.620]   It was just a webpage.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:56.620]   Bracket TDR.
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:57.620]   Bracket T-R.
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:59.620]   Hallie's breakfast slash T-R.
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:00.620]   Wow.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:02.620]   Yeah, that's lots of fun.
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:03.620]   Wow, that's...
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:05.620]   I'm so glad that's not the way it is now.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:06.620]   I did it too.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.580]   I'm right there with you.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:10.620]   The medium is not the message.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.620]   Best mohawk, by the way.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:14.620]   Best mohawk for the dog.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.620]   Absolutely.
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.140]   I think people have asked what kind of dog this is.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:20.620]   Again, it's a rescue dog, but they think it's a corgi terrier mix.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.620]   It's definitely terrier in there.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.620]   But when you hold him, it feels like a corgi.
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:25.620]   Yeah, he does.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.620]   Does this interest you more, Ohm?
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.620]   Oh, the dog is like, "No, I think I'm going to do this."
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:34.460]   But what Ohm was saying about the thing is, I mean, I think the big trend is everybody's
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:36.620]   communicating online and not in print newspapers.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:38.620]   So, I think that's really the big trend.
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.620]   I'd love to see that story.
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:41.620]   I got my Sunday times this morning.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:42.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.700]   And two of the columnists in the Sunday times were saying goodbye.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:50.860]   The ethicists said it's my last, the William Sapphire on language column, gone.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:54.300]   The New York Times is getting rid of most of its magazine colonists.
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.940]   I mean, this, that's a thin mag.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.940]   I didn't...
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:58.940]   Sometimes.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:14:59.940]   I'm just saying people are moving through this week.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:04.380]   I got four calls this week from friends in mainstream media looking to somehow associate
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.340]   with me because they're freaked out.
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.340]   Well, they should be.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:08.340]   It is not going well.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.340]   I think it's four years ago, four years ago.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.340]   Four or five years ago.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.780]   You left the journal to do all things do.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.780]   I did.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.940]   I did a column saying I will never write for print again unless they pay me a gigantic
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:16.940]   sum of money.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:17.940]   So that's interesting.
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.420]   See, I think a lot of people think all things do is the journal.
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.420]   It's not.
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.420]   Not at all.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.420]   Is it owned by Murdoch?
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:25.300]   It is owned by Dow Jones, which is owned by News Corp, which is owned by Murdoch.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.300]   So it's distantly...
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.300]   It's, you know, yeah, it's not...
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.300]   Yes, yes, absolutely.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:30.300]   But it's definitely not.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.300]   But it's the web.
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.300]   It's the web and it's not...
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.300]   We compete with the Wall Street Journal.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.300]   Right.
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:35.300]   I keep telling.
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:40.300]   Almost every time.
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.660]   I read it probably three to one over the journal.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.660]   And I'm a journal subscriber.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.660]   I get the...
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:45.660]   I get the paper.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:46.660]   It's sitting here on the table.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:48.220]   I think there's a celebrity site, though, obviously.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:49.220]   Would you?
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:50.220]   I wish you would.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:51.220]   All things see.
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.220]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.220]   We could do any letter.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.220]   We could do the 26 website.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.060]   All things A, all things B, all things C.
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.060]   Who would be you?
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.060]   I like it.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.420]   P would be porn, obviously.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.420]   You would be umbrellas.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:03.420]   You could be an umbrella.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.420]   But oh, I'm just going to run the porn site.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:06.420]   It's going to be great.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:07.420]   You could run all things B, all the other.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.420]   Look at this man.
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:09.420]   Look at this man.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:10.420]   Now I got him interested.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.420]   Clearly.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:12.420]   Clearly the right man for the job.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:13.420]   No.
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.420]   Oh, no.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:15.420]   How about all things Mohawk?
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.420]   That's an excellent idea.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:17.420]   I guess a Mohawk.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.420]   It was so freaky.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.420]   Right now the chat room is registering all these URLs.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.420]   They are.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:23.420]   They're getting them all.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.420]   They're getting them all.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.420]   They're getting them all.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.420]   Squatters.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.420]   Uh-huh.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:33.380]   Well, anyway, clearly the web and the internet and all of this is the next generation.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.380]   Of media.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.380]   It's the evolution of the media.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:43.380]   You know, I think people assume that things will never change.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:48.380]   I think that's so why is it so hard for people to come to terms with that.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.380]   That things always change.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:54.380]   Like whether it's the media or it's the society itself.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:57.380]   And I think that's exactly what's happening right now.
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:02.380]   And you know, that's why people say, oh, blogging is, is, is, you know,
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.380]   coming at an expense or something else.
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.380]   And you say, no, it's not.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:08.380]   It just, everything is evolving.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.380]   Things change.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.380]   That's what technology is all about.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:14.380]   Humans are, and I think this actually is a Ray Kurzweil point.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:18.380]   Humans are singularly unable to see change.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.380]   You know, we, we are kind of narrow and we very linear.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.380]   And what we really don't see is exponential change.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.380]   The kind of change we are in right now.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.380]   We're totally unable to see it.
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:29.380]   You know, I'd say, Ohm was the first person to really, in the mainstream media.
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.380]   Ohm worked for Fortune Magazine.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:35.380]   And he was the first person to really see it years before we started anything
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:36.380]   and doing it.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:38.380]   I'd be curious what tipped him off.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.380]   How'd you know, Ohm?
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:44.380]   Well, you know what tipped me off is when we, I was doing giga Ohm,
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:49.380]   I was getting more reader interaction from the blog than I was from my magazine.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:50.380]   Me too.
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.380]   That's so funny.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.380]   Yep.
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.380]   Yep.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:58.380]   It was, and I sold my book initially when I wrote it back in the day.
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:04.380]   And pretty much entirely through the blog, everything was, you know, people wanted to
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.380]   do, wanted the interaction.
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:09.380]   And I think I realized that I said, Oh, this is huge.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:17.380]   I mean, it makes no sense to have a big corporate infrastructure to do basically the
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:24.380]   main, main task of a media organization is to present information to its ultimate
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.380]   customers who are the readers.
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.380]   And if you don't do that, you don't have a business.
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:34.380]   And I think most of the big companies still don't quite understand that that's the problem
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:38.380]   they have is that they're not serving the needs of their customer.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.380]   Right.
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:42.380]   So they're not doing the job they're supposed to do.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.380]   It just brings great journalism.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:50.380]   Why is it that Cara can do it or I can do it with a little tiny staff and the other guys
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:55.380]   can't do it with such massive infrastructure is because they're focusing on the wrong
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:56.380]   things.
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:19:02.380]   I think, you know, our business, when I started, when I started doing it, it was a very clear
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:03.380]   realization.
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:05.380]   I'm in the business of making my customers happy.
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.380]   My customers are readers.
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:09.380]   If they're happy, everything else will fall out.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:10.380]   That was it.
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:13.380]   That was such a simple, you know, it wasn't simple though, because you were very prescient.
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:17.380]   I have to say, what Ohm was doing was it was the inspiration for us for sure.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.380]   And we absolutely.
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:22.380]   That's one of the things that Ohm said that, you know, the giant infrastructure, they have
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.380]   this giant infrastructure so they can't actually do it.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.380]   I actually find it to be a hindrance for a lot of companies.
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:28.380]   They go, okay, we want to go and be nimble.
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:31.380]   But the thing is they don't want to get, they don't want to continue.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:35.380]   Actually, they want to continue doing the things the way they used to, which means layer after
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.380]   layer after layer.
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:40.380]   But if you're working with a small staff, you can communicate so much faster and get things
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:43.380]   done so much faster and change really easy.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:48.380]   But once you start adding layers of infrastructure, you start running into problems, I think.
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:52.380]   We don't have the worldwide headquarters, Volting's D is in my backyard.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:57.380]   Well, you know, I'm a little sympathetic as a business owner.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:01.380]   When you design a business, you design it around a business plan.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.380]   And the business plan includes how you're going to make money.
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:08.380]   And a newspaper was designed, let's say, around the business plan of display ads making money.
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:12.380]   And when things change, it's not quite so easy to change a business on a dime and to change
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.380]   your business model and change your revenue model.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:19.380]   Particularly since anything you do on the web these days cannibalizes your existing business model.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.380]   Very hard for a company to do that.
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:25.380]   No, no, no, I think this is where I would disagree with you.
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.380]   Again, probably for the first time.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:32.380]   I think media companies are in the business of information.
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:36.380]   You know, they define themselves through the medium, right?
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:42.380]   They do not realize that they are all about selling information, whether it is sold as
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:50.380]   a newspaper or as an online service or as a TV show or as a podcast or whatever it might be.
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:56.380]   This is why you see a company like Bloomberg thrive in this down market is because they're
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:58.380]   in the business of information, right?
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:05.380]   What you are doing is actually you're selling information in the focus on people who matter
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:10.380]   the most in your business who are your readers or viewers, right?
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:11.380]   No, I agree with you.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:14.380]   It's the same thing they said about the railroads that they didn't understand.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.380]   They thought they were in the railroad business.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.380]   They didn't understand what they were in the transportation business.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.380]   So they lost the trucking industry.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:25.380]   But the problem is, the point I'm making is you might even know that.
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:30.380]   But if your business model is based around something obsolete, it is non-trivial to change it.
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.380]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.380]   It is not true.
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.380]   One of the things that I think is important and we're making the bet on it.
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.380]   I know what it does is on quality.
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:37.380]   And so do you.
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.380]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:39.380]   You have to.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.380]   That's the internet era because junk will out.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:42.380]   No, it's eventually.
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:44.380]   That's why I don't worry about demand media.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:45.380]   Well, no, it will.
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:46.380]   And people want quality.
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:47.380]   They'll see it immediately.
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.380]   So we'll see how that goes.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:51.380]   It's definitely transitional and it's still experimental.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:54.380]   I mean, we make most of our money in the conferences, obviously.
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.380]   But still, it's still the right direction.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.380]   I don't think we disagree, Om.
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.380]   I think we agree 100%.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:02.380]   You got to understand what business you're in.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.380]   Well, thank God.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:08.380]   I was going to feel bad about disagreeing with you.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:09.380]   No, I agree with you.
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:12.380]   I think that you have to understand your business.
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:15.380]   Most people don't do such a good job of knowing what they do.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:22.380]   I think that is the problem is that we basically define, I wrote a piece about this recently
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.380]   on the site, which got changes.
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:27.380]   It's good, but it's also really, really hard.
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:29.380]   And I shared my story.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.380]   I've been trying to give up.
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:39.380]   I've been smoke free for three years now and not a single day goes by when I don't need to fight that earth.
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:43.380]   You know, change is so much harder on an individual basis.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:51.380]   It's much tougher for companies because they are also predisposed to do certain things in a certain way.
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:53.380]   They have an investment in it.
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:54.380]   So that is the key thing.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:23:00.380]   I mean, this is one of the main reasons why media companies find themselves in this trouble,
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:04.380]   is because they have these behaviors which they don't want to get rid of.
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:10.380]   They don't want to kind of say, "Okay, we are going to stop doing this."
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:17.380]   I think it's been pretty clear that the internet was going to be a destructive force for the newspaper business.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.380]   It's for about 12 years now.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.380]   Pretty clear.
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:22.380]   They still haven't done anything about it.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:28.380]   I think that's because they refuse to embrace any kind of change.
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:33.380]   And this is why you see newer entities come up.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:39.380]   That is why opportunity arises for all things D or D or anybody else.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:44.380]   It's because you're willing to make a bet on the change.
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:49.380]   And unlike established businesses, you don't have a business to cannibalize.
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:51.380]   You don't have infrastructure that you have to reinvent.
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.380]   We have a business to cannibalize.
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.380]   You do?
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.380]   Well, the journal.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.380]   We're 100% on it by now, John.
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:58.380]   Which makes all things kind of an interesting play.
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:23:59.380]   We're a weird little.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:00.380]   We call it a...
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.380]   Because you look at the daily, for instance, which is clearly an attempt to preserve that model.
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.380]   Whatever.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:04.380]   I'm not sure what they're doing there.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.380]   Well, it's an attempt to preserve a subscription model without...
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:09.380]   We call ourselves the crazy cousins.
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:11.380]   And I think they think of us as the crazy cousins.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.380]   Well, and to their credit, they let you do that.
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.380]   You know what I mean?
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:17.380]   But what I really want to do is direct, obviously, for us.
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.380]   Hey, if Justin Bieber can get a haircut, you can change your business.
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:22.380]   I'm not insulting them.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.380]   I'm saying.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.380]   I'm saying.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:28.380]   There's a guy who said to himself, "The bowl cuts not working.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:29.380]   I'm going different."
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.380]   Well, he's not quite that different.
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.380]   I'm a believer.
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.380]   You're a believer?
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.380]   I'm also a fan-alow, but that's a question.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.380]   Not a Barry Mantle of fans.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:38.380]   Oh, don't even start.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:39.380]   Don't insult the man.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:40.380]   He's a genius.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:41.380]   Thank you.
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:42.380]   I like Elvis too.
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.380]   I have no opinion on those two.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:45.380]   Are you kidding?
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:47.380]   Mal, you know every word to Copicabana.
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:48.380]   I know you're...
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:51.380]   I have no opinion on this, so I don't know who they are.
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:54.380]   I don't know what to say now.
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:55.380]   I really don't.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.380]   I think we better wrap this up.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:58.380]   I don't think we can go anywhere from that.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:00.380]   I wonder if Bieber's going to the Oscars.
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:01.380]   Oh, sure.
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:03.380]   That's the movie I want to see.
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:07.380]   He's dating Selena Gomez supposedly, or fake.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:12.380]   I want to see Barry Mantleau and Justin Bieber in a duet.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:13.380]   Whoa.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:15.380]   I will buy that song.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:17.380]   Yeah, I'll buy that song.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:19.380]   Well, there's the market research.
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.380]   Oh, Mal, like, we'll buy that song.
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.380]   And on that note, I'd like to thank you all for joining us.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.380]   We have an Oscar to go to.
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:28.380]   Cara Switchers, thank you so much for actually being in studio and bringing...
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:29.380]   I am thrilled.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.380]   I'm going to move that a little bit now.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:31.380]   Yeah, good.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:32.380]   Now that you know where's a good breakfast,
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.380]   you can get some Quermial pancakes.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:34.380]   You've already reset.
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.380]   Our studio will be right across the street from there.
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:37.380]   I love the Petaluma.
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:38.380]   Love and Me, St. Petaluma.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.380]   Cara is at allthingsd.com.
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:43.380]   Too late to go to the conference, but we'll look forward to seeing the live stream.
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:44.380]   I think that's great.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.380]   I look forward to seeing the live stream.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:46.380]   I'm not live.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.380]   I'm not live.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:48.380]   Sorry.
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:49.380]   Some things.
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:50.380]   There'll be three speakers.
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.380]   Live.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:52.380]   Not so long.
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.380]   And it can be involved in Dell discussion with you, but three of them will be live.
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:55.380]   Okay.
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:56.380]   Okay.
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:00.380]   Also, thanks so much to IAS Actar for joining us from this old nerd.
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.380]   So you guys should watch it.
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:05.660]   If you're trying to have a tech forward life or house or just carrying tech on you, you
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.660]   should watch this old nerd.
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:10.300]   We just showed people how to build a PC last week with the folks from Hot Hardware.com.
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:11.300]   So cool.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.300]   Thanks for having me on guys.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.300]   We're going to have you back.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:18.220]   In fact, you see, I has a lot on TNT going forward.
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:20.740]   Also Om Malek, always a pleasure to have you on Om.
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:25.420]   You're always fun and you could disagree with me all you like because if you say it, I
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:26.420]   believe it.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:28.620]   No, I don't want to disagree with you.
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:32.060]   That's like disagreeing with Yoda.
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:38.620]   I want your Oscar pics though.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.700]   I want Leo's Oscar.
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:41.980]   I have my ballot here somewhere.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:44.700]   I think a sweep for the social network.
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.300]   Not the social network for the King's speech.
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:48.300]   Sweet for the King's speech.
[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:50.260]   Sweet for the King's speech.
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:51.260]   That's my prediction.
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.260]   Director movie.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.260]   She didn't see any of the movies.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.260]   What was your pick?
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:58.460]   I'll go with half your pics and half of Leo's.
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:02.460]   I actually do want Angelina Joliet to wear.
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:03.460]   She's not nominated.
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:07.340]   That's why I said I don't want her to wear.
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.540]   She should just get up and steal the Oscar.
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:10.540]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:14.140]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here and we will see you next time.

[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:47.980]   I will send you a ticket.
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:48.980]   You're coming.

[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:55.980]   Great minds.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:56.980]   Think alike.
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:57.980]   You're kidding.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:58.980]   Friday.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:27:59.980]   Friday.

[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:17.140]   I was going to be watching on Twitter.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:18.140]   Yes.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:19.140]   Thank you.
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:20.140]   That's right.
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:21.140]   I'm over its pace.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.140]   Free drinks on the bottom.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.140]   Yes.
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:24.140]   If it doesn't happen.
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:25.140]   Free drinks on the bottom.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.140]   Nobody will remember.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:27.940]   I feel free to give away his money.
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:28.940]   That's what Steve does to me.
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:31.820]   Steve Jobs always says, oh yeah come on Leo and then it never happens.
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:32.820]   Oh I see.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:34.820]   Another twin.
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.820]   We'll see you next time.
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:36.820]   Yoda really is in the can.
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:37.820]   Bye bye.
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:39.420]   I wish I had that editor's cut.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:40.420]   Please for real life.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:41.420]   All right.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:42.420]   Do it a twin.
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:43.420]   All right.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:44.420]   Do it a twin.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.420]   Oh, excuse me.
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.420]   Do it a twin.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:47.420]   There.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:52.420]   There's nothing better than a dog in a funny hat.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.420]   Oh, not liking it though.
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.260]   It's a nice face.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.260]   Or his face is good.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.140]   Oh, yeah, we only have the best.
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.140]   That's a fancy fit.
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:01.340]   Oh, we have very fancy for you.
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:02.340]   But wait a minute.
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:03.340]   It's not as fancy as this face.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:04.500]   This face is nice.
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.900]   This is chief twit fans.
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:07.900]   Oh.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:08.900]   That's regulation side.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.900]   I think you should put that as something.
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:12.380]   It's just a scoash bigger.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.980]   I have to do these recollections of Fred Flintstone.
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:15.980]   It is.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:16.980]   Oh my god.
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:17.980]   The moose.
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:18.980]   The moose lives.
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:19.980]   Whatever.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:20.980]   And Keith.
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.780]   Yeah, I want to go to the toilet.
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:24.420]   Yeah, I'll get you one of those.
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:25.420]   Absolutely.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:32.420]   Do it a twin.
