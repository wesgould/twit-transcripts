[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.240]   I like that.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.640]   You know, another thing you should work on
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.360]   is excuses for being late
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.960]   because your car broke down.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.000]   Just say, I'm under the car right now.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.880]   John will say that all the time.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.040]   Also here, and I'm really glad to get them on
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.400]   for the first time, but I've known Julio for a long time.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.040]   Look, you're in Minnesota now.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.080]   You can say "Julio," right?
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.040]   Well, Julio is actually my family nickname,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.960]   so all my relatives call me "Julio."
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.000]   So if I say Julio, "Okay, there's a para."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.080]   That's really silly.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.800]   That's very well pronounced.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.080]   Julio, congratulations.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.080]   Julio is a writer for in Minnesota for the St. Paul.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.880]   What is it?
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.520]   Pioneer Press.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   Pioneer Press.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.080]   Is this the only newspaper written and covered wagons?
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.280]   [LAUGHS]
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.080]   I grew up in Puerto Rico, and when I applied for--
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.720]   to go to college in Minnesota, I asked somebody,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.520]   "Have seriously-- do you guys get around in canoes?"
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.040]   [LAUGHS]
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.120]   Did you really?
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.160]   You didn't know.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.280]   I was only half serious.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.400]   He also has his own blog, reports on technology,
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.280]   and I see the new blog, "Twit in Business."
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.040]   This is your new book?
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.920]   Yeah, I wrote a business book about Twitter, basically,
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.080]   a manual for businesses that are thinking
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.360]   of getting on Twitter, which a lot of companies
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.440]   are these days.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.080]   Very interesting.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.240]   Really interesting.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.720]   Well, it's great to have you, Julia, finally on the show.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.040]   The book is available on Amazon.com.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.640]   Twitter means business how microblogging can
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.000]   help or hurt your company, or you can read him
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.640]   on his blog for the St. Paul Pioneer Press.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   Yeah, I think--
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.920]   What is the URL for the blog?
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.120]   Let's get that on here.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.040]   It's yourtechwebblog.com.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.160]   It's kind of a mouthful.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.760]   Cool.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.600]   So what is the big story?
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.000]   Well, wait, before we do that, Leo,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.320]   why don't we-- I like to ask him a quick question about--
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.840]   Yes.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.440]   --since he wrote this book.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.240]   What is your conclusion about Twitter and business,
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.600]   and what is some of the creative ways people use it?
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.280]   Well, I did basically a lot of case studies of companies
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   ranging from Dell to Whole Foods to Comcast.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.160]   And the research was really interesting in eye opening
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.720]   because it showed me how Twitter, which
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.600]   is a very minimalist tool, is very malleable.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.480]   It can be adapted to a wide variety of purposes.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.360]   And I was just amazed at all the different ways
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.160]   that companies use Twitter internally for communication
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.760]   externally for customer service.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.120]   Comcast, the Comcast Cares guy, which was on Twitter a while
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.680]   back.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.880]   He's one of the big profiles in my book.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.200]   I'm very, very impressed with him.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   So it was a blast.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.840]   I'm not a business writer per se,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.160]   but it was interesting writing a business book,
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.120]   doing all this research as a journalist,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.840]   and just building up a little social media expertise.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.240]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.040]   I wonder, though, the Reuters Bureau on Second Life
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.880]   just closed.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.800]   I thought even when they--
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.600]   Why would they have to close?
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   Just leave it open.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.960]   No, who's going to go there if they're not doing anything?
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.680]   But I think-- remember when everybody was going
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.680]   to Second Life, there was the Norwegian console and the stuff.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.560]   And everybody thought, oh, this is the next big thing.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   And then people realized, no, it's just a bunch of people
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.480]   with naked body clothing wandering around pretending
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.960]   to have sex.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.280]   And they left.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.160]   And they said, this isn't--
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.520]   And I wonder if--
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.560]   In other words, the emperor had no clothes
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.680]   with literally when it came to Second Life.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.960]   But I wonder if Twitter's the same thing,
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.400]   or if there really is some lasting--
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.200]   Well, I don't know.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.400]   Because one thing Second Life is screwy compared to Twitter.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   Yeah, no, you're right about that.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.360]   I mean, Twitter is just a simple tool that--
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.600]   I find it very valuable.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.000]   I use it specifically for just to get some feedback
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.320]   with my audience a little faster than email.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.920]   It's quicker stuff.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.120]   And it doesn't get left in the box.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.920]   And I try to respond to people who have interesting questions.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   And then I also use them as a resource.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.240]   Because they're--
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.320]   You know, like when I recently went to Portugal,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.720]   so I Twittered that I was going to go there.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.680]   And I had about-- and I said, is anybody
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.120]   going to be around or something?
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.400]   One of these guys, Vitor, from--
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.160]   and actually, there's--
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.760]   oh, I got it.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.040]   Now he's going to get mad that I forgot to mention.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.840]   I'll have to dig it up and bring it up.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.800]   Vitor.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.520]   Well, Vitor was the guy I went to get a camera shooting with.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.520]   And--
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.200]   So you met him on Twitter?
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.320]   I met a bunch of these guys.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.360]   Apparently, there's about 40 guys on Twitter and Lisbon or more
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.520]   that are all connected in the same circle.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   And I went and had dinner with a group of them.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.800]   And then the next thing-- you know,
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.320]   I'm out shooting photos with another group of them.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.600]   The next day, we spent like seven hours--
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.960]   in fact, we're going to put up a flicker feed.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.840]   Of our best stuff.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.600]   I shot eight 12 gigabytes of pictures
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.440]   with an Olympus 520 in a bunch of lenses.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.200]   And we got some good shots, I think,
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.640]   because it was--
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.360]   but it's all through Twitter.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.840]   It's all through Twitter.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.920]   And these guys, by the way, were all professionals.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.240]   It wasn't a bunch of kids.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.120]   I think Second Life was just way too complicated for new users.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.680]   Twitter is so easy to get started.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.960]   They just got to text something to 404-004, and they're done.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.480]   Right.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.840]   And Second Life, you've got to set it up on your computer.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.880]   You've got to know where to go.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.080]   You've got to learn this quirky interface.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.600]   So it's just everything.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.280]   You've got to make money, and you've got to eat food.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.000]   I think, though, that there's a little bit of a flavor
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.360]   of the week still happening, flavor of the month happening.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.960]   With Twitter?
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.320]   Well, yeah, but you hate Twitter.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.440]   You immediately took a dislike to it
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.640]   once you realized that, rather late into the game,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.240]   I might add.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.440]   I think, you know, months went by before you realized
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.800]   that it might impinge on your trademark.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.280]   Wow.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.000]   And then you jumped ship to the other competitor,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   which died.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.760]   Jai-ku.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.720]   Jai-ku.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.480]   And then you've kind of toyed with starting your own.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.800]   I have my own Twitter, but I'm not army.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.240]   I sense that there is a resentment that deep-seated,
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   that affects your opinion about it.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.560]   That's what Gilmore said yesterday.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.200]   He said, it's you're too emotional about it.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.960]   But I'm trying not to be emotional about it.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.840]   And you look at all these people you have following you.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.760]   That's the thing that's the irony.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.680]   I mean, you're moaning grown.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.320]   I think that's where I moan and groan about it,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.880]   because, okay, it seems like I've helped
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.280]   build Twitter a little bit.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.120]   But what do I get out of it?
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   What's in it for me?
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.920]   Well, you're not using it to get anything out of it.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.080]   If you would, like I do--
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.600]   Well, I do.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   Sometimes I get some stuff out.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.920]   I asked, for instance, what's the best pen to buy?
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.760]   And I got a lot of answers.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.720]   Yeah, well, now, here's the problem I have with it,
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.200]   now that you brought that up.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.960]   I'll ask a question to my legions.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.080]   I got about 35,000, a little less than 35,000.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.600]   And so I sent out a question.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.840]   And somebody answers it within a few minutes.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.080]   And they get the right answer.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.360]   And then the answers keep pouring in.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   The same answers.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.160]   And from all--
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.520]   Oh, no.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.400]   So I'm getting-- and I can't say, hey, thanks.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.000]   Once and once I say, the question's been answered.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.520]   Thanks a lot.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.120]   But no, nobody pays attention to that.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   And they keep coming in.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.560]   And then pretty soon it's like, how come you're not answering me?
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.520]   How come you didn't acknowledge it?
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.120]   Did you buy that such and such a device?
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.080]   And that becomes complicated.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.520]   I don't like the fact that the feedback loop is not
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.040]   enough of a community.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   Yeah, they'll tweet something two weeks later.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.080]   And then you'll tweet something back.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.520]   And they won't find it for a month later,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.400]   because they can't find replies.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.360]   And it's a mess depending on the tool set you use.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.240]   But I think over time, Twitter has gone and developed.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.360]   Hopefully they'll develop something new instead
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.920]   of relying on all the third party developers
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.080]   to do everything for them.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.960]   Something's happening.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.600]   I'm not saying that something's not
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.320]   happening with the idea of kind of microblogging
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.440]   and all that stuff.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.240]   Anyway, you're the one that sold me on the idea.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.000]   I find it annoying that you hate it so much now.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.840]   I don't hate it.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   It's like it's sucking me in and then next thing you know,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.440]   you're--
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:37.960]   I don't hate it.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.280]   It's not that I hate it.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.000]   It's I'm trying to figure out where the real utility is.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.720]   And it's not at Twitter.com.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.360]   Well, it's very utilitarian for me when I went to Lisbon.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.000]   I can assure you.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.360]   I would have had two or three.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.680]   I'd had at least one day of not having any fun shooting
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.000]   photos and not knowing where to go,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.560]   because these guys took me around.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.640]   I would have never worked out this--
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.920]   Well, that's any social network.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.400]   Facebook could have given you the same--
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.280]   Yeah, probably.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.400]   Any social network would help you.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.120]   But this was the--
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.880]   And that's the future.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.040]   I'm not saying that-- look, I'm not saying that--
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.160]   it's like saying, oh, the internet, it's never going anywhere.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.720]   I mean, clearly there's some future.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.680]   There's a future.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.840]   You might have something.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.880]   It just seems--
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.520]   Yeah, guys, can we stick a step back for a minute and listen?
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.240]   You got to wait longer, Bwanna.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.240]   I had to get it in sometime.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920]   Is that Patrick Norton?
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.280]   No, it's not Patrick Norton.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.960]   It's Bwanna McCall.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.960]   That's funny.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.200]   I have the wrong CG up.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.840]   I have the Patrick Norton CG up for a moment there.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.440]   OK, let's take to Facebook.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.600]   I don't know if you have the same level.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.040]   I mean, when I met up with these guys in Lisbon,
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.120]   they're all mature males, and they were not kids.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.000]   I think with Facebook, you're going to run a lot of--
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.500]   That's true.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.480]   I would say Twitter's skews older.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.760]   Is that your experience too, Julio,
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.280]   that it's a little bit of an older audience?
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.640]   Yeah, if I go before a college crowd,
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.920]   and I say the word Twitter, and I ask for a show of hands,
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.880]   how many people use Twitter?
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.040]   I hear crickets.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.760]   It does tend to steal a little older.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.400]   I find that fascinating because--
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.560]   Doesn't that tell you that it, in fact,
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.480]   isn't really the future?
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.480]   What about Eric?
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.560]   Does he use your son, John?
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.160]   Does he use--
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.400]   Use a Skype.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.040]   Use a Skype for I am.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.600]   Well, actually, he uses everything.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.040]   But everybody at Mevio, we all use Skype for I am.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.800]   It's our I am network.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.000]   That's-- I find that fast.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.160]   And well, you got Skype there anyway.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.920]   Might as well use it.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.640]   Yeah, and then people-- we used to have
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.600]   a lot of people in England, and so you needed to talk to them.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.520]   And it was the easiest way to do it.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.920]   Well, I think the Twitter thing-- I think it has something to do.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.240]   I think the age thing skews that way
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.520]   because it's kind of like lazy blogging.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.080]   It is.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.880]   That's why I like it, because I don't have to type--
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.680]   And I think a lot of people, when they get older,
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.400]   they don't have as much time on their hands,
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.960]   like some college kid might, who they think they're busy,
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   but they're not.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.280]   And they can get forward to it.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.320]   Because I've said a Facebook accounts a couple of times,
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.400]   and I can never bring myself to ever doing any more work on it.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.000]   Right.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.320]   It's just to work.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.080]   Facebook is just-- it's really-- I find it really complicated.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.480]   It's just kind of a hassle.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.600]   The minimalism of Twitter really appeals to me.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.680]   That's really where it's successful, I guess,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.000]   is just what it is.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.240]   It's also where-- well, for at least the first a lot of people
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.080]   went, but is that all there is?
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.120]   But maybe that nowadays we want to--
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.160]   That's the problem, actually.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.560]   I think that's what's going to kill it eventually.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:19.920]   You're going to--
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.800]   By the way, Leo, you're all over my book.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.960]   I really admired what you've done with Microblog.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.680]   I've been doing it on different platforms.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.480]   The Twitter armies and your Twitter activities.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.000]   I've watched you do the Microblogging thing for a long time,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.880]   and nicely done.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.880]   Thank you.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.160]   Anyway, when I said that that's going to be the downfall
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.280]   of Twitter, what I mean by that is not that this minimalist,
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.520]   it's that it's not going to stay that way.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.120]   Because everybody has to have creeping featureism.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.480]   So the next thing-- let's add this, and let's add that.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.040]   And then it becomes more and more complicated.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.840]   Let's have home pages for the individuals.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.800]   And the next thing, it's going to be useless.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.760]   Well, isn't Twitter kind of an Apple-like in that it resists that?
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.480]   They seem to be.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.880]   Yeah, they seem to not want to add features.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.600]   In fact, if anything, they've been taking features out.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.840]   Well, they've been changing things around.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.440]   They've taken a new approach to stability.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.000]   Let's remove the things that--
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.280]   People will use things from the server,
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.960]   and then everything will work.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.080]   That'll take care of it.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.760]   Well, whatever.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.280]   So I know the audience out there hates us talking about Twitter.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:21.320]   Oh, they do.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.200]   But it's--
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.440]   You can't help it because there's something happening.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.040]   It's trying to get a handle on it.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.760]   It's not the company necessarily Twitter.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.320]   One of the things we're going to do
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.320]   is add a text stream to the video and audio streams
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.840]   we're already doing of clickable links, comments,
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.160]   suggestions that will then be stored.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.680]   You could read it later.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.480]   It's like kind of real-time show notes,
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.800]   but from all of the listeners.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.840]   Right.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.480]   And that's similar in a way to Twitter.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.520]   They'll be using Jabber, so it'll be truncated to short.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.920]   You don't have to be short.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.720]   It'll be like I am messages kind of.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.560]   So what--
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.360]   I think I am is really what's happening here.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.040]   It's not so much Twitter as short conversations.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.760]   I kind of use it as I am personally.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.480]   But with a large group that you can subscribe to or follow,
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.200]   I think that's really what's happening is that we're seeing--
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.680]   in addition to email, we're seeing a short--
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.960]   it's kind of short form email system.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.480]   And Twitter is just the first iteration of that, I think.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.040]   Well, one of the things I've noticed
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.720]   if you use it as an IAM system is that you also send out
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.320]   these messages to everybody else.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.080]   So each-- if you have a big group of followers,
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.800]   it's almost like a club.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   Yes.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.400]   So it's like open IAM.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.800]   So it's like if I am anybody in the group,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.360]   unless they send a private message.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.120]   But if I am anybody in the group with an answer to a question,
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.320]   everybody, if they want to or not, gets to read it.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.760]   Or they could follow you.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.080]   If they want.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.280]   I think also one of the things people like about it
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.320]   is that you can shape your information--
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.560]   look, we are-- all of everything that's going on right now.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.480]   I would say I would submit everything that's going on right
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.000]   now is about tapping into the vast stream of information
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.360]   that the internet is and somehow massaging it
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.800]   so that it's useful to you.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.440]   And the thing that Twitter did that solved a big problem
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.360]   was choosing who you followed, eliminate spam.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.880]   It lets you shape the stream that you receive
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.600]   to be the most useful to you.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.760]   And everybody uses Twitter, has a different shape
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.960]   that they pursue.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.040]   I kind of try to follow news--
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.360]   people with news links.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.360]   But that's what you can do.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.920]   And that's kind of the power of Twitter.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.000]   But really, it's just a first-- in my opinion,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.840]   a first iteration at a scheme to somehow make it possible
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.640]   to follow what the hell's going on in this vast sea
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.920]   of information.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.760]   Does that make sense?
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.440]   Yeah, as a journalist.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.680]   As a journalist, I've just found Twitter so incredibly eye
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.560]   opening just because it allows me to throw a question out
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.360]   there, tap the expertise of a high--
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.280]   But you and John, as journalists,
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.680]   are using it as a query mechanism.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.080]   Exactly.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.840]   As kind of--
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.000]   Not to access, by the way.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.080]   I consider that you have a responsibility
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.240]   to these people following you.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.360]   So I try to provide them with certain kinds of insight
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:11.800]   and pressure.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.640]   You got that right away.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.400]   You put content out right away.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.880]   I think that was a secret to your success.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.280]   Content and nut.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.200]   And so now I've got all these people that gave me feedback
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.800]   that they want stuff about wine.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.520]   So every time I run into a good bottle of wine,
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.760]   someplace which I do often, I tell them where it is
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.560]   and what it's going to cost and they can go get it.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.080]   And that seems to be a whole group of people out there
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.600]   that are just really-- they're locked into that idea.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.720]   So I mean, and then I also find when I have good links
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.880]   and I don't want to necessarily send it to my blog, which
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.560]   I do once in a while.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.600]   I'll just send them some funny stuff.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.960]   So Apple did an interesting thing this week.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.400]   Well, I can't remember who it was.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   It was the Washington Post.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:48.880]   I think so.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.720]   The security column, Brian Krebs, security column
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.120]   on the Washington Post discovered an Apple techno, which
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.480]   had been there for some time suggesting
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.960]   that people who use Mac and Tasha's
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.680]   ought to be running an antivirus A. And this
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.760]   was kind of the funny part.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.160]   They said, don't all use the same one.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.680]   Here's three, because we don't want virus authors
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.800]   to know what you're using.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.120]   So mix it up, guys.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.760]   Journal-- the Washington Post published this information.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.360]   Literally, two days later, Apple pulls it down.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.560]   Every time I saw this, I tried to explain what's
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.320]   the irony of this, is that they published something
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.600]   in their website that they want people to read
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.760]   until somebody actually reads it a year and a half later.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.040]   This was published June 2007 is when it was posted.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.720]   But Brian Krebs discovers it, and suddenly it's a big story.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.760]   And then they all pull it down.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.440]   It says, well, I guess we do-- I'm thinking,
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.760]   do you want us reading this?
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.480]   You put out something saying you want people
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.640]   to use antivirus.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.760]   And then somebody actually reads this
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.560]   and decides to make it even more public by talking about it
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.520]   in the Washington Post.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.600]   And then you pull it off.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.560]   I mean, you didn't want it read, or I don't get it.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.440]   Dwight Silver made almost--
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.560]   It almost seems like an inside joke
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.520]   at someone on the server team at Apple.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.360]   Say, hey, we're going to put an antivirus article up.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.960]   Let's see how long before someone knows.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.760]   And then a year and a half later, it blows up.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.800]   And then, oh, pull it down, pull it down.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.320]   Dwight had a very good theory, I thought,
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.240]   in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.840]   And in fact, I asked him to come on.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.520]   He's going on a college tour with his daughter right now,
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.040]   so he can't.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.720]   But I'll speak for him.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.200]   I'll channel him.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.200]   And he said, this is Apple marketing.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.880]   Finally, Apple marketing says, whoa, dudes, our ad campaign--
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.200]   Yeah, I thought I think that's true.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.680]   Said, no viruses.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.120]   In fact, it was the very first switch campaign.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.280]   Remember, was a PC falling over with a bug.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.840]   You can't put-- they said, what are you doing?
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.360]   You're ruining the message.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.200]   So here's the question.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.240]   If that's what happened, is that irresponsible of Apple
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.520]   to let the marketing team--
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.880]   It's not even-- I mean, it's totally irresponsible.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.320]   If you need a antivirus, and I guess you do.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.920]   Yeah, at this point, you should have one.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.440]   I mean, these people basically have zero protection.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.000]   And why?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   It doesn't hurt to have something like that running.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I mean, yeah, OK, it hurts the sales pitch
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.520]   that the Mac is less prone.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.240]   But they can still say it's less prone.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.040]   The total number of viruses on the Mac,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.400]   if you put them side by side with the piles of viruses
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.280]   that run on the PC, it's like it's a mountain and a mole
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:13.480]   hill.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.400]   It's unbelievable.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.560]   I should get wanted to read this in his best Patrick
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.440]   Neuten marketing.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.480]   Market in ease, but I'll do it for you.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.760]   Bill Evans, Apple spokesman, says,
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.680]   we have removed the Knowledge Base article
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.560]   because it was old and inaccurate.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.400]   The Mac is designed with built-in technologies
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.880]   that provide protection against malicious software
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.280]   and security threats right out of the box.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.200]   However, and then I think he probably
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.360]   hopes that that will be the soundbite because then he goes on.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.800]   However, this is the lawyer.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.160]   Now the lawyers are in it.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.880]   So you started with a tech guy saying
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.040]   the publishing the tech note.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.840]   Then the marketing guy said, what are you doing?
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.240]   Then the lawyers get in and they say, but you got to say this.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.200]   However, since no system could be 100% immune from every threat,
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.440]   running any virus software may have a traditional protection.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.240]   Yeah, right.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.000]   Some are simply required.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.240]   Exactly.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.560]   May cause bloating and death.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.440]   Sound effects include death, sausage fingers.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.880]   Oh, wow.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.000]   So I think it's just Apple got busted, basically, on this one.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.240]   I don't know why they didn't.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.680]   They should have just shut up.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.400]   Yeah, they should have just left it and left it alone.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.360]   Julio, do you think this was irresponsible of Apple to pull this?
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.880]   Well, I'll tell you, I'm a more of a Mac user than a Windows user
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.720]   and I've been using Macs without antivirus software for years.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.760]   But frankly, I'm starting to feel more exposed
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.800]   and vulnerable and because the visibility of the Mac platform
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.040]   is increasing in recent months.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.080]   And so I'm about to stick some antivirus software on there.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.480]   So I think the real question is, should Mac users be using antivirus
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.200]   software?
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.160]   I talked a lot of Mac users that say no, but I think the answer very
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.960]   surely should be absolutely.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.000]   The funny, the funny--
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.920]   Just run a scanner once in a while.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.280]   Well, the funny thing is none of these antivirus programs
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.360]   really do very much nor are they updated very often
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.720]   because there really isn't any--
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.680]   there's no real activity going on out there.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.880]   There are a few threats, none of them really in the wild.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.920]   There's a spyware issues that apparently are on the Mac
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.960]   coming from some websites.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.440]   That's my understanding.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.240]   And one of the things that gives me peace of mind about sometimes
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.320]   using the Mac online is if you get infected,
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.920]   it's mostly most times it's your fault.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.440]   You have to do something pretty stupid.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.720]   Yes, all of the exploits require you to--
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.240]   You have to click on some.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.640]   But I'm still surprised this hasn't been done.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.880]   Once in a while, something will come up--
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.400]   there was a classic one recently about you need to update
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.840]   your flash.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.320]   And it was--
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.240]   That's the coob face.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.200]   We'll talk about that a second.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.080]   Yeah, it pops up.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.640]   And then you stupidly hit yes instead of closing the box.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.760]   Now, it seems to me-- I don't understand why you can't remap
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.840]   one of these dialogue boxes.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.400]   So the X itself becomes the initialization button.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.200]   You could.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.560]   I know.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.880]   I haven't seen anyone do it, though.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.400]   Not that I'm giving people ideas.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.040]   Yes, you are.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.680]   Well, believe it's already been done.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.480]   I'll be surprised if that's--
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.840]   I don't know that it's been done.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.680]   I'll tell you what it is.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.560]   It's called clickjacking.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.800]   And you could easily change the default button,
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.840]   but it's worse than that.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.600]   Clickjacking, it takes advantage of a flaw in HTML
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   that allows you to essentially overlay an invisible button
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.320]   on top of a visible button.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.320]   Ah, I like that.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.240]   Yeah, it's very sneaky.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.960]   And it's being used quite widely now.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.360]   And in fact, I'm going to talk about a clickjacking exploit.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.800]   But it's-- you don't even know you're clicking the button.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.440]   So here's an example of how, as you as a fact,
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.160]   this happened to a bank.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.840]   We've talked about it on security now.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.440]   I think it was in.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.520]   How do you pronounce that?
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   In-g?
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.720]   In-g is in-g.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.760]   It's a Dutch bank.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.440]   I thought it was Chinese because of the--
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.960]   No, it's in the enemies.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   No, it's Dutch.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.720]   In-g?
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.240]   In-g?
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:51.740]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.360]   No, it's Vietnamese.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.400]   OK, anyway.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.280]   It's Dutch or Vietnamese.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:54.800]   It happened.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.240]   I think it happened to them.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.640]   Their login system to the online banking
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.600]   was so poorly designed that a bad guy was
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.040]   able to put out a web page if you had been logged
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.320]   into your in-account, put out a web page
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.000]   that you looked like you were clicking on download, whatever,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.560]   download the latest version of Madonna's album.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.720]   And in fact, what he's done is put on top of it
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.440]   invisibly the in-login.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.240]   Oh, nice.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.760]   So you click that button.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.960]   What happens, a JavaScript runs on his page
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.160]   that has now logged into your account.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.720]   And has any--
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.040]   I mean, he's got access to your account.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.400]   Has any changes sent to him?
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.200]   In fact, this was a Gmail exploit as well.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.080]   It's happened to a number of Gmail users.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.320]   Again, click-jacking.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.240]   You stay logged into Gmail.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.200]   You think you're just clicking on an innocuous button.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.280]   What in fact happens is a JavaScript runs in your Gmail
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.080]   account forwards all your Gmail mail
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.600]   to another box.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.040]   You still get in the mail, but it's also
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.280]   being forwarded to the bad guy who then goes to Dotsster
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.600]   or GoDaddy, whoever your registrar says,
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.440]   I want to reassign my web page to a Joe Hacker.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.160]   They send a confirmation to your Gmail.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.200]   He gets it before you do.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.040]   Right, right, right.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.400]   You give it the OK and the next thing you know
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.640]   is running on somebody else's server.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.160]   He's hijacking these guys' servers.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.240]   Wow.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:15.760]   Click-jacking.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.800]   Very, very, very creative.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   So JavaScript has become the new macrovirus in essence.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.280]   Absolutely.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:21.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.560]   The macrovirus is the cross-platform infections
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.240]   that happen through it.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.840]   Well, what's the fix for it?
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.760]   Well, the short-term-- first of all,
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.120]   ingh fixed it by changing their authentication logging
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.040]   into the page.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.480]   Google mail has not yet fixed this.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.480]   The real fix for the end users-- first of all,
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.400]   log out of every page.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.880]   You go to your bank.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.720]   Don't just close the window.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.480]   Explicitly log out.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   Right, you have to log out.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.360]   Same thing with Gmail.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   Well, I leave my Gmail account open, but you shouldn't.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:46.880]   I know.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.880]   Sometimes you can-- I always say, here's
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.160]   what I discovered that I logged into Google
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.280]   is because I like to get some stock quotes once in a while.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.520]   When I'm logged in--
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.960]   like, for example, if I could put any quote, just
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.320]   some symbols.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.880]   So I'll put the symbols in.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.560]   If I'm not logged into Gmail or Google,
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.920]   the first thing that comes up is the symbol, a little chart,
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.880]   and the whole thing.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.800]   If I'm logged in, it doesn't show up at all.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.240]   So as soon as I put a symbol in, I expect to get the little--
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.520]   It knows your account.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.480]   It knows it's you.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.560]   Yeah, but it doesn't know--
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.640]   but for some reason, I have-- this is--
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.320]   That's bizarre.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.520]   It should know more, not less.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.560]   Yes, it knows less.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.160]   It doesn't give me what I'm looking for,
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.360]   which I'm looking for the stock quote.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.280]   It doesn't give it to me.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.040]   It's down on this page someplace.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.880]   And so I say, what is-- oh, I'll blog in.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.840]   So I un-log, do the same search, boom, right at the top.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.600]   Perfect.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.880]   Did you know with a Google search,
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.400]   you can type what time is it in Tokyo?
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.600]   That's so cool.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.320]   There's a bunch of stuff like that.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.280]   They used to have a better search for phone numbers,
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.520]   but that seems to have gone by the wayside.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.600]   I used to be able to type in Leola Port, Healdsboro,
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.840]   or Healdsboro, Paluma, phone.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.560]   And it would-- no?
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.920]   And it would put a little things at the top of all the Leola
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.840]   ports in the area with the phone numbers.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.160]   Not mine, I hope.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.320]   Well, not it does do any anymore.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.200]   And goodness.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.680]   I can tell you why it stopped doing that.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.320]   Leola Port called up and said, what the hell are you doing?
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.120]   Get that phone number out there.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.360]   So anyway, that's click-checking.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.000]   And the long-term solution--
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.080]   or actually not long-term, but the best solution
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.840]   is to use Firefox and to put use no script on Firefox,
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.440]   and it'll block click-checking attempts.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.400]   But it gets a little annoying.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.240]   Yeah, and the other thing you can do with Gmail is just run
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.120]   via IMAP in your mail account.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.600]   Right.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.240]   Not even login at all.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.080]   Yep.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.200]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.280]   I want to talk about Kubeface.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:40.680]   What?
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.760]   Kubeface.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.560]   Huh.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.280]   Same to you.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:43.960]   Same to you.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   Hey, Kubeface.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   Two.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.560]   But right now, I want to mention Audible.com,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.320]   our great friends at Audible do the best.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.440]   I just love them.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.960]   The best books.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.800]   You know, I still say books on tape, isn't it funny?
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.320]   That hasn't been on tape in--
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.800]   Audible is never on tape.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.520]   They do the best.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.080]   Go ahead.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.360]   John, this is your opportunity.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.760]   Would you like a glass of wine, a little brie?
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.320]   Where did the wine go?
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.000]   Where did the wine go?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.160]   Colleen, can we have some wine for Mr. Devorek while I
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.280]   do the commercial?
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.200]   My wine now.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.680]   Here she comes.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.800]   She's running down the stairs.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.720]   She took us seriously.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.200]   This is like having a butler or something.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.240]   Oh, Colleen.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.280]   You're going to end up with it.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.760]   The Jesus is not stinky.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.880]   Jesus is not stinky enough, darling.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.280]   We need some more more Claret for Mr. Devorek.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.320]   Oh, yeah, here she comes.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.280]   Look at that.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:38.800]   There you go.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.920]   We're having-- we're having Leoville today.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.200]   Leoville is the wine.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.120]   We'll talk about that, too.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.320]   It's a very fine--
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.080]   showing it to a camera, not my camera.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.880]   There you go.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.400]   That's blurry.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.800]   Eeee.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.160]   OK, for those of you watching at home.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.680]   Audible.com/-- actually, we're going to do the 749 deal.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:06.640]   Audible.com/twit749.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.200]   Now, Audible, as I mentioned, is a great place for audio books.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.520]   We're going to give you this special Audible Gold deal.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.840]   Your first three Audible books, when you subscribe--
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.640]   we have a number of deals.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.880]   We'd like to try different ones, see which one you like best.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.960]   This one, instead of your first book free,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.400]   gives you your first three books at half off.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.120]   So really, it's like ending a book and a half if you do the math.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   So your first three audiobooks are 749 each, half off the regular price,
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.200]   749 a month for the first three months with an audio book
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.560]   of your choice every month.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.320]   It's a great way to try it.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.400]   Ease into audio books.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.280]   Give yourself time to listen at one book a month.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.840]   I am on the two book a month plan because I love audiobooks.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.920]   But to get this special deal, you go to audible.com/twit749.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.880]   I think I have to change this right here, just so you see the right one.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.320]   Twit749.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.320]   That sounds like a good deal.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.400]   I may take advantage of that.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.200]   Are you not an Audible listener yet, Blob?
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.560]   I'm not an Audible listener yet.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.760]   So that may be a good time.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.880]   You're the guy I'm aiming this ad at.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.680]   Exactly.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.040]   I really want everybody to try Audible.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.480]   Now, I admit you might listen to less of our podcasts because you're going to have
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.720]   great stuff to listen to on the way into work today.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.600]   That's all right.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.200]   That's OK.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:20.840]   I'll share.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.200]   I'll share you.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.160]   I was listening to a great-- I love Neil Gaiman.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.320]   But here's one that's on my next edge-- next to listen a book.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.000]   It's called The Pixar Touch, The Making of a Company.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.440]   It just came out from David A. Price.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.680]   It's The Pixar Story, just released about three or four days ago.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.960]   And I'm always on the lookout for great books about the tech industry, of how it works and
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.880]   so forth.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.040]   This sounds like a really good one.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   Read by David Drummond just came out.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.400]   The people often think of Pixar.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.320]   They think of Steve Jobs.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.720]   No.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.800]   A lot of credit goes to Ed Catmull, the guy who founded it.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:05.680]   He was inspired by Disney, but a computer science guy who worked at Lucasfilm during
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.320]   the first Star Wars trilogy.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:15.480]   He got an investor named Steve Jobs to help him out, but created an amazing company called
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   Pixar.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.120]   He also talks about John Lasseter, who is a local boy here in the Northern California
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.120]   Sonoma County.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.360]   John does it makes wine as well.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.080]   Yeah, I got to visit him, please.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.520]   Yeah, John's a great guy.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.520]   Really talented.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.760]   I want to know about Pixar, the company that brought you Toy Story and so many great, great
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.000]   movies.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.560]   I love listening to Audible books, and this is a great way to do it.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.200]   The Pixar Touch, the making of a company.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.680]   This could be yours for half price.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.560]   In fact, this and three more, or two more for 749 each.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.320]   Go to audible.com/twit749.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.480]   We thank you so much for their support for this week in tech.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   Thank you, Audible.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.640]   So make a coop face.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.680]   That's my coop face.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.680]   Actually it's a Facebook virus.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.440]   As long as we're talking about security that is making the rounds, have you?
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.560]   I know I have a lot of Facebook friends, so I've gotten this three or four times.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:15.320]   You'll get an email, a Facebook message, or I get it on my wall from somebody that you
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.880]   know saying, "Hey, here's a great video."
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:23.240]   Usually, it's got a very clever subject lying like, "Your face was so good."
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.680]   You're so ready when you were dancing the other night.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.680]   I got video of it.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.680]   Click here.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.560]   You click that link and you get exactly what you're talking about.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.000]   "Oh, you need to upgrade your flash."
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.360]   And you say, "Oh, well, I probably do because that new flash just came out."
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.480]   So you upgrade your flash.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.840]   And of course, it's not a flash upgrade.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.800]   It says flash_player or flash_upgrade.exe.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.160]   And it puts you on a botnet and big botnet.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.360]   And you are now at the mercy.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.440]   "What is thy will, O my master?"
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.640]   At the mercy of the bad guy.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.320]   And this is all over Facebook.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.280]   Facebook's only response right at this point is, "Get an antivirus, scan your system, and
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.480]   then change your password."
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.080]   Because basically, your password has been compromised.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.960]   And anybody in your Facebook address book will be targeted by this thing.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.720]   Did they say in here this thing was Windows only?
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   The flash.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720]   It is.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.720]   It's an EXE.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   Okay.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   Don't fear the reaper.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.160]   But that can easily be done on the Mac.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.640]   I mean, you can tell them that that was a good idea.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.880]   It's always been my question.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.840]   Yeah, why aren't these viruses being written for Macintoshes?
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.280]   I guess it's just not big enough market share.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   Although Mac market share is now up almost to 10% according to the latest numbers.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:39.360]   And that gets back to my earlier point with Mac market share on the rise.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:46.800]   It's only a matter of time before it crosses a threshold, a line, and all heck breaks loose.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.640]   So that's why Mac user, I'm just, you know, as time goes on, I just get more and more
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.640]   nervous.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.080]   Net applications, which is a firm that watches, this is actually a really good way to see
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:02.280]   what real market share is because they essentially look at logs to see, you know, who's using
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.160]   what browser?
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.720]   The November results are out.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:14.600]   So significant gains, not only among Safari users, but just Mac in general and even iPhone.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.800]   Safari is 7% of browser market share.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.480]   That's of course Mac and Windows.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.120]   So that doesn't, you know, I imagine it's mostly Mac, but that could be Windows.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:29.520]   IE, of course, losing ground, it's now below 70% for the first time in years.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:38.960]   And in terms of operating systems, the Mac is now 8.87%, nearly 9% of market share.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.240]   And the iPhone is 0.37%, which is a big jump.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   I wonder why some of--
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.160]   It's a new gateway drug.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   The iPhone is--
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   Watch this.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:54.600]   Why somebody hasn't revived the destructive virus?
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.520]   You mean like the old days where they would go on six.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   The old days.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.320]   And then it raised your hard disk.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.120]   No, now they just get you into a bot net.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.080]   Because they make a lot more money then.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.320]   Yeah, but I mean, I still think they're used to be done as a kind of a game and they
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   weren't out to make money.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.720]   And I'm sure there's still those types of personalities out there and I haven't seen
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   one of these.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:19.600]   They get hired by the Russian mob and they're writing things they'll get you into bot net.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.040]   A big bot net was just discovered.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.800]   Several hundred thousand machines.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.360]   You know what a bot net is, right?
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.040]   Why don't you explain what a bot net is to her?
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   A bot net is an army of people who are not smart enough to protect their nom.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.840]   You're exactly right.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.720]   A bot net is just a series of computers who've been compromised and they're at the will
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.800]   of some somebody's command.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.200]   So someone can be sitting there underground basement in their mother's house, wherever
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.880]   and hit a button and BAM.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.720]   Attack your site with hundreds of these drones.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.760]   And the sad part is that people who are compromised don't even know it.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.200]   Well, you know, there's a couple of things.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:04.520]   One of them is the bot nets are mostly used for spam.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.400]   They set up giant spam networks.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.240]   They're not used as so much for DNS attacks.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:14.200]   And so you know, a lot of people essentially at all during the night, they will be sending
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   out spam unknowingly.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   Yeah, you don't know.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   Because that's the whole point.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.160]   They don't want to erase your hard drive because they don't want to live there.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:27.040]   Now the other thing that the latest type of my Comcast router blew up like a few months
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.840]   back in the game, he gave me a new one, which is an RCA.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.640]   But what's cool about it is got a button and you can turn off the connection.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   I think that's cool.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.360]   I think that, oh, it's an off button.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   It's an off button.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   So I can turn off the modem at night.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   That's a good idea.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.600]   And I just do it anyway because I don't want to see.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   Why not?
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.600]   Yeah, why not?
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.600]   What do I need to think running all night for?
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.840]   I'll tell you why not because there are those people out there who will think, okay,
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   I'm protected now.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.200]   I don't have to worry anymore.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   I've got the button.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.800]   Well, most of the time the action takes place at night anyway when your when your comp from
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:01.400]   already compromised machine goes to work and trend micro has discovered a worm.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:08.340]   They call it down at dot a Microsoft calls it conficker dot a and semantic calls it
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.720]   down a dump dot a.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.880]   This is part of the problem, by the way.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   Yeah, no, that is.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.760]   It makes it look like there's three new viruses.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.760]   It's the same one.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.760]   And what is because Spursky calls it something else?
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.600]   I'm sure they do something Russian.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.560]   It is it is one of the largest botnets they've ever seen with half.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.600]   They believe half a million infected computers.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.320]   So these are all logged into an IRC session and you're right.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.800]   They could be used for spam, but they're also used to to a blackmail, you know, betting
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.040]   sites, things like that.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.180]   Microsoft warned that the worm was behind a spike in exploits of a bug in the Windows
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.260]   server service, which is used by the operating system to connect to network and file print
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.260]   service.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.820]   So that's another use is you've got a you've got this army of bots.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.700]   Now you can use it to infect other computers and build your army.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.860]   That's when Microsoft put out a patch.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.160]   By the way, they're going to be eight critical fixes on Tuesday.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:01.240]   This is another patch Tuesday coming up the day after you hear this.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:07.260]   According to a trend micro, of course, these guys, you know, have some vested interest
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.260]   in you being terrified.
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.920]   They like it a little bit.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   That's a little bit.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.160]   But you know, doesn't mean it's not true.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.640]   It's just, you know, we should point that out.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.800]   This has real potential to do damage.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   They say it.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   They've spotted infected addresses on the networks of ISPs in the US, China, India,
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.320]   the Middle East, Europe and Latin America.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.320]   Now here's the thing.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.720]   It's amazing.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:32.280]   It just began spreading right before Thanksgiving and already half a million computers on this
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   net.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:39.880]   What was the spreading mechanism that Microsoft exploit that was just patched in October?
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.120]   It's a Windows.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.880]   It affects all flavors of Windows.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.280]   I mean, everything.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.000]   There is an expertise back to everything.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.160]   How does it get on your machine is the question I'm asking.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:54.400]   Well, it's using a remote procedure call service that I think is normally used for printers.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.400]   It's a worm.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.400]   They're worm.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.120]   They're going through this exploit and they're executing this remote code and they're infecting
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.120]   these guys.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.920]   So that's really scary because it doesn't, you don't have to be a dumb user to get this.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   You just don't get it.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.680]   You just be on the net unprotected, no firewall and you'll be infected in a matter of minutes,
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.680]   I think.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.680]   Oh man.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.200]   So this kind of follows right after McCullough was closed down.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.520]   We talked about this a couple of weeks ago.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:24.920]   McCullough was the company in San Jose that was, it turned out spreading 70% of all spam.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.240]   It was going from this one company.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:32.960]   Well, once again, Washington Post, kudos to the post, kind of discovered this.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.920]   And it wasn't the cops that busted them.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.440]   It was the post.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.640]   And then I think it was global crossing there.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.720]   And McCullough's upstream internet service provider pulled the plug on them all of a sudden
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:48.520]   in one hour, 70% drop in spam.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.200]   So I think this is what happened is that the crooks, when that happens, you know, quick,
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:57.720]   computers of market for, we got to get, we got to find a new host, put out a worm.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.120]   Put out a worm emergency emergency.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.600]   We need a worm emergency worm.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:09.360]   So you can tell when a computer is infected, when it's on the botnet.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.800]   So the security, the security teams are actually sending lists of infected PCs to their ISPs.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.760]   You may, you know, if you have one of them, you may get contacted by the ISP.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.600]   I doubt it.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.640]   Yeah, you know, you know, I can't see an ISP.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.720]   Have you ever, anybody ever any show a hands chatroom?
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.480]   Anybody ever get a letter from the ISP saying, I think you got a bug, dude.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.600]   No, more like, I think you owe us a bug, dude.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:39.760]   We had an infected machine dump at Port Angeles that was sending out just unbelievable months
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.240]   of crap.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.720]   And so I go up there and I'm, and it was, it was, the machine was acting up.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.760]   It was like so busy sending out spam.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.520]   I've got a hold of the ISP in this so they can monitor the packet activity.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.680]   I'm looking right now and not a single person and hundreds in our chatroom are responding.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.720]   We got 500 people in the chatroom and they said nobody, everybody says never.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.720]   Right.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.760]   You have to, but if you call them, they'll help you.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.640]   And so anyway, once they said that, I said, oh, and then I ran a scanner and found some,
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:10.440]   some, something on there that who knows who in the family got it on there, but got rid
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.440]   of it.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:16.400]   Here's a guy in Canada who says Rogers, his Canadian internet service provider, did contact
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   him.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.400]   The Canadians are nice that way.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.160]   Well, to kind of money their pain.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.360]   You ought to get something out of that.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.840]   But why we're on this security topic?
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.240]   One of the things that I'm going to try to do is, you know, my family calls me for tech
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.480]   support, which they do.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.200]   If they complain about the computers slowing down for no reason.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.160]   Yeah, that's all, all of a sudden it was slow.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.520]   That's a red flag right there.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.520]   Totally.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.280]   Because I mean, that's like the only way you can tell now, because a lot of these scanners
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.560]   don't even detect these things.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.040]   So if it just slows down, you know, it's like time to grab my medical bag and take a drive
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.240]   and try to get this thing.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.560]   There's a couple of things I like to recommend people do.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:03.800]   One is have at least running AVG free free dot grease soft.com for the virus protection.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:09.000]   And then there's a number, any number of spyware programs you need to run, probably
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.920]   two of them because they're none of them are perfect.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:19.800]   And then, you know, I've been using system mechanic, which actually works quite nicely.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.960]   Who makes that Iola?
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.960]   Really?
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.120]   Have you guys tried the latest version of the semantic suite because they're, I don't
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   refuse to use semantic stuff.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.240]   I heard the drugs up my system with all kinds of crap.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.240]   I heard they turn a new leaf.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:37.480]   I heard they fixed all the all the suckage and essentially.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.160]   Well, well, I don't know first and it's possible.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.640]   But you know, the problem is you lose a customer like me and it's like, it's always harder
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   to get a customer back.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.640]   All right.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:52.320]   I'm going to read you an email I just got from the vice president of consumer product
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.480]   management at semantic corporation.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:59.640]   I lead a product management for Norton and I've cringed in recent years as you've stomped
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   on our box.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.640]   I actually did.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   I literally stomped on the box.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.640]   You did?
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:08.040]   He stomped on the call for help in Canada and shared your frustrations with the project.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.520]   We've heard you and we've heard similar frustrations from some of our customers about the performance
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   impacted Norton.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.520]   That's chiefly what I don't like about Norton.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.520]   Norton.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.320]   So a year and a half ago, we took a hard look at our development process to determine how
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:24.760]   we could maintain great protection and also deliver the industry's fastest and lightest
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   security solution.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:31.640]   We set a goal of zero impact performance and he believes they've done it with the 2009.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.320]   He's asked, he's asked me to review what I will.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.040]   I don't have the lab.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.000]   You know what you really need is a lab with multiple computers and you can put it on
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   and see and benchmark.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Right.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.280]   You've got to do some blind studies and whatever.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:50.320]   What's very hard to test, and a lot of antivirus companies, I think with some justification
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:55.600]   complain about sites like Virus Bulletin that say, "We've got a suite of viruses.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.440]   We've collected these viruses and we test against them."
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:05.240]   I think they complain, they say, "It's a synthetic test and you can build your antivirus to score
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.800]   well on this test, but it doesn't mean it's a good antivirus."
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.360]   I think that's a legitimate complaint.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.080]   It's very hard to test antiviruses.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.960]   You can test their impact on your system.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:19.440]   Then I could do, but much harder to test whether it's effective antivirus, I think.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:26.440]   I did write a brief story about the latest Norton and its impact on the systems that
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.080]   I was running on.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:35.400]   Its footprint is very, very, it didn't suck resources very much at all, but it's still
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.680]   a dilemma because readers ask me about this.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.920]   Should I pay money for this stuff?
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:50.600]   I'd minimum like, just as John just said, at minimum, run the AVG free and Windows Defender
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.500]   is free.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.360]   You're pretty well protected with the free stuff, but the stuff that you pay for is starting
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.680]   to look a little better because it doesn't suck your resources.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.000]   Well, and don't be such a cheapskate.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   What does it cost?
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   30, 40 bucks.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   It's not a year.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   You think it's a lot?
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.200]   Too much given that.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.000]   Are the free products as good as they're paid products?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.680]   You can talk to a lot of different people.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.520]   A lot of people feel that the free products are easily as good.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   They're slower.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.400]   Yeah, but you slow, but I care.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.960]   What you do is you set it up to do a scan at four in the morning or you do it when you
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   feel like it.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.080]   I only scan, I don't have the thing running all the time, even though I do have one of
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.600]   the little monitors running.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.920]   It doesn't seem to get in the way of anything.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.920]   I guess, yeah.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.120]   The thing that's been mentioned in the chat room, I don't know if we've mentioned, but
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.040]   not 32 is also a great one.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:43.440]   Well, yeah, they're an advertiser on the radio show and I've been using it for years.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.320]   We set ESET not 32.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.320]   We never tried it.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   It's very lightweight.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.120]   All our tests were always, it was very lightweight and very fast, very effective.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.720]   Let me be blunt though.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.880]   The reason you don't get a virus, John, is because you're smart enough not to do the
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.080]   things like download the new flash player when you get that message.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.720]   That's really the issue.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.240]   And if you're that, if you're, I don't want to say dumb because it's not dumb, but if
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.520]   you're ignorant, naive, naive, ignorant.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.960]   No, nothing is going to protect you.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.560]   You can have every software program on there.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.160]   And if you're going around saying, I'll download that, I'll install that, no problem.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.440]   You're going to get bit, aren't you?
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.040]   I don't care how good your antiviruses.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.840]   So really, I think it's almost a case of people who know what they're doing, don't
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.120]   need an antivirus at all.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:34.080]   A lot of people like Bill McCrone, he never has one installed.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.360]   And the people who need an antivirus, it's not going to protect them because really what
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   they need is an education.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.680]   At least that's what I'm telling you.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.160]   I wrote a column one saying that people should get a license.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.400]   You have to have a license to be a computer user.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   This is in the days when you're actually trying to get, oh, hate mail.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.720]   You must be licensed to use the computer.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.320]   I agree with that, actually.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:00.280]   There's a famous, one of those stupid tech support stories where a woman calls up and
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.920]   tells the story about the computer.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.560]   And it's one of those like, I moved the mouse on the screen, but nothing happened.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.360]   And the guy says, oh, do you have the box that came in?
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.120]   She said, yeah, I should hear.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   This is what you need to do.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.240]   I'm going to take, unplug the computer, put it in the box, seal up the box, ship it back
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.240]   to us.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   You're too stupid to own a computer.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.600]   But the two main sources.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.600]   Yeah, that'll work.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:31.440]   I think the two main sources of viruses are number one, pornography and number two, limewire
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.320]   and period of period networks.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:38.720]   Those two, I think they account for a large piece of the pie where these things bond from.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:42.120]   So basically, these people are having sex with hookers and complaining that they get
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.120]   a disease.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.120]   Yeah, I guess you could put it that way.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.880]   Yeah, I wasn't thinking that.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.200]   But basically they're doing unsafe computing.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.280]   And then they complain because they didn't wear a condom.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.560]   So I don't have as much sympathy.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.040]   A lot of people are doing that.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.320]   Yeah, the thing is I know people like this.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.880]   They don't know what's dangerous?
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.880]   They're clueless.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.040]   And they're always on these porn sites.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:12.880]   They're floating around here in their phony baloney chat rooms and whatever.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:18.200]   There's a million of these crazy sites that look like they're all mobbed up.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.040]   And then they loaded with their machines, loaded with virus, and they're moaning about
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   it.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   And then people have their machines.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.560]   They won't even, you can't even boot the machine.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.160]   It's so messed up.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.560]   You've heard that one, right?
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.440]   Everyone else says, "I can't get the machine won't boot now."
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.440]   It's such a mess.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.560]   It takes hours to boot.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.800]   Literally hours.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.880]   You know what cracks me up is those are the people who say, "Okay, I'm just going to go
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.400]   buy a new computer."
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.120]   That's their response to it is, "Okay, well, I'll just buy a new computer."
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.560]   Yeah, and then they just mess up the next one.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.040]   Yeah, it's like they throw it out because it's got, "Oh, it's got, it's a mess.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.000]   I'm throwing it out."
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.400]   Well, you guys will probably be in front of me, but when my computer starts acting up,
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.280]   you know, when it starts acting slow and, you know, there's the slim possibility that
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.720]   I'm infected, I usually just wipe the damn thing.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.640]   No, no, I'm not laughing at you.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.960]   That's exactly the thing to do.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.960]   Because it all makes the way away.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.560]   But to wipe out the whole machine?
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.560]   Why?
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.920]   Well, just take and tweak out with the problem.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.480]   It's not that hard to do.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:25.080]   Well, see, John, by all my information, everything of value in terms of information is already
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.080]   in the cloud.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.800]   So I can just nuke a computer without thinking about it.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:35.160]   Best thing to do is you have an image of your system that's known good.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.840]   And you just, frankly, once you get a bug, you're screwed.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.960]   There's no way you could figure out how to get rid of that.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:42.960]   No, bull.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.960]   No, because I'm not a Mac too long.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.840]   No, I'm no, no, no, because what happens is you, let's say you get this virus that we're
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.200]   just talking about this botnet.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   What's the first thing it does?
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.240]   It gets, attaches the botnet and then it puts a bunch of other stuff on your system.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.240]   Sure.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.360]   There's no way that you can know you don't have anything on your system.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.360]   There's root kits.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.560]   There's all sorts of ways to hide this stuff.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.920]   You cannot with certainty clean a system.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.720]   That's old time thinking.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.720]   That's the old days.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.400]   That's the old days you could do that.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.400]   Not anymore.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.200]   Nowadays, you just got to, the best thing to do is make sure you've got good backups, have
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.560]   an image that's known good or use it for, use your disk.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.160]   I think it's better to do an image because you can have all the updates on it.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.680]   In this blast, not on 10 minutes later, you're back to, you're back good to go.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.680]   Exactly.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   You just lost all your porn.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.240]   I like to freshen it every few weeks anyway.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.520]   You know, I say all the same, all we got to constant change is the best.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.960]   We're going to take a break, talk about the biggest story of the week.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.120]   We haven't even mentioned biggest story of the week.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.120]   Huge.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.280]   You brought down the site where they, where they published this story.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.280]   It was such a big story.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.400]   We'll talk about what it is in just a bit.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.400]   Here's a tease for you.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.200]   It's also kind of an ironic tease as you'll learn.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.160]   But right now I want to talk about our sponsor.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.760]   Go to my PC.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.200]   John, would you like to see?
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.480]   You don't have any, any roast to baste or anything.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.920]   So you can't, but you want to take a walk, you can.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   We'll be back in five minutes.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   You're, you're indulgent.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.680]   I'll be back in a few minutes.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.560]   Go to my PC is that have some cheese, have some bread.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.040]   You took off the mic so you don't have to listen to him chew.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.040]   Go to my PC. That's a great product from the folks at Citrix.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.280]   They really invented remote access back in the early days before Microsoft often offered
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.480]   remote and plain little secret.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.560]   They wrote the Microsoft stuff before they offered remote desktop.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.840]   Citrix was there.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:34.600]   They make the best that I got to call this morning from a Marjorie handle.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.400]   She is the wife of Bill Handel, the morning man in LA, number one morning man in LA.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.760]   They're going to Israel.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.680]   She said, I am, I want to be able to access my PC.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   I'm going to take a lot of pictures.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   I want to access my PC.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.880]   We're going to be in Israel, but I'm going to bring a Mac.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.880]   Can I do that?
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.480]   And I said, absolutely, absolutely you go right now.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.840]   I told her go right now to go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:59.240]   And within a couple of minutes, you're going to have it installed on your PC.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.080]   Before you leave, just make sure it's all working.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.400]   Log in with your Mac.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.960]   You'll see it anywhere you can get online and airport a hotel.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:12.880]   You know, the reds from the Red Sea to Tel Aviv to Haifa, you'll be able to go in.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   Log in.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.680]   You'll see your PC right there full screen.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.840]   You'll be able to do anything you could do if you were there.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.640]   Send and receive email, access any network resource, run any program, just like you're
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   there.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.640]   But here's the beauty.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.360]   Even if you're at an insecure access spot, you know, a hotspot at a coffee shop, you've
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.960]   got 128-bit encrypted access to your PC.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.520]   You're completely safe.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.040]   You're going to go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:42.320]   Find out why PC World gave it their world-class award for Best Remote Access software.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.320]   It's easiest to use.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   It's the simplest.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.200]   It goes right through routers, no issues with configuration.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.800]   I have my mom using it.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.720]   Everybody I know uses it because if they want support for me, they've got to be running
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   go to my PC.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.720]   And then it's easy.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   I'll fix it.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:02.160]   30 days free right now, a month free, get you right through to 2009, go to go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.040]   Thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.040]   Great stuff.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.320]   Biggest story of the week.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.600]   You guys know what it is?
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   Big.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.800]   Obama carries...
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   You knew it.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.800]   Who do you know?
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.000]   Obama carries a Zoom or does he?
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Well, that's the question.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   Or does he?
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.040]   Put on your microphone, John.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.280]   So that's the question.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.000]   And when this story came out...
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   Obama squirts.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Huh?
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   Obama squirts.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   Obama squirts now.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   I don't know.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   What was that?
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.080]   I turned for the Zoom to share a song.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.080]   It's a squirt.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.240]   That's what Obama calls it.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.000]   He says, "You're listening to some music.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.600]   A good looking girl comes up and you say, 'Hey, let me squirt my music up for you soon.'
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.760]   And then you squirt your soul with your baby.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.920]   It really comes up with this stuff.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   And it's so...
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.920]   Obama!
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.080]   I think Obama's got to rethink his...
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.080]   Yeah, it's not a good...
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.080]   ...swargating strategy.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.040]   In fact, even Steve Jobs when...
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.520]   When Obama said that very famously said, "Ah, ew."
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.080]   That sounds right.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.520]   But then he said, "But no, see, here's what you do.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:04.640]   Yeah, we don't have that capability in an iPod, but it's much sexier to share your
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.640]   headphone."
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.680]   So you take one earbud out and you say, "Here, listen to what I'm doing."
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.440]   "Here, let me infect your ear."
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.440]   That's sexy.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.440]   That's sexy.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.440]   Oh, God.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.440]   Sexy.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.440]   Sexy.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.240]   So it was a...
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.240]   The Philadelphia newspaper...
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.440]   I'm not buying it, by the way.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.960]   Well, let's talk about it.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:31.520]   The CityPaper.net, published an article about Obama working out to the gym and blah blah.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:35.400]   It was very innocuous piece, except four graphs down.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:41.240]   They mention, the fourth paragraph, that he looked like he had a Zoom.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.320]   Well, he either looked like he had one or...
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   One of the other...
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.320]   Maybe it'll look like he had one.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.280]   Maybe he could have been an iPod in one of those cases.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.280]   It doesn't matter.
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.880]   It doesn't matter because it got picked up.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.880]   It was dug.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.880]   It was...
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.880]   Tech Blogger picked it up.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.040]   The site, CityPaper.net, was down.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.560]   I mean, they got hit hard.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.760]   Everybody wants to see Obama.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:58.760]   Like that's the story.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   There's...
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.640]   It's Obama carrying a Zoom.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   And then...
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   You know what this would...
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.640]   If it could be proven he uses a Zoom, it would...
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.840]   The sales would skyrocket.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.840]   Yeah, it would.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   Well, he'd be the only one.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.960]   Huge story.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:13.960]   So it turns out...
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.560]   Okay, so then, believe it or not...
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.400]   My son uses a Zoom, by the way.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   Does he?
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   Why?
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   Poor kid.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   That's all you would buy him?
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   I would buy him.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   I refuse to follow with the rest of the other.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   I forgot to shoot.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.400]   Have you played with the storm?
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   You want to play with it?
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   So...
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.400]   Actually, I have a Zoom here somewhere too.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.400]   I have a Zoom.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.400]   I like...
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   I don't hate the Zoom.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   No, you actually like the Zoom.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.400]   There's nothing wrong with a Zoom.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.400]   It's just not an iPod, you know, so it's...
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.400]   Does this thing have a hidden keyboard?
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.400]   No.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   The keyboard...
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.400]   Joggyo.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   It sounds like a keyboard.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   Well, he's playing with the...
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   He's playing with the touch.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   He's playing with the touch.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   Pretty low on it.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   I mean, the...
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.960]   It's a nice unit, a little heavy.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.960]   It does...
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   It's pretty, isn't it?
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.960]   Yeah, it's very pretty.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:56.960]   But there's no keyboard.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.960]   You have to use a crappy...
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:58.960]   Have you...
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   Have you used...
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.960]   Bonneur...
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   Have you used the...
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:02.960]   The storm?
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:04.960]   I've actually...
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:05.960]   I have the...
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:06.960]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.960]   No, he said he hasn't.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.960]   No, he said he hasn't.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.960]   I have all three blackberries right here right now.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.760]   I have the flip style blackberry.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:17.000]   I have the touchscreen storm blackberry and I have the bowl, the AT&T bowl.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.760]   Which do you like the best?
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:27.320]   And quite frankly, you know, blackberry is best when it sticks to what it does.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:33.040]   The physical keyboard on the bowl is just amazing.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.720]   And I just love the thing to death.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.480]   It's a traditional blackberry.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:41.640]   It's not trying anything new, but it's just so wonderful to use.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:48.680]   Physically because the touch screen keyboard on the iPhone drives me nuts and the storm
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.280]   iteration is just simply awful.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.360]   I just can't stand it.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.200]   I don't hate the storm, but I'm totally with you on that, Julio.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   I think the...
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   The bold is the right one.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.440]   It's a beautiful screen.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.440]   The bold.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.440]   That's the one.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.440]   They stuck with their keyboard.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.040]   They're trying to compete with the iPhone with the storm.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.880]   And you know, it's got a moving screen.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.880]   So you'll see...
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   I like it.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   No, I like it.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.880]   I like the storm.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.880]   It's kind of weird.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.880]   You touch it.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:12.880]   It is weird.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:13.880]   You have to push it enough to move the screen.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.880]   And it's the same when you type.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:15.880]   It's a little hard to touch.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.880]   I think it's...
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.880]   I agree with you, Julio.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.360]   I think the iPhone touch screen, but the iPhone touch screen is better.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   That's what I use.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.560]   Because I like it because it's light but it has heft.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.000]   Oh, you have the new Nokia.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   Is this the E-72 or the 71?
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   71.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   That is nice.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   That is a...
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   You know what I want though.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   And you can type fast on it.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.200]   They just announced the 97.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   That.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.200]   Yeah, but it seems to be...
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.200]   I think it's too big.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.720]   I want something that's thin like this.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.320]   This is really, really nice.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.320]   I don't want to show any...
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.520]   Good, I'm not going to show anything.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:48.480]   It looks like a bold but it's very thin, bold style keyboard.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.480]   I have the E-61.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.320]   It kind of looks like a revision of that.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.320]   Yeah, this is smaller than the 61.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.160]   And it's got a really nice feel to it.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.400]   It has a nice heft without being heavy.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.680]   And it's got a weird kind of etched backing that actually has a grip to it.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.520]   So it actually doesn't slip on your hands.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.520]   You know what it feels like?
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.680]   A fine Dunhill lighter.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:09.680]   Exactly.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.720]   It's like a cigarette lighter.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.760]   It feels like a fine, sturdy silver light.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.560]   That's fine back there.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.120]   Bond, James Bond.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.400]   I like your cigarette money penny.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:26.720]   And the bold has the leather like back which also I find very, very elegant and pleasing
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   to the touch.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:28.720]   I'm...
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.720]   Noke of course announced the...
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:32.080]   And we'll get back to the Zoom story in a second.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.720]   But Noke announced the...
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.200]   Who are you calling?
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.440]   I'm just letting it ring into the mic.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.440]   Can you hear it?
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.440]   You know what the storm has a really good loud stereo speakers which is kind of nice.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.120]   I can't figure out how to handle that.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   I'm surprised.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   You're the burner guy.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.120]   But you know what?
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.760]   You have the most elegant phone in the crowd here.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.720]   I am a burner guy.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.720]   This is really nice.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.720]   USB connector.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:54.720]   The charges.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.720]   How?
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.720]   Fry a USB?
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:00.480]   No, it's got that same classic Nokia, the new small Nokia pin.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.480]   Okay.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.480]   I wish they wouldn't do that.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.480]   Ah, it's at the bottom.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.480]   I wish they wouldn't do that.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.480]   No, you could...
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   I think it's still...
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.480]   I think it will charge with a USB.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:12.080]   I like USB charging because then you don't have to bring a bunch of cables with it.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.120]   Oh, this thing is the smallest...
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.120]   It's beautiful.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.040]   I'm talking about the charger thing.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.120]   It's like unbelievably...
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.120]   This is elegant.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:21.120]   I can't wait to see the N97.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:26.160]   They introduced it in Barcelona this week and all of the pictures and so forth.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.240]   It looks really gorgeous.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.240]   It's a tilt.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:34.280]   It has a full-sized keyboard tilt up screen, 5 megapixel camera.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   It looks pretty nice.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.560]   I have to say now, this is E-72 or the 71.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:41.000]   It's got the number on the back.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   It says E-series.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.240]   I don't think you're...
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.160]   Every time I say it, I say the wrong number.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.800]   3.2 megapixels.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:52.640]   Does it support the HSDPA, the 3G stuff?
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.640]   I don't know.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.640]   Yeah, no, it does.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.640]   Totally, I took this thing to Europe.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:56.640]   Okay.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.640]   I had no problem there.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.640]   And Wi-Fi?
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.080]   Yeah, it's got Wi-Fi and it hooks to Wi-Fi really easy.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080]   I can hook to the Wi-Fi.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.960]   That's the one thing that was extremely disappointing about this storm, no Wi-Fi.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.960]   No, it's an E-71.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.240]   It says right there in the corner.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.240]   What's the problem with the Wi-Fi?
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:16.920]   It's got Wi-Fi and it's got 3G and it's got GPS in it too, with turn-by-turn.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.000]   How's the battery life?
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   It's battery life.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   This is like a typical Nokia.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   As long as you get all day, I don't care what I get.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   Oh, I get typical Nokia.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.520]   The N95 died after two hours.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.800]   Oh, this will go for about three days.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.960]   I'm afraid of what the N97's battery life's going to actually be.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.760]   When you turn on all those radios, that's when you start.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.400]   I'm ordering one of these.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.120]   Can you get them unlocked?
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.600]   That's unlocked.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.280]   I just put my T-Mobile chip in it.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.880]   Yeah, you can get them unlocked.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.160]   I like it.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.080]   What carrier do you use, AT&T?
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.880]   I'm using AT&T but we're switching to T-Mobile.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.600]   But I put a phony one in something from Europe and then...
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.320]   I would buy that right now.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320]   How much?
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.320]   How much?
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320]   I'll take it from you.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   You can go back to your burner.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320]   I know you want it.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320]   I know you want it.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   I don't want it.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.320]   I don't even know.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.320]   I don't even know.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.320]   I don't even know anything anymore.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.320]   I can actually play it for you if I find it here.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.320]   He said that we're going to get, you know, let me play it for you.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.320]   Let's finish the story.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:45.320]   It turns out that at the Democratic National Convention, they handed out zoons.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.320]   And so the thinking now, the thinking now.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.320]   Isn't that some form of corruption?
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320]   No, no, no.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.320]   It's like a gift bag.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:59.320]   The thinking now is that in fact...
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.320]   I'm calling this phone with my iPhone.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   Are you calling my phone with your phone and your phone with iPhone?
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.320]   I'm sorry for interrupting the show.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.320]   That's quite all right.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.320]   Okay.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]   That's again.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.320]   I'm about to give people time to drink.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320]   I just killed it.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.320]   Okay.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.320]   So they...
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   It's the whole building.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320]   So everybody got a free Zoom including Obama.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320]   Oh, sweeping out for it.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.320]   Or they don't think it was maybe Obama just asked an aid for it.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.320]   He's not going to get to keep his blackberry.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.320]   I doubt he'd get to keep his Zoom.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.320]   I think this is bogus by the way.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.320]   The blackberry thing?
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.320]   I think there's no reason in the world that they can't do something, run it through a proxy,
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.320]   or do something where it could be very secure.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.320]   If he's a blackberry nut...
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.320]   Let him use it.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.320]   Let him use it.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.320]   You know what it really is.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.320]   They don't want him playing Tetris in National Security Council meetings.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.320]   That's probably what it is.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   I actually interviewed last week Joe Hagen, who was Deputy Chief of Staff to President Bush
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.320]   until just a few months ago, had the office next to the Oval Office.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.320]   In fact, he said, he's told by White House historians that he's spent more time in the
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.320]   West Wing in the White House than any human alive.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.320]   Eighteen years, he served under President Bush the first and the second.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   And I asked him about that.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:11.320]   And he said, "President Bush, the current President Bush, gave up, as you know, gave up his email address
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.320]   when he got in the White House.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.320]   He had 42 friends.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.320]   He was G92W@aol.com.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.320]   And he gave up the email address, wrote a message to him saying, "I'm President.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   I can't send you an email."
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.320]   And he said, "It really is true.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   It's not merely security.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.320]   It's a Freedom of Information Act."
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.320]   He said, "What if--" Here's an example.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.320]   Somebody sends him an email.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.320]   It's totally inappropriate.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.320]   What does he got to do?
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.320]   Disavow that person now.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.320]   It becomes public knowledge.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.320]   What are you doing, Joe?
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.320]   Sorry, sorry.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.320]   What am I thinking?
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.320]   I gave him a toy.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.320]   I don't know why I gave him a toy.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.320]   He'll be playing Tetris in this black--
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.320]   Hey, Barry, what are you doing?
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.320]   Put down the black, Barry, Barry.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320]   Anyway, I'm proud of him.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   Here's what he said.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.320]   I'm trying to find the--
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.320]   You got voice dialing in this.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.320]   Most significant effort to modernize and upgrade school buildings that this country has ever seen.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.320]   This is his-- he's doing-- you know, he does his presence--
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   Weekly address.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320]   President-elect address now will be present.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.320]   Yeah, that's just--
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.320]   Because it's on YouTube.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.320]   Really, huh?
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.320]   What are you?
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.320]   He's just taking me on now.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   Listen to what he says here.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320]   This is good.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320]   We will repair broken schools.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   Make them energy efficient.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.320]   No, no, no, no.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.320]   Put new computers in our classrooms.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.320]   I thought the campaign was over.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.320]   Because to help our children compete in a 21st century--
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.320]   I know, he sounds like he's running, doesn't he?
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.320]   He has yet to not give a campaign speech.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320]   Listen.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   As we renew our schools and highways, we'll also renew our information super highway.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:41.320]   It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the world in broadband adoption.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.320]   It's unacceptable.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:46.320]   Now, see if you ever said that during the campaign I would have voted for.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.320]   Listen, listen.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:53.320]   In the country that invented the Internet, every child should have the chance to get online.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:59.320]   And they'll get that chance when I'm president because that's how we'll strengthen America's competitiveness in the world.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:07.320]   In addition to connecting our libraries and schools to the Internet, we must also ensure that our hospitals are connected to each other through the Internet.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:14.320]   So, I mean, this is certainly the most technologically sophisticated president we've ever had, just by his generation, if not by anything else.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   But he's saying something important here, and I think we need to make sure that he follows through on this universal Internet access.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.320]   And I think we do need that, Ms. Godfrey.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   I think it's happening already because the FCC is looking into taking a chunk of spectrum and giving everybody free.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.320]   Do you think that'll happen? Free Internet access?
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   I think it'll happen.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.320]   It's not going to be great access.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.320]   It doesn't have to be 300 kilobits.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:44.320]   That's what the concerns is Verizon hates it and Comcast hates it because they're afraid of losing their business.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.320]   Well, it's fine.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.320]   Well, give them 150 kilobits, give them 300 kilobits. You don't have to give them four megabits down.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.320]   Give them enough to get your email.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.320]   To get your email to get online is surfed in that not to download movies or whatever.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:59.320]   Give them a basic Internet service, but everybody should have it.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.320]   Yeah, because you might need it.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.320]   You might, you do.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.320]   Nowadays, if you want to participate in society, you need it.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.320]   Every, we'll see what happens.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   It's fine that you're on this bandwagon.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.320]   But Twitter and every pot of Facebook and every garage.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.320]   Yeah, you're just doing it because you're going to make more money.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.320]   Yeah, I want everybody to be able to download Twit.
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:20.320]   By the way, so you got this microphone here and you've got a pop filter in front of it.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320]   I do.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.320]   Because that thing pops like a champ if you don't have this.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320]   Oh, yeah. They claim to have a built-in pop filter on those.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320]   It doesn't work.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.320]   Hile PR40, that's the mic I use.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:35.320]   Now, what do you know, what can you tell people out there who are wanting to do or do a little podcasting once in a while, anything about these pop filters.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.320]   And why did you pick that one?
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.320]   Well, I had a big, first I had a big muff.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.320]   And that's- You had a what?
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.320]   Muffles it.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.320]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.320]   That was for your benefit.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.320]   And then I had a silk stocking stretched on a giant ring.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.320]   Which is the old classic.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.320]   And that's the best way.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.320]   Is it still?
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.320]   If you look at any picture of Axl Rose singing, and you don't have the big silk stocking thing.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   But the problem with that, for what we do, we do a lot of video.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.320]   You know, you couldn't see me.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.320]   I was like behind a big black screen.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.320]   Oh, that's why you had the small one.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.320]   That makes sense.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.320]   No, I got a little one.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.320]   Somebody sent it to me.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.320]   I don't know who.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.320]   I want to thank him, but I can't remember his name.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.320]   Thank you, Mass, man.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.320]   It's a good little-
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.320]   It's a little bit- It's about the size of the microphone.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.320]   It's metal, but it's pretty fine, Mess.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.320]   It does a good job.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.320]   And then you just- When you say pop bar, you say it out of the side of your mouth.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.320]   Sure.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.320]   Pop bar.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320]   Pop bar, the sailor man.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.320]   But that thing will pop on a B.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   And a Pops-G and everything else.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:34.320]   It's very- And because it's a dynamic, Mike, you got-
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.320]   It works out so much better if you work them close, but that's the problem is if you work them close to the Pops.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.320]   So you have to- Right.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.320]   Back off a little bit.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:44.320]   So the big story of the week is- Oh, no, we already did that.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.320]   Obama's Zoom.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   So we think it was a- It was a Zoom, but it was a Zoom from an aid.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320]   It was an aid's Zoom.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.320]   So don't worry, Obama does not carry a Zoom.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.320]   I think he should.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:59.320]   But I'll tell you one thing that really- It's a relatively small thing, but it's one thing that really impressed me about it.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:05.320]   The Obama campaign, did you guys play with the campaign's iPhone app?
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:07.320]   That was amazing.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.320]   It was amazing.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   You know, they could have put out an iPhone app that was kind of lame, but the thing just was tricked out.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.320]   And that little gesture really, really impressed me.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:23.320]   Well, I mean, there's just no question in my mind at all that he's got- You know, and I've talked to some of these people, very, very-
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:28.320]   Including Chris Hughes, the guy who started Facebook, he's Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.320]   He's got very smart people doing his technology.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:38.320]   They harvested, I don't know, how many millions of SMS messages when they said, "Hey, you want to know before the press does?
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:41.320]   We'll text you the vice president." And they've been very aggressive.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:47.320]   I have a feeling that iPhone application was similarly used to harvest phone numbers, right?
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.320]   Was he that techie when he was in Illinois?
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.320]   I don't know.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.320]   I don't think he's that techie.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:59.320]   I've wrote a column in Market Watch about this kind of questioning whether he's the great tech savior.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:03.320]   Just because somebody uses a BlackBerry and is addicted to it doesn't mean they're a tech nut.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   But he does recognize, obviously, how important it is.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   And I think he's- Since he went to the right guys to do his website and all these apps and everything,
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:17.320]   he has some amount of cognition regarding tech and how important it is.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.320]   But I don't think that, personally, that if you ask them about- You know, even though he's been grilled on some of these things,
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.320]   but he's been briefed.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:30.320]   You know, if you ask them, for example, what do you think of PHP? Does it have a future?
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.320]   To me, if you're a techie at all, you could answer that question.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:36.320]   Well, you remember when he talked at Google, who knows why, but when Eric Schmitz said-
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   Yeah, they threw him a softball that he'd been briefed on.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320]   He'd been briefed for.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:44.320]   They're saying in the stick-am chat that he did as a senator, he did a podcast.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.320]   So that's- Again, I don't-
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.320]   It doesn't mean anything, doesn't mean anything.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.320]   Who cares- Do you want a president who understands PHP? No.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.320]   I'm just saying.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   Jimmy Carter was a nuclear engineer. He still said nuclear. It didn't help.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.320]   Yeah, yeah, it was the rabbit that did it.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.320]   What's that crazed rabbit that attacked him in the rowboat? The nation lost confidence.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:13.320]   Yeah, John, you raised a good point. I mean, a politician doesn't necessarily need to know his or her way around technology.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:20.320]   I interviewed a Minnesota politician who shall remain nameless, and I was talking to her about the digital TV transition.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   And it became very quickly apparent to me that she didn't know what the heck was going on.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   She was talking about satellite, getting people to satellite.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:36.320]   But at the same time, her staff has shown great leadership in sort of pushing-
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.320]   Yeah, you get the right people working.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   You get the right people working for you, and you can get away with a lot.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.320]   I think that's the bottom line. He's got some really smart people working around him.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   That's really building. His campaign is like the template for future marketing companies.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   No, no question about it.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   That's ridiculous, honey.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   Well, not yet, but also the money.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   For fundraising.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   The problem is-
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:04.320]   Everybody now believes that all the future campaigns are going to be spending a billion dollars to get the guy even passed it.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:11.320]   That number is interesting, but in Canada, with a population of 30 million, they spend equivalent of almost $10.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:17.320]   They spent $300 million on the campaign. Now, per capita, you know-
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   They're still going to have the government overthrowing.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   They still have a crappy system going on now.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   No, now they're trying to figure out that it's very complicated.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.320]   It's a complicated thing there.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.320]   It's a parliamentary government, and now he's going to the governor general, and she's got to decide what to do.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.320]   You know, this is why you really shouldn't have a queen.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.320]   I'm not a monarchist.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.320]   In any event, they spend about $10 per person in Canada.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.320]   We only spend about $1.50 per person, including both campaigns.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:50.320]   So it isn't an outrageous amount of money given, especially how media-focused campaigns are.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.320]   You've got to buy a lot of ads.
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:59.320]   That number is wrong because if Obama took in and apparently spent close to $750 million-
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.320]   A billion and a half total-
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.320]   A billion and a half.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.320]   We got 350,000 total population.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.320]   $50 million.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.320]   So it was about $1.50 million.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.320]   No, no, it's not the right.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.320]   It's not right.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.320]   No.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.320]   All right.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.320]   Two bucks.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.320]   It's not 10 bucks.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:16.320]   No, no, it's not 10 bucks, but it's closer to- it's not a buck.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.320]   It was- We'll figure it out.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.320]   Oh, did the governor general already decide?
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.320]   What is she- is she going to rogue- they- it's like the some weird word, the rogue?
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.320]   She's got a rogue.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.320]   I think they stopped parliament or something.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.320]   She did it.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.320]   She decided to rogue- a rogue game?
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.320]   Rogueate?
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.320]   It's pro-rogued.
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.320]   She pro-rogued to the parliament.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.320]   We don't know what we're talking about, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.320]   Whoa!
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.320]   They pro-rogued the parliament.
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.320]   They cut down.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.320]   That's what Stephen Harper wanted.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   That's kind of a shock.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.320]   Well, he wanted that because all hell is breaking.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.320]   He stays in government.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.320]   He was getting screwed.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   But he was getting screwed.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.320]   His party won all the votes.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   I mean, how did- He was a coalition government.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.320]   He didn't have a- he had a plurality.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   He didn't have a majority.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.320]   Well, I still- he had more votes than he had before when he was the prime minister.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:55.600]   And, you know, getting less votes- I mean, getting more votes usually means you're going
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.600]   to stay in.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.320]   You don't get kicked out when you get more votes, not less.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.320]   Anyway, it's pretty funny.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.520]   Anyway, let's get out of politics because I know you guys hate it when we talk politics,
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.320]   but sometimes politics intersects with-
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.120]   Well, I guess there's another chance if you say Obama one more time, we'll have half
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.320]   these guys in the can.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.320]   But you know what?
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.520]   You know, Leo, I think what would make him a really tech president, I'm going to end
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.520]   on this.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.320]   If he had an LOL cat, I can't have Zova Lophis.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.320]   Exactly.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.320]   That'll do it.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.320]   And thanks to Outstanding for that one.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:33.040]   Well, one way I like to amuse myself is to get on the internet and look for sightings
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.400]   of Obama or Biden near Macintosh computers.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.320]   You can find those on a regular basis.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.320]   Oh, really?
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:43.040]   I call them Barack Mack and Biden book sightings.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.040]   Interesting.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.280]   I'm surprised there has a bit more conversation about what they prefer Windows or Mac.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.440]   I mean, it's a stupid conversation, but I'm just surprised how that happened.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.680]   It appears to be Mack.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.520]   Says Julio, who is the Mack man?
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.520]   Yes, I noticed.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.920]   It's always the vested interest.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.120]   I will stay a little political here with his Google story.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:10.000]   AT&T hired a guy named Scott Kleeland to write a paper for his anti net neutrality group,
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.520]   the net competition.org that says that Google uses 16.5% of all consumer internet traffic
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.200]   and yet pays only a fraction of that in bandwidth costs.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.200]   Why does AT&T care?
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.480]   Because they love to charge Google a little bit extra to access their customer.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.000]   This doesn't sound right.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.640]   It's not right.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:33.040]   The calculation was done by calculating foot traffic to YouTube, not the total bandwidth
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.280]   that YouTube uses, but merely the number of visits to the YouTube site, the number of
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.280]   videos displayed.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.400]   And of course, Google me is said, look it, you've got people downloading high def movies
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:44.400]   from Apple.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.040]   It's a smaller number, but it's a lot more bandwidth.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.160]   YouTube's crappy bandwidth.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:56.600]   On the other hand, YouTube just kind of contrary to this, started putting an HD video up.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.800]   If you posted an HD, in many cases, you'll get an HD link.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.240]   What would be the, because the limit used to be 100K, 100 meg.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.520]   You can now get a pro account.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.520]   You go bigger.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.520]   What does that cost?
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.520]   I don't know.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.520]   You don't think it's that expensive.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.280]   And so with the pro account, I can upload like more than the 100 meg's and put an HD
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280]   move up.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.280]   More than 10 minutes.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   It's a gig.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   A gig?
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.280]   Yep.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.280]   One gig.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.880]   I've been putting a couple of HD videos on YouTube.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.480]   You do a lot of videos, Bono.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.520]   And they're ranging between, I've been trying to compress them as much as I can, but they're
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:40.560]   ranging between 800 megabytes to a gig, you know, for like a five to eight minute video.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.560]   That's an HD.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.560]   An HD.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.440]   I do it in 720p and I can press it as much as I can without losing to it.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.600]   Well, these old Kodak cameras shoot an HD.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.600]   You know, like.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.400]   Yeah, that new flip competitor.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.240]   Well, that actually, the flip competitor is really nice because I think it is six
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240]   to 60 frames a second.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240]   Wow.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   720p.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.240]   I've got my mark two.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.240]   Yeah, well, that's the best.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.240]   Oh, but you know, that's.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.240]   Oh, I've used, I mean, the more video I see.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.480]   Yeah, I know some astonishing, but that's because the thing you're always going to, well, you
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.520]   won't because you got so much money, but generally speaking, what most people overlook
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.960]   is that that camera is only as good as those lenses.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.200]   And I have all the lenses already.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.200]   Oh, you do?
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.200]   You're already a canning.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.200]   I'm a 5D shooter.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.760]   Oh, so the canning guy with the lens.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   So getting the new body.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.240]   She might promise my lens collection is all Nikon.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.800]   Yeah, you made a mistake.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.760]   I know at the time, I don't know what happened.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.440]   How did Nikon get passed up by these guys?
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.920]   Well, Nikon was beating them for a minute.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.640]   The D3 was is an amazing little light camera.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.640]   And they were beating them.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.160]   In fact, Scott Born, who does twit photo sold all his Nikon lenses, sold his Nikon
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.560]   bodies, got the D3.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.320]   And now the D3X has been announced.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.480]   But the video is the thing that puts the 5D mark two over the top.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.280]   I think the low light performance on the D3 is better.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:53.600]   But the 1080p video of the McAllister is over at Smugmug, started posting some.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.600]   It's stunning.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.760]   But it's back ordered to like 2020.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.040]   But you're still going to need those really great lenses.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.040]   I got them.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.280]   You got the big zoos, which was the most expensive lens you bought.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.880]   Probably the F1.250, which is about as like two grand.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.880]   The 1.250.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.080]   It's a 50 millimeter, but it's fixed focus, but it's very 2.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.080]   That's an old Canon classic.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.080]   These are one of their best lenses.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.080]   They're going to make it 1.2 years ago.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.960]   I have a good 85 millimeter F. I don't know, macro.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.600]   You need some big zoos.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.320]   I have a 200, but I spent, I got the, it's like the 4.0.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.320]   There's a 2.0.
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.320]   That's the one you want.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.320]   You want a big 2.0.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.320]   That's the one I got.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320]   That's something like a 60.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.320]   They have a 200.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.560]   Yeah, 70 to 200.
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:36.560]   That would be it.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.560]   That's the one you want.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.720]   In fact, that's what the McAllister shot their video with.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   What is that lens cell for?
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.120]   I think it's a couple of grand.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.280]   I think it's more than that.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.280]   Is it?
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.200]   It sounds like about a $4,000 lens.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.480]   Let's use that Amazon application.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.360]   Have you seen that?
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.920]   This is a, I think this is a controversy.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.960]   I'd love to know what you guys think about this.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.200]   This is an iPhone application.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:55.200]   Amazon put it out.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.840]   It's free.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.040]   It's called, I think the Amazon marketplace.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.760]   What it does, logs onto your Amazon account.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:06.080]   Amazon account allows you to single click, you know, order stuff and so forth.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.080]   Well, right.
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.080]   Just like a regular thing.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.080]   But here's the feature.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   It's called the-
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.080]   Everybody's jacked up about this.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080]   Amazon remembers.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.960]   Yeah, this is a big stink right now.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.920]   So I go, I take a picture of a, of a, of anything.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.920]   I go to a bookstore.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.240]   I take a picture of your book, John.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.240]   What is your latest book?
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.240]   Have you still taken books?
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.200]   Oh, I'm going to be coming up with some new stuff.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.440]   So I took a picture of the Chumbie and I say, use photo.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.280]   Now what it's going to do is it's going to add it to my Amazon page.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:33.200]   It uploads it.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.760]   And then it finds the product if it can on Amazon.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.200]   Now it takes a couple of minutes to do that.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.400]   It's not instantaneous.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.360]   I, I did it, I went to a bookstore and I clicked on my friend, Andy, and Ako's book,
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.360]   iPhone fully loaded.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.480]   I found that in about two minutes.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.840]   For about half the price the bookstore was selling it for.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:51.000]   So now I can order it directly from there.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.240]   Completely putting the bookstore out of the business.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.760]   Now I also have taken some pictures of some oddball stuff.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:00.920]   I took a picture of my cough drop, which is a broadcaster thing.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.960]   It says, we're sorry, we're unable to find a similar product.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.760]   It's a, it's a mute button.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.960]   I don't know if they'll be able to find a Chumbie.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.560]   I don't know if this is an interesting as, as an app as the, as that crazy, as that app
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:14.600]   on the iPhone that you put it up to your radio and it play, you listen to a story.
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.840]   Yeah, or a Shazam.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.600]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:17.680]   And then it tells you what the song.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.600]   Don't me, not my door.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.920]   My door is in Melon Liqueur.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.640]   Yes, it is.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.200]   It's green.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.440]   Would you like to try your singing?
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.320]   Cause I have a majority.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.680]   No, I can't sing for crap.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.960]   Any of you, are any of you good singers Julio?
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.600]   Are you good singer?
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.680]   I'm, I'm terrible.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:35.680]   Have you guys seen the, the target app for the, for the iPhone speaking, retailers?
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.680]   No.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.720]   It's, it's kind of cool.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.960]   It's, it's, it's basically a snow globe.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:46.320]   You take your iPhone, you, you set a sex in an age range, give it a shake.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.960]   It does a little snow globe thing and then it gives you a gift suggestion.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:56.120]   Then it tells you where, you know, which stores near you actually have the product.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.240]   But target only, right?
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.560]   Yeah, it's a target.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.640]   So this is their, this is their defense against something like the Amazon thing, I
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.920]   guess is Amazon only, but there are applications on the Google phone.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.600]   The G one that lets you pick a picture of a barcode will say, here's where you can
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.880]   get it cheaper nearby.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.960]   Ooh, that's nice.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.800]   It's a car code I can understand.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:16.560]   But the picture thing, I mean, this article even points it out, it can get a little
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.240]   personal.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.280]   I mean, just, I just thought about what if you're walking on the beach and you're
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.680]   like, Hey, I'd like her.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.080]   They think suit looks pretty good.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.520]   Well, you know, it's human doing it.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:29.760]   They're using the, the Amazon mechanical Turk to look it up.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.680]   So it's getting slapped to set to somebody in India or wherever who's looking at it
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.680]   and finding it on Amazon, but it's Amazon only.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.960]   I really like the Google applications that do the barcode because they, they're
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.480]   three of them.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:42.320]   Well, this phone, this little phone here reads barcodes.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:42.720]   Does it?
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.720]   No kids built that in always, but does it attach to any?
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.320]   No, no, not that I know.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.360]   There may be a does, but I find it doesn't, the barcode reader doesn't work that well.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.360]   The one on the, on the G one is amazing.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:58.280]   Now if the girl walking down the beach had barcode on her, now you're talking.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.280]   Now you're talking.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.480]   That would make sense.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.160]   You know, you can just, you know, that would make sense.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:06.080]   You know, that might actually be not be a bad idea for a product, but
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:09.760]   canis that had individual barcodes on each one of them that would have the,
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.640]   you like a name and phone number, something like that.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.240]   You're assuming that someone walking down the beach and bikini wants you to call her.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:18.000]   No, that's, that's a pretty, yeah, that's unlikely.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:18.800]   I don't think that's the space.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.760]   Especially with us.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.800]   Especially the geek who has that phone.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:25.960]   I have a barcode reader phone and I could call you.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.920]   Would you like me to call you?
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:28.960]   I can't.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.040]   I know how.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.520]   That's about it.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.880]   Yeah, not good.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.840]   Yeah, but I got mixed feelings.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.200]   It's really cool tech.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.200]   I mean, the geek in me is jumping up and down, but it's a bad for, bad for
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.000]   brick and mortar.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.560]   I need to be a brick and mortar retailer.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.120]   You go in there.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.040]   Best buy.
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.320]   So I'd like to look at all the digital cameras, please.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:49.800]   Thank you.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.480]   That's great.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.400]   I appreciate your help.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.960]   Take a picture of the one you want.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.320]   Walk out the door.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.320]   They're going to implement new store policies.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.040]   I mean, they're going to say, if you see somebody taking three and four pictures.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.280]   Well, you know, actually you go to the, I was just, was that
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:06.120]   fries in the big fries and conquered beautiful store, by the way.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.440]   Uh, and they have a big sign out before you get in.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.040]   No photos.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.920]   That's why now you know why.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.120]   Yeah, but this really isn't new.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:22.280]   You know, 15 years ago, I was at my supermarket and I was in one of the
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.240]   aisles and I had a notepad and a pen and I was like writing on it.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:31.240]   Uh, and I got thrown out of the supermarket because people
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.600]   thought I was like, I was doing price comparisons.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.280]   Oh, interesting.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:38.360]   Maybe this is this is just kind of, but there's kind of a tech twist to this issue.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.680]   But the Amazon app, frankly, doesn't bother me too much.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:47.560]   If there's a feature that can be used or misused, it's really up to how
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.760]   the person uses it.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:53.200]   I don't think that the feature itself is well, you know, I don't think you can do
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.400]   anything about this sort of thing.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.000]   And I was talking to you the last week or whenever somebody is mentioning how
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.120]   they go to a store at the airport and then they find a book they want to read
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.960]   and then they go walk out of the bookstore and punch it up on their iPhone
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.680]   and download or download under Kindle.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.480]   Well, that's going to happen.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.120]   I mean, welcome to the real world.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.960]   That's why these stores have got to change.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.720]   They should have their own way of selling right there cheaper or provide
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.200]   something that you don't get in an e-commerce transaction.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.480]   Maybe a nice place to sit.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.280]   The beverages, you know, make service be primary.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.520]   I think it's going to be good in the long run.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:31.240]   If you're going to stay in brick and mortar businesses, you have to provide
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:31.720]   service.
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.360]   You have to do something you can't do online.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:33.680]   Right.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.440]   And they just got to wake up to that fact.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.240]   The only thing they got now is instant gratification.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.960]   That's the only thing they're going on right now.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.760]   A lot of us are getting more patient.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.320]   The more we use online commerce.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:44.800]   It's funny.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:49.080]   It's kind of ironic in a way because I went to a store to buy a book and I was so,
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:54.040]   I'm so conditioned now to instant gratification in the search process in the
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.640]   search and order process that I was miffed by the fact that I had a search
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.080]   through the stacks and then they didn't have it.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:00.640]   It's fun.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:01.200]   I like this.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.720]   Well, you like the serendipity of seeing the books and yeah, and digging around.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.920]   Yeah, it can be fun.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.360]   Discover.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.040]   In this case, I knew exactly what I wanted.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.400]   I wanted to buy some copies.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.280]   I was going to a dinner party.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.280]   I wanted to give it as a gift.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.240]   No, exactly.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.360]   It took me forever to.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.320]   OK, this is that.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.200]   Guess the section.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.320]   And then they didn't have it.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.360]   So I had to go to the front counter and she took literally three or four minutes
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.920]   to find it in their database only to tell me I could have it for you next week.
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.440]   And I, you know, I thought this 20 minute process, I could have in 30 seconds
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.320]   have ordered it and have it tomorrow from Amazon.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.680]   And so it's ironic, isn't it?
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.560]   Buonne of the yeah, it's instant gratification, but not always.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.720]   Yeah, it is ironic.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.640]   And now I think we're getting more and more impatient.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.720]   It works for the deli.
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.560]   It does for sandwiches.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:42.800]   You really don't want to order those.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.200]   You really know.
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:51.800]   There was a turn about as fair play a firefox ad on called Pirates of the Amazon.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.560]   Oh, this was interesting.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.960]   I thought this was really interesting.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.400]   You're on an Amazon page looking at albums or movies.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.000]   It adds a link to click that would send you to the pirate bay so you could
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.240]   download the bit torrent of the movie or the music.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.200]   It's like the pirate version of Jimmy Cricket on your shoulder.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.000]   Hey, you can get this for free.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.360]   That's a little it's the little devil on your shoulder.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.440]   Come on.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.520]   You don't have to pay for that.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.280]   You're going to pay.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.200]   Why are you going to pay for that?
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.080]   It's free over there.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:17.600]   Click here.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.040]   Click here.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:18.960]   Why are you going to pay for that?
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:19.480]   Come on.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.040]   Come on.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:20.760]   You know you want it.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.160]   Why evil apps?
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.720]   It's another good voice by Leo the Port ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:26.360]   Come on.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.040]   You want it.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.200]   You're going to do what you want.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:29.160]   You know you want.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.080]   You know you're going to do it.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:33.080]   It's like a cross between Joe Pesci and something else.
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.160]   He just has these voices.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:35.480]   They're just.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.520]   I don't know where they come from.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.440]   They just come out of it.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:37.960]   Come on.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.080]   I don't know where they come from.
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.080]   John C.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:42.600]   Devorak is online at devorak.org/blog.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.400]   He also does a dozen podcasts.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.040]   Well, you know, go to channel devorak.com.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:47.480]   That's the place now.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.000]   Is that the way?
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.200]   Should we just say that from now on?
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.560]   Yeah, that's, you know, that we should because it did.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.320]   It links to everything and there's no ads on there.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.840]   It's just channel devorak.com and it's.
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.520]   All devorak all the time.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:03.240]   You know, and it's got an RSS feed that takes everything in and a glomerase.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.240]   How do you do that?
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.000]   Eric did it.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.120]   That's what I want to do.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.040]   Oh, he can do that for you.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:08.920]   That's a great idea.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.320]   It's a life stream.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:10.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.040]   Did I get a subscribe, John?
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.480]   Did I get a pop up ad on your site?
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.240]   No.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:15.960]   There's no way.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.320]   The average driver pays $69 a month for auto insurance.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.040]   Give us the zip code where you park at night.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:25.000]   That's from something else.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:25.960]   Don't do it with me.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.640]   Don't click on it.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.640]   Don't click Jack on it.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:30.440]   Oh, no.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.280]   I just, oh, channel devorak.com.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.440]   There are no pop unders.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.920]   There are no pop ups.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:35.480]   You got everything.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.280]   Cranky Geeks, market watch, Noah, Jenna, Tech Five, Twit.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.960]   Tweets, everything.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:41.560]   It's all there.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:42.560]   Yeah, the tweets are there.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.360]   The blog post or everything.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.160]   That's great.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:45.640]   That's nice.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:46.520]   Eric did a nice job for you.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.720]   And it's simple.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.240]   It's clean.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.400]   It's very just straightforward.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.240]   It's a little narrow.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.600]   Yeah, we might want to put another column eventually.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.520]   Oh, I see.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.200]   You're saving room.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.640]   Yeah, because I'll be just too.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:02.320]   Or if people surf there with that, with that great, you know, 320 by 240 browser window, they'll be ready.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.680]   If we're ready.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.400]   It's made for you.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.600]   It's made for the little browser window that you've got there.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.280]   Also, let's not forget the great.
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.960]   Buonamacall@buona.org.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:12.560]   Hey.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.040]   Yeah, it's a dude.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.240]   Yes, indeed. I also do videos at Buona.tv.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.920]   If you guys are into video, I do short video segments.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:21.320]   Theia.
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:25.440]   And I'm taking advantage of the YouTube high def stuff.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:26.240]   So the last.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.320]   I think that's exciting.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.440]   Yeah, the last two weeks of videos are all in the 720p now.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.040]   What does that pro account cost you?
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:36.280]   Well, it's not really a pro account at YouTube.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:36.680]   It's all.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.280]   It's all.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.960]   It's all part of the the freeness.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.320]   I mean, I'm a partner at YouTube, but anyone can upload a gigabyte.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.920]   Anything, you can upload HD at YouTube.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.600]   You even look like you like the Black Patrick Norton.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.400]   You even look like.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.400]   You look just like him.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.360]   I swear to God, he's the Black Patrick.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.240]   Norin, that's why he sounds like Patrick.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.480]   If Patrick got a really good tan, he'd look just like you.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.800]   Hey, we need to know that stuff that the Brits are using.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.720]   These girls are shooting you shoot up this new melatonin.
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.480]   Melatonin.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:05.920]   It's some.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:06.280]   It's not.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.200]   Oh, melanin.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.920]   Yeah, but it's some specific.
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:09.920]   Melanex.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:10.680]   Melox.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:10.920]   Right.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.000]   You shoot it and shoot it and shoot it.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.160]   Next thing you know, you turn black.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:15.320]   For how long?
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.560]   I don't know.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.240]   I never tried it.
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:24.440]   Yeah, I once when I was in radio many years ago, they had a tan that you would eat
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.080]   like it would make you tan, but it turned out was just really heavy doses of beta
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.120]   carotene and you turn it as orange as your shirt.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:30.840]   Yeah, right.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.080]   I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:32.480]   You would be.
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:38.120]   I have seen people with that orange was not a good choice, but I was doing ads for it.
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.960]   So I walked around orange for a few years.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.200]   Wow.
