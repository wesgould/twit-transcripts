[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.240]   The show where we get together with some of the smartest
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.120]   people in technology.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.560]   Talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.440]   We got the real deal today joining us from left to right.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.920]   Mark Millian.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.000]   He's from Bloomberg.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.240]   He is technology editor.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.680]   We've known him for years since he was a small child,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.360]   practically.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.120]   They probably approaching it decade at this point.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.720]   So I first came on the show.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.760]   Because you were at the LA Times then.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.640]   The boy wonder at the LA Times.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.360]   And you're still kind of boyish.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.080]   But you're now big shot.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.000]   So that's good.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.440]   I like-- no, you were always a big shot.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.920]   You started a big shot.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   All right, good to be here.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.760]   So great to see you.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.320]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.480]   Mark also from-- oh, I got to say the new name, right?
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   ITProToday.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.760]   ITProToday.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.200]   Lisa Schmeiser, who is editor at ITProToday.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.680]   Hello.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.680]   Good to see you.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.120]   Formerly, can I say it used to be the super safe one of them now?
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.400]   He's super safe for Windows, yes.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.640]   Completely remodeled, restyled, looking better than ever.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.480]   Paul Thorett's going, turn it.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.680]   ITPro--
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680]   ITProToday.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.720]   Paul does his site and his site is good too.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.440]   So he gets in.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.680]   Well, he's looking back and thinking, I don't know.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.560]   I don't know.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.360]   ITProToday.com.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.720]   Great to have you, Lisa.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.160]   And from the Massachusetts 8th District,
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.400]   where she's a candidate for US Congress, Brianna.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.920]   Whoa.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.960]   So good to be here.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.680]   I'm so sorry I couldn't be in studio today.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   The idea was Brianna was coming out here,
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.360]   and we were going to have everybody in studio.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.640]   But you know what?
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.680]   When you're running for Congress,
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   you're no longer your own master, are you?
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.520]   It's so true.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.920]   It sucks.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.360]   You know, we had some great events.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.760]   We did some good television.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.440]   But you know, I would honestly rather be out in San Francisco
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.600]   talking tech with you.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.800]   So--
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.200]   When's the primary?
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.000]   It is.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.960]   Oh, when is the primary?
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.000]   It's in September.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.840]   So you have-- so this is going to start getting serious now.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.880]   You have three, three, four months.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.440]   Well, it's been serious for a long time.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.920]   So what's happening next week is we've collected almost
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.840]   enough signatures to get on the ballot.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.120]   So we have to start taking them to every single city.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.080]   And then they compare the names of the people that
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.440]   assigned the petition to get us on the ballot.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.960]   Holy cow.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.120]   Versus the record.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.920]   So you know, I'm going to spend the next week.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.000]   Basically, my team going to different circuit clerks
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.600]   offices.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.560]   You got a lot of work ahead of you.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.200]   Holy cow.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:33.080]   Don't know where I want to start here.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.200]   I guess we could probably mention--
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.160]   it seems like it's been more than a week
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.360]   since the YouTube shooting.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.120]   But it did.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.560]   It was this week, wasn't it?
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.200]   It was a long week.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.640]   Yeah, Tuesday.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.720]   It's been a long week.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.680]   It's sad.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.560]   I don't think-- I think only the shooter
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.400]   died, everybody else has survived
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.680]   with some incredible condition.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.920]   But there were three people shot.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.360]   The shooter we now know was a disgruntled YouTuber
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.280]   who felt that she had not been allowed to monetize.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.400]   They had cut off-- she says, I'm being discriminated.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   She felt she didn't get the views she deserved.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.240]   This is just a tragedy.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.520]   I don't know how much more there is to say about it.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.360]   But I wanted to acknowledge it.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.160]   There's not much you can do in this country.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.440]   Her dad called the police.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.680]   Her brother had said there's a problem.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.760]   But you can't arrest somebody for being seeming dangerous.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.920]   And unfortunately, she acted out with a gun at the Union
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.960]   of headquarters in San Bruno.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.440]   It could have been worse, I guess,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.400]   is the only thing I could say.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.760]   And I feel bad for her family.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.440]   Of course, I feel bad for the families
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.520]   of the people affected.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.280]   But part of this comes from the--
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.840]   I think something that's always bothering--
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.160]   I don't blame YouTube for this at all.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.080]   But one thing that's always bothering me about YouTube
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.960]   is they really trumpet the YouTube stars, the 10 or 20
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.600]   people who make money.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.280]   And they downplay the fact that that's
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.200]   a really tiny minority out of all the people who work like the dickens
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.360]   to create content on YouTube.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.160]   And I think that probably she got a little bit bit
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.920]   by this culture that I should be doing.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.720]   I should be one of them.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.400]   Well, demonetization also hit a lot of people across YouTube
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.640]   hard.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.360]   I just pulled up a Bloomberg story from December of last year
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.280]   when YouTube changed its algorithm.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.160]   And it's a Bloomberg story.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   Very nice.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.240]   Now you have to have 1,000 followers of 1,000 views--
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   --on here named Joe Taylor, who runs a motorcycle focus
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.800]   challenge called JoeGo101.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   And after YouTube shifted its algorithm
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.160]   and began demonetizing videos, his revenue
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.080]   dropped from $6,000 a month to $1,000 a month.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.840]   So you're looking at over an 80% drop in revenue for somebody.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.600]   And a lot of these people do quit their jobs
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.280]   and try to do this full time.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.240]   And unless you have enough money in the bank to weather
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.600]   an 80% drop in revenue, that you cannot control.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.160]   Because you have no transparency into how these videos are
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.280]   exposed or pushed out.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.600]   It's not a viable business model, but I don't think a lot of
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.440]   YouTubers know that.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   They focus more on the production aspect.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.840]   And live more young.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.760]   Hope to become stars.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.640]   I mean, it was an extreme, horrible, inappropriate reaction
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.520]   from this woman.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.600]   But this is like the heart of one of the biggest issues
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.240]   for YouTube as a company is bouncing the growth
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.880]   of a certain user base and appeasing advertisers.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.120]   And a large base of people who want to make a living
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.000]   on their platform.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.920]   And I think there have been some studies recently of asking
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.400]   kids what careers they aspire to be.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.640]   And YouTube stars near the top of the list.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.760]   Every 12-year-old I meet wants to be a Minecraft video
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.320]   creator on YouTube and be a star.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.200]   But to Lisa's point, there's very few people who are able
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.400]   to make a living off of that.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.240]   Mark, can I add something on to that?
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.080]   I studied journalism in college.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.320]   And our program was separated into two parts.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.200]   You had the television part and you had the print journalism
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.320]   part.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.120]   And for me, the print journalism people were the ones that--
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.880]   that's what I did.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.080]   Shoe leather work going out, looking at public records,
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.760]   doing interviews.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.520]   And then the other people in the department kind of were the
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.840]   ones that really wanted to be on television.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.240]   That was their goal to get that attention.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.120]   And I've always felt that--
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.280]   I think everyone here in the studio today, we're here
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.400]   because we put our passion of knowledge and reporting
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.720]   our career first.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.320]   And I think that's what leads to the wider success, if that
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.680]   makes sense to you.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.080]   So my number one suggestion to anyone that comes up to me
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.040]   is how do I make a career or get a podcast?
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.280]   It's become really good at what you do professionally.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.520]   And then the rest of it I think flows from there.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.160]   Yeah, I mean, again, her argument
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.040]   was not appropriate.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.400]   Like, the way she handled it.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:08.920]   She doesn't know.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.200]   But I don't know.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.040]   I'm not a psychologist, but it feels like she had a break.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.240]   Yeah, she had this--
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.160]   she was living in a car.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.120]   Her family knew that there was something bad going on.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.480]   They'd file the missing report.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.680]   It does point to one of the perils of building your
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.920]   business brand or your business model on any sort of
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.240]   network that you don't own.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:31.680]   But you're like--
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.960]   Like it's with Instagram, right?
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   I was just about to say, Instagram, Facebook.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.120]   There was a content form that recently went out of business
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.000]   after Facebook changed its algorithm, because it was no
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.760]   longer driving traffic.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.640]   Again, going in and shooting up a workplace is never an
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.560]   appropriate response to anything.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.760]   And it's clear that YouTube didn't cause whatever break
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.320]   she had.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.160]   But it does also point out that the way YouTube is running
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.400]   its business model, it wouldn't hurt for journalists like us
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.640]   to start looking at, well, exactly how well-versed in the
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.880]   way YouTube works, are the people who try to make their
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   living on it?
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   And are they considering what's going to happen if this
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.000]   platform becomes less viable over time?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.240]   Or if they are the ones who no longer get picked up by an
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.960]   algorithm or think things like that?
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.040]   The peril of depending on any network that you don't own
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.320]   for your business model is the minute that that network
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.320]   decides they can make money doing something differently,
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.360]   if they will, and it's either up to you to scramble to catch up
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   with it.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.680]   So, I mean, wouldn't that be an argument, though?
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.080]   I think one of the biggest issues, if we want to get this
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.160]   to be wider than video, media publishers like Joshua
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.760]   Topolsky, he started the outline, right?
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.760]   He is very much at the mercy of Facebook's algorithm, as far
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.400]   as getting his stories out there.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.960]   That's basically a monopoly.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.440]   When you're looking at broadcasting video content in many
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.320]   ways, YouTube is a monopoly.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.080]   I use Vimeo, but it just doesn't have the same audience.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:08.200]   So, I think, you know, I think if I were elected, I would
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.960]   want to start to take a hard look at what certainly seems to
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.640]   be a duopoly, as far as broadcasting this content,
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   because you shouldn't be at the mercy of any one individual
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   company.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.520]   I think it would be better for everyone if there's more
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.040]   competition in this space.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.840]   At the same time, I don't feel like this is the fault of
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   YouTube or Facebook or Instagram.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:36.080]   They created a business that was wildly successful and
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.040]   fulfilled an amazing need.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.920]   I mean, you know, Siva Vijayanathan, we talked about this on
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.800]   Wednesday on This Week in Google, said the people who say,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.120]   "Leave Facebook are actually not being realistic.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.160]   They don't understand that in many parts of the world.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.520]   Facebook is the only way it's your internet.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.680]   It's the only way we communicate."
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.440]   I guess you could ascribe a little bit of that fault to
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.560]   maybe these companies when they misuse their monopoly.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.920]   But most of the, it seems to me, most of the time, this is
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.120]   just they're really doing well.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.080]   So let me ask that question philosophically, because I think
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:19.360]   in this country, we've always celebrated rags to riches
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.760]   and building something great and having a great success.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.080]   And there's always been a little resistance to the idea that
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.440]   when you get to a certain size that the government says,
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.960]   "No, you're too big.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.720]   You can't be that big."
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.880]   The government, I don't think anybody can test the
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.600]   government's role in antitrust.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.320]   That if you have a monopoly in a business and you start to
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.920]   use that monopoly to kill other businesses to
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.560]   disadvantage consumers, that's wrong.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.280]   And that needs to be regulated.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.840]   But what if Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, don't do
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.280]   monopolistic things, they're just super successful?
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.200]   Should we, what do you think, Brianna?
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.760]   Is that cause for regulation?
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.400]   - I think it's really tough, right?
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.080]   Because look, look at WhatsApp, right?
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.000]   Like Facebook bought that and then they rolled that and
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.760]   eventually turned into Facebook Messenger, which is a tool
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.920]   I use all the time.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.760]   It's an excellent app.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.840]   So I think it's really hard because you have these larger
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   companies and smaller companies are funded in the VC system
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.840]   with the assumption that someone like Facebook or Google
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.640]   or Amazon is eventually going to buy them, but it also creates
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.000]   a situation where it's not realistic to think they'll ever
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.240]   get taken over.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   Like if some fundamental shift in social media happens,
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.000]   Facebook will be right there to either duplicate those
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.600]   features or to buy that company outright.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.760]   So I'm not going to tell you, it's straightforward or
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.600]   simple.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.960]   I'm just saying there are things we need to start thinking
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.040]   about because it is very clearly a duopoly with the
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.600]   ad business.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   - But Mark, I know there's also a strong current of thought
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.560]   among, especially this is especially true among
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.480]   technologists that you don't even have to worry because
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.440]   at the pace technology moves and the way technology moves,
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.160]   nobody's advantage is permanent.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.840]   - Yeah, if you talk to the people inside YouTube, which we
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.000]   have reporters who do, they don't think that they're on top
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.840]   of the world.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.320]   They're looking at Netflix and they're looking at Hulu
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.160]   and they're looking at what Apple's pouring into online
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.360]   video and Amazon's pouring into online video.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.720]   And they in many ways want their business to look more
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.560]   like Netflix.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.840]   They're trying to do more like high quality content and
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.360]   working with the studios.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.280]   - Is that because subscriber streams are a more reliable
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.200]   former revenue than say advertising buys, which can go
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.040]   up in town depending?
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   - Subscriber is, yes, subscriptions are good, but also
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   advertisers will pay more for quality content than they will
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.360]   for potentially having their ads next to not see videos.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.200]   - Right, as an advertiser, you don't know what you're
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.560]   gonna be on.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.280]   I suppose you could say, well, not on that channel,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.400]   not on that channel, not on that channel, but if you don't,
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.360]   and this Twitter has a similar problem, if you can't say,
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.400]   my advertisement is gonna appear in a place that
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.920]   that's why we do well, 'cause they know what they're
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.880]   getting when they advertise here, but you don't know
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.240]   what you're getting when you advertise in YouTube.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.600]   - If you can't control what you're associated with,
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.400]   you can find yourself as the target of a boycott or
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.760]   a public outrage machine with, did you know that you're
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   supporting such and such, and then you're playing defense?
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.000]   - Right, and we've seen that happen.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.320]   - And you're playing defense, that way.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   - But YouTube, now YouTube, is YouTube profitable?
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.160]   - Yes.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.800]   - It is, yes, and it's certainly high revenue, many
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.960]   billions of dollars in revenue.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.000]   - Yeah, and there was a lot of, when they bought it for
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.920]   a billion dollars, there was a lot of them.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.840]   - People thought they were crazy, 'cause they were in the
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.040]   midst of lawsuits with NBC, I thought, in fact, I remember
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.200]   talking-- - It was deeply unprofitable.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.000]   - Yeah, I remember talking to the founder, Steve Chen,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.280]   and I can't remember the other guy's name, but we
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.800]   interviewed them on net at night before they were
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.680]   purchased, and I said, "How are you gonna survive?
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.160]   "You're gonna be sued out of business.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.560]   "All the content that's really successful, and at the time
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.840]   "it was stuff from Saturday Night Live, and NBC was furious.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.600]   "All the content that's making you money,
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   "you're gonna get pulled down."
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.720]   But I think what happened is NBC realized,
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.000]   "Oh, you know what, we shouldn't sue them.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.200]   "This is really good promotion.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.680]   "This is Saturday Night Live, someone's getting viewers."
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.640]   - They found that out with the Jimmy Fallon show.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.080]   - It's better to post on YouTube.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.160]   - Yeah, 'cause it builds up a completely different audience.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.880]   I heard there have been, I read an article about how
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.800]   the Jimmy Fallon show does better precisely because
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.080]   they do try to do a lot of viral clips, and that builds
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.520]   awareness among audiences that are not routinely
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.240]   late night TV watchers, but now become so, thanks.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.840]   - I also should point out that while YouTube is making
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.480]   tons of money, not a lot of that money, we don't know
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.560]   how much goes back to the creators, right?
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.480]   I mean, they never have admitted how much money goes back
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.320]   to the creators.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.120]   - Yeah, and it's out of half.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.280]   - Yeah, I don't know. - 30%.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.600]   We don't know.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.960]   Revenue for YouTube, let's see, this is alphabet.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.440]   Let me see if I can break it down.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.120]   This is the other problem, you must have this problem
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120]   all the time in Bloomberg.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.800]   Companies no longer report.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.040]   They no longer give you, even publicly held companies,
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.920]   that ought to be telling you how many Apple watches
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.640]   were sold or how much money YouTube makes.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.920]   They lump it all together.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.480]   They give you as little information as they possibly can.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.600]   - We looked this up in my Bloomberg terminal here.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.760]   - I was just about to ask, can you look up the label?
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.200]   - Oh, see, he's got access, man.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.720]   - Can you look up the latest SEC filings?
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.720]   - Google has 42% of the US ad market for digital ads.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.560]   Facebook 23%, so between the two of them,
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.440]   65% of the digital ad spending goes to those two companies.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.000]   That right there tells you something.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.480]   - It's only supposed to rise.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.760]   - And it's only gonna be 100% pretty quick, I think.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.120]   - What does your terminal tell you?
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.800]   Does it bring your magic card?
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.080]   - Well, it breaks it down by advertising revenue and--
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.920]   - Yes, see, they won't--
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.760]   - Yeah, see, they won't.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.800]   - And I think they've broken it out under display,
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.680]   which includes video and graph glass,
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.880]   which are not a huge business for Google,
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.280]   but I'm not finding that immediately.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.360]   - I'm looking at the results and they don't really say
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.000]   how much YouTube is making.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.680]   - They're making money overall.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.080]   No question about that.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.640]   - So I think this is kind of,
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.760]   if you're gonna say the big story of 2018 in general,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.120]   is about the growth of these companies,
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.440]   we interviewed a professor at NYU last year,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.000]   Scott Galloway about his book, The Four,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.080]   and this is what he was saying, is these big companies,
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.160]   I think his four were Amazon--
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.560]   - Do you do Fang?
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.360]   - I don't think Netflix was in there.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.240]   Those are the Fangs, I just learned that term.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.080]   - Yeah, uh-huh.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.240]   (laughing)
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.320]   - I think it was Amazon, I've been watching CNBC a lot,
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.080]   Lisa, that's why I know it.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.600]   They're all talking about the Fangs.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.320]   It was Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.160]   - Sometimes they do Fang with the long A,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.320]   but you throw an apple too, so.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.240]   - Ah, yeah.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.520]   - Netflix was not in there, but maybe it should have been.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.880]   He talked about the fact that these guys
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.160]   are getting so big, so powerful,
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.440]   and so you look at this with Facebook,
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.200]   I mean, there's no question for Good or Ill,
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.960]   that Facebook had a huge impact on the 2016 election,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.320]   and thereby had a huge impact on the world,
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.960]   same thing in the Philippines, Myanmar,
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.360]   all over the world, Facebook has a huge impact.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.320]   For Good or for Ill, I'm not gonna make any judgment on it.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.120]   YouTube, Google, Search, these companies.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.280]   If you don't, for instance, if Google doesn't list you
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.920]   in its search, it's as if you are taking off the internet.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.320]   That's how powerful these companies are, right?
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.080]   - And so Galway is saying, "These companies better watch out."
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.120]   Now he said this last year,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.000]   and I think it's starting to come true this year,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.160]   these companies better watch out,
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.680]   because governments, particularly the US government,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.000]   are gonna start sitting up and taking notice,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.320]   and starting to regulate you, so if you don't self-regulate,
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.560]   you're gonna be regulated.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.840]   Mark Zuckerberg is gonna be testifying in Congress
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.320]   this week on the 11th.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.520]   - Yeah, I feel like I have a particularly unique point
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.560]   of view on this, because for us,
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.080]   we are a political campaign that runs on issues
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.560]   like privacy, net neutrality, encryption.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.080]   These are really hardcore key tech issues
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.000]   that don't have a broad appeal.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.480]   And I benefit every single day
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.760]   from being able to go on Facebook and get ads
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.360]   and to really find that audience
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.240]   in a way that I could not a decade ago.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.960]   And that is what has let me create
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.000]   a successful political campaign.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.480]   It's micro-targeting.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.760]   I personally benefit from that.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.400]   At the same time, it is so unregulated,
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.120]   and it's not held to the same standards
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.360]   as print or television or magazines.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.280]   And I could put an ad out that could say anything,
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.960]   literally anything, and there's no check
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.880]   on who's paying for it, there's no check
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.560]   on what the content is.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.720]   It's just really, it's a jungle.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.200]   And while it's certainly more convenient for me
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.680]   to not have to jump through any hurdles,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.960]   I don't really think it's good for democracy.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.800]   So I think this is one of these things where it's not,
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.120]   it's too simplistic to say like Facebook is just terrible
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.520]   because micro-targeting is good, it has benefits.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.280]   It lets new constituencies be heard.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.800]   At the same time, I think we would all agree
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.560]   that outside nation should not be buying ads
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.600]   to influence American elections.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.640]   - It's really tough, 'cause you're exactly right.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.880]   I think a lot of people, a lot of Trump supporters say,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.200]   oh, you Clinton supporters are just whining
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.600]   'cause you didn't use Facebook as well as we did.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.000]   And there may be some merit to that.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.160]   - Yeah, well, it was in the argument
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.560]   for when Barack Obama's team in 2008.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.560]   - And Obama used Facebook very effectively.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.400]   - Well, he used Facebook.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.640]   - In 2012, not in 2008.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.240]   - In 2008, they did great data mining.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.400]   And they did great work with email
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.720]   and part of different segments.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.000]   - Facebook to use.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.360]   - But the point is they set a precedent in 2008
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.800]   with the way that they said data can be used
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.160]   to build a political campaign.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.000]   - I remember it very well.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.320]   - And data can be used to build your audience
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.600]   and to figure out how much they can give to you,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.680]   how often you can reliably hit them up,
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.840]   what appeals they're going to use, things like that.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.080]   - In 2012, the Obama campaign used the information
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.680]   they haven't had about who had voted for them in 2008
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.440]   to get out the vote in 2012.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.800]   And I think that that's actually legitimate.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.560]   That's a legitimate use of micro-targeting.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.440]   So there are legitimate uses for it.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.000]   So it is, this is very challenging to say that,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.960]   for instance, we're talking about,
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.240]   are these companies misusing monopoly?
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.400]   It's very hard to say that Apple,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.520]   because Apple doesn't make messenger available
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   for non-Apple platforms, is that monopolistic?
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.640]   Is that, no, 'cause Apple's not a monopoly
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.520]   and yet it feels like any competitive behavior.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.360]   - Well, you're talking about the--
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.280]   - I don't envy you, Brianna.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.440]   If you get elected, you got a challenging--
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.760]   - Well, you're talking about targeting, though.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.480]   The thing is, is how well-educated are we as targets?
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.320]   How easy is it?
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.480]   - To me, I feel like it's our responsibility.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   - Well, how easy is it for us to learn the skills necessary
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.680]   to figure out who's targeting you,
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.760]   why they're targeting you,
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.680]   what the triggers were that trip that off.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.000]   - And I think the platforms--
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.840]   - It's been used to do that in retail, for example.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.320]   - The platforms need to be responsible
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.280]   to your point, Brianna.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.680]   Facebook announced that this week
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.640]   that they're gonna require verified identities
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.000]   for future political ads.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.680]   This is something that was not required
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.600]   of digital platforms,
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.040]   well, it was always required of broadcast platforms
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.360]   that if you buy an ad on radio or TV,
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.200]   that ad has to be clearly identified,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.960]   who's paying for it.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.280]   But digital, that's why Russians could buy ads
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.440]   because there was no requirement.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.840]   Facebook unilaterally, not because of regulation,
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.880]   but unilaterally said, all right, from now on,
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.480]   we are going to make sure we know who's buying those ads
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.600]   and that those ads are identified
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.040]   as being bought by somebody,
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.080]   eliminating, I guess, Russian influence.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.120]   That's the kind of thing I would hope these platforms
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.440]   would start to do.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.920]   Responsibly self-regulate.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.400]   It's a kind of thing that Congress,
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.400]   it's hard for, we can barely get Congress to do anything.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.600]   - It's true.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.680]   - And some of these really need pretty details.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.520]   - Well, one of the things--
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.160]   - I'd say the tech subcommittee is only,
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.920]   it's basically eight votes control, the tech subcommittee.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.640]   So you don't have to get all of Congress
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.720]   to understand stuff because this particular committee
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.280]   does their work and gets rolled into larger appropriations bills.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.200]   So that's the way subcommittees work.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.160]   We don't have to educate all of Congress
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.000]   on this.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.560]   I do have to say, we're talking about micro-targeting.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.520]   This is legit.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.200]   I think no one on this show would disagree with this.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.800]   Like this is a positive use of technology.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.960]   But one of the things was, you know,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.120]   a topic that we were thinking about talking at this week
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.960]   was Karis Swisher's interview with Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.800]   And one of my absolute favorite moment in there
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.120]   where she got him dead to rights
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.040]   is she started talking about Facebook's plan
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.760]   to basically make apps that were built into Facebook
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.120]   where app developers could basically pull all of this data.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.520]   And back in 2014, I condemned this.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.920]   Every technology journalist condemned it.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.160]   Everyone could see this mess coming from a mile away.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.600]   And Facebook came with this kind of tech utopianism.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.880]   And they just ignored it and marched forward with it.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.320]   And then Cambridge Analytica happened.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.880]   And I think we're not-- no one would argue
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.040]   about like micro-targeting being an issue.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.320]   But when anyone can get basically all this creepy amount
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.120]   of information about you, where you are, what you buy,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.440]   like the exact locations that you go to,
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.880]   and can copy it, and can use it for anything,
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.600]   that is really going so far that I do think it fundamentally
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   threatens our democracy.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   So I agree like government regulation gives me intense pause.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.720]   But there's also something.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.240]   There's something fundamentally wrong with Facebook
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.680]   where we keep having this discussion.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.080]   And Mark Zuckerberg has been apologizing
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.760]   for these exact issues for 15 years now.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.200]   Well, that's the irony of this, is if you read Mark's
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.560]   apologies going back to his freshman year at Harvard,
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.040]   when he apologized for face mash, which was pre-Facebook.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.440]   It was a thing he made.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.200]   It's in the movie, not that the movie was particularly accurate,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.600]   but if you saw the movie, you saw that he scraped pictures
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.440]   of Harvard students from the Harvard internet
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.840]   and created a hot or not app that people would vote on it.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.240]   And it raised a huge fur, and he had to write an apology
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.800]   in the Harvard Crimson, which--
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.280]   I actually find it, because Zane up to Vicki
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.880]   wrote about this and wired this week.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.960]   Sounds exactly like the apologies.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.480]   We're continuing to hear from Mark.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.920]   Almost word for word.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.440]   I have it up here.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.640]   Yeah, go ahead and read it if you want.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.480]   The first apology from the Harvard Crimson
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.040]   is right at the top.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.680]   She calls it his 14-year apology tour.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.200]   I can read it.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:44.800]   I've got it here.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.400]   She said, this is Mark writing in the Harvard Crimson.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.520]   See if this sounds familiar.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.320]   I hope you understand this is not how I meant for things to go,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.200]   and I apologize for any harm done as a result of my neglect
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.680]   to consider how quickly the site would spread,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.560]   and its consequences thereafter.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.600]   I definitely see how my intentions could
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.200]   be seen in the wrong light.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.640]   The problem is Mark's been doing this since 2003.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.200]   He's always apologized.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.240]   He's always said, we're going to do better.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.520]   This was when the news feed was launched,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.200]   which I forgot.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.040]   Upset a lot of people, because they
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.600]   thought they were sharing with family and friends,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.480]   and suddenly their shares were showing up in the news feed.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.520]   This was a big mistake on our part, says Mark,
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.560]   and I'm sorry for it.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.720]   We really messed this one up.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.360]   We did a bad job of explaining what the new features were
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.000]   and an even worse job of getting in control of them.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.120]   2007, the member of the Beacon Advertising System,
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.480]   this offended me because my friends would see ads and say,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.240]   Leo LaPorte just bought adult diapers.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.520]   Would you like to?
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.920]   And that's offensive.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.480]   There was a--
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.440]   Don't judge my private life.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.040]   50,000 Facebook users signed a petition saying,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.640]   Facebook, stop invading my privacy.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.040]   Here's-- listen to the words.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.200]   We simply did a bad job with this release,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.480]   and I apologize for it.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.040]   I'm not proud of the way we handle this situation.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.440]   I know we can do better, except they never--
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.000]   Has anyone ever asked him how they did better?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.520]   Ever.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.160]   Two.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.800]   Following a-- following a--
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.880]   I think I know we can do better.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.600]   Well, how have you done better from the last time you--
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.720]   We just missed the mark another time, 2010.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.520]   We heard the feedback.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.680]   There needs to be a simpler way to control your information.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.800]   In the coming weeks, we'll add privacy controls
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.880]   that are simpler to use.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.040]   That's in 2010.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.080]   Zaneb says, I'm going to run out of space.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.600]   So let's jump to 2018.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.160]   It goes on and on.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.480]   And it's not-- oh, now, I have to say,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.160]   I have a personal opinion about Mark
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.400]   that is not informed by having ever met him or knowing
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.640]   anything about him, and I'm afraid it's
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.760]   a fairly negative opinion.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.880]   So I'm going to stand back and recuse myself from this.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.720]   But I do feel-- I remember he has voting control
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.800]   of the company.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.520]   He has never given up enough of the company
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.240]   to lose total control.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.680]   Zuckerberg is an absolute control of Facebook.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.240]   There's nobody else.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.000]   The board can't fire him.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.640]   I'm sure he hears voices from other people, I hope.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.880]   But then he gets to choose.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.320]   He gets to be hearing them from where inside his head?
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.080]   You never know.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.800]   I know.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   That's unfair, Mark.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.560]   But I don't feel-- I feel like he doesn't get it,
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:28.440]   or he doesn't care, and he continues to break the rules.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.480]   And I think at some point, we need to say, OK, Mark,
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.360]   time's up.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.840]   Is that just me?
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.120]   Leo, I really want to back up everything you just said.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.520]   A question I get a lot recently is, OK, Brie,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.600]   you're talking a lot about Facebook.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.760]   Why are you talking more about Google?
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.280]   Good question.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.880]   And I can say, in my personal opinion,
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   I know a lot of people that work at both of those companies.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.280]   I genuinely see-- Google is not a company without problems.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.520]   But I genuinely see when Google messes up,
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:09.240]   I think they have generally speaking done better at solving
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.080]   it in a realistic way and moving forward.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.400]   Look at Android.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.680]   I think if you look at the subsequent releases of Android,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.400]   they've clearly moved in the right direction for privacy
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.920]   and informing users about what's going on
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.040]   and what data they're giving up.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.480]   So I think Google clearly has issues.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.840]   And if I'm elected, I will certainly
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.160]   be having conversations with them.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.720]   But there seems to be a fundamental disconnect
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:46.080]   from reality in what Facebook says and what happens there.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.920]   And what has worried me a great deal
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.080]   is some of the conversations I've had in the past few weeks
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.560]   with people that work at Facebook.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.400]   It's not generous, but I don't feel
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.320]   like they're realistic about the problems that they're facing.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.080]   In some ways, maybe they're true believers.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   They really believe in how they're changing the world
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.240]   by connecting people that's a positive.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.440]   It's like that memo, the Bosworth memo, where you said,
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.800]   well, terror is going to use it.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.520]   But in the long run, we make a bigger difference.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.080]   So it's OK.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.440]   And you know what?
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.600]   I kind of understand that.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.480]   That's the same explanation Phil Zimmerman gave me
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.640]   when I asked him about PGP.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   I said, Phil, you've invented a technology that lets bad guys
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.960]   talk to each other completely anonymously.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.520]   He said, well, you create the technology.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.000]   It's a net good because privacy is important.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.120]   Can't stop it from being misused.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.160]   This is a conversation that's going to be going on all year.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.560]   I don't do it every show.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.120]   I didn't mean to bring it up again.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.440]   Of course, we're going to watch with interest
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.760]   with Mark Sexes to Congress.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.640]   But I don't feel like he'll say anything that is materially
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.640]   going to change the fact of--
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.120]   Nope.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.440]   --this is how Facebook's designed.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.440]   This is its business model.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.680]   This is what it's going to continue to do.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   And I don't know if the government should regulate it.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.960]   Jeff Jarvis got furious at me on Wednesday.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.080]   I said, I just should shut it down.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.720]   He said, you can't do that.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.840]   I said, no, I don't mean that.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.240]   The government shouldn't ever do that.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.760]   But maybe shouldn't ever do that.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.600]   No, I don't think so.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.320]   Maybe the market should.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.120]   I think they need to be--
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.280]   I think a good place to start is if they are reckless in how
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.600]   third parties use the data that they're given,
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.200]   I would like to see them opened up to civil liability.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.480]   I think a lot of the time, the way to solve this
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.560]   is we value money in the United States more than people
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.800]   and certainly more than privacy.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.240]   So I think if we open them up to civil liability,
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:51.240]   if neglect on their part leads to these huge data breaches
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:56.440]   that abuse all of our data and open us up to identity theft,
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.520]   I think that is one tenable solution.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.920]   I think I mentioned this last week.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.200]   Corey Doctorow was on the new screen
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.600]   several weeks ago with Love Corey.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.240]   I love his point of view and all of this.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.400]   He said, there's two things that can really
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.720]   make a difference here.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.080]   I hope you will help do this.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.520]   Brianna is eliminate the rules that require--
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.240]   I think you were on when we talked about this, actually.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.360]   That require arbitration.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.400]   That allow people to sue, if necessary,
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.840]   to protect their privacy.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.480]   If Equifax loses your data, most of us
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.360]   have contracts with these companies that say,
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:37.200]   you could go into mandatory arbitration and it's binding.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.760]   Eliminate that and say, no, you can sue.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.240]   You have the right to take them to court.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.720]   And the other thing Corey said, which I think
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.080]   is more important for our audience,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.680]   is you don't like it, build your own.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   Let's build some social networks that are privacy forward.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.240]   That connects people without--
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.200]   So this is not me saying it's a bad idea,
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.920]   but what I'm saying is with that kind of solution,
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.160]   which you're basically acknowledging
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.440]   is that privacy is a luxury, that you should be able to buy
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:03.920]   and sell.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.560]   It's not inherent civic right.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.480]   Well, it isn't in the Constitution,
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   but I guess the courts have mentioned it.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.640]   Well, no, and I'm not saying a legal thing either way,
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.840]   what I'm saying is when you're like,
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.960]   well, if you don't like this social network, which
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.720]   does not afford you any measure of data
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.360]   transparency or data privacy, build one
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.000]   where the marketable feature of your social network
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   is either data transparency or data privacy,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   you're not challenging the notion that privacy is a commodity
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.760]   which can be bought, sold, or monetized.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:40.000]   And the question I'm asking is, is privacy actually
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.120]   some sort of civic right?
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.160]   Or is it merely a construct that may be going out of style?
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.480]   I mean, I bought my second iPhone X last week
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.600]   like a separate phone for call time,
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.320]   because iPhone is the platform that has better security.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.200]   And we have to take that incredibly serious on my campaign.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.560]   And as I'm sitting there buying my second, what is it?
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.640]   $1,200, $1,400 phone.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.320]   I'm going like, this is really privileged.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.920]   This is privileged.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.600]   There is a great, and I encourage everybody to read it,
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.680]   Medium Post from Greg Ferrenstein,
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.120]   the birth and death of privacy, 300 years of history
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:24.760]   told through 46 images, which will tell you a lot about,
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   you know, our notion of modern notion of privacy
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.120]   is very different from the historic notion of privacy.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.480]   People all slept in one room together
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.400]   until relatively recently.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   Most homes didn't have walls separating rooms until 1500 AD.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   To that point, there was a really good,
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.720]   the former Monty Python Terry Jones or former current.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.560]   I never know.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.400]   They're quantum.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.240]   Yes.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.080]   He's a Python.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.720]   But he wrote a really great book about the Tower of London.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.360]   And one of the mind-blowing things that got me is he said,
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.080]   you have to understand that for years,
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.880]   comfort was not a physical concept.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.560]   Like the idea that you should be physically comfortable
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.720]   in a space didn't really hit popular consciousness
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.080]   until about the 1800s.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.920]   Comfort was more a psychological thing
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.800]   and a lot of courtly life and the idea of comfort
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.840]   revolved around the social relationships you had one on one
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.840]   and how other people watched you have them too.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.120]   So that ties into this as well.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.320]   It was the opposite of privacy.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.640]   Yeah, but that ties into the idea of privacy as well.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.480]   Is it?
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.480]   You're getting back to that now with Instagram.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.280]   Yeah, you live your life very much in public.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.400]   People could comment on how you comported yourself.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.480]   Beds used to be so expensive
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.080]   that most people didn't have their own bed till 1700.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.280]   For most of the history of humanity,
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.480]   we all slept in the same bed.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.880]   Information privacy is very new.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.640]   Well, the phrase "make your bed" comes down to people
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.680]   literally having to fill a sack with straw.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.160]   (laughing)
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.320]   Speaking of comfort, I should do a Casper ad here,
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.360]   but I don't have one, but...
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.960]   (laughing)
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.800]   Let's say...
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.560]   You're missing out, Casper gets on Leo.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.720]   Let's take a break.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.720]   This is a, I highly recommend anybody who wants to think
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.040]   about this kind of history of privacy from a medium
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.040]   is the Ferrenstein wire.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.640]   Vince Surf, he's quoting Vince Surf,
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.560]   "Privacy may actually be an anomaly."
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.000]   It is kind of more modern,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.400]   and it's really fascinating to just learn
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.240]   a little bit of the history.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.760]   That really helps inform the conversation about,
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.520]   well, what does it mean to...
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.040]   Why do we want privacy?
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.280]   Maybe it isn't something that belongs in the civic sphere.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.520]   Maybe it's fascinating, frankly.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.360]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.000]   We've got a great panel.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.680]   Mark Millian is here from Bloomberg.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.440]   He is editor, technology editor there.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.000]   Great to have you, Mark.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.440]   Lisa Schmeiser from ITProToday.com.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.480]   She's editor there, and Brianna Wu,
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.680]   who is a developer, of course,
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.200]   in fact, before the show we were talking about
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.000]   computer programming, that was so much fun, Brianna.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   You know, frankly, I didn't start Twit to talk about
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.480]   political issues, monopolies,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.360]   companies getting too large privacy.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.480]   I started Twit to talk about programming,
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.800]   which processor to buy.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.720]   That's what I really would like to talk about.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.160]   I'm sure our audience would too.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.280]   But technology is so important nowadays
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.680]   that that conversation really has bled into the public sphere.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.480]   It's really what we all need to talk about.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.400]   Anyway, great to have you.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.800]   Good luck running for Congress in Massachusetts,
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.440]   8th District. Thank you.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.400]   And if you see a petitioner outside your local,
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.640]   Pigly Weekly, and what is the grocery store in Massachusetts?
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.560]   You know, Whole Foods is big.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.280]   Whole Foods, there are a lot of hippies that go there.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   Good place for signing.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.400]   Very good for Democrats.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.120]   Is that where you put your petition gatherers?
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.960]   Put them out front of Whole Foods.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.600]   So if you see somebody with a clipboard outside of Whole Foods,
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.840]   and you can say, yeah, put Brianna Wu on the ballot.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.680]   You do that.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.800]   Will you please? Absolutely.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.600]   Do you have to be in the Massachusetts 8th to do that?
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.400]   Yes, absolutely must be.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.600]   And you can, you cannot be a registered Republican
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.200]   or a registered libertarian.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.600]   You can be anything else but not those two things.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.640]   Okay. So you don't have to be a Democratic voter.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.840]   You could just be independent.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.880]   You could be independent, absolutely.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.040]   That's also, those laws are really weird.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.040]   Those laws are so arcane.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.240]   I could talk about it all day, Leo.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.240]   I really like it.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.440]   California, we did all sorts of weird things
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.240]   when anybody could vote for anybody and oh my God, it's crazy.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.760]   And to the point where we had a district last election
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.680]   that had two Democrats running against each other.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.040]   Oh, thank you.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.040]   Okay.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.040]   Our show today brought to you, I actually,
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.160]   and people will think this funny when I say this,
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.480]   but I like having the Republican Party
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.480]   and the Democratic Party.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.520]   I like the bi-play of philosophies.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.440]   We need that conversation.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.160]   That's what we're losing with this huge polarization
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.640]   is the civil conversation between opposing points of view.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.040]   We need that.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.520]   We don't, I don't want a uniformity of point of view.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.280]   I just want us to be able to talk, please.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.480]   Our show today brought now.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.760]   Now we can talk about WordPress.com.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.560]   This is where I host my blog where so many people I know,
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.840]   including like really smart people like Steve Gibson,
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.200]   who actually runs a server in his house.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.160]   But when it comes to making a blog, WordPress.com,
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.320]   that explains a little bit about why 30%
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.440]   of all the websites in the world, 30%, close to one third,
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.400]   run on WordPress.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.480]   WordPress is awesome.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   I love it.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.440]   And when you get hosting at WordPress.com,
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.680]   you're joining a global community.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.320]   You can, people at WordPress, you get,
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.080]   there's a front page, people follow you there.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.320]   Plus, they do all the hard work.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.560]   They keep WordPress up to date.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.720]   They keep the plugins up to date.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.640]   They have hundreds of great templates.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.560]   I used to run my own WordPress man.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.360]   I am so glad I moved to WordPress.com.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.200]   It's so much easier.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.120]   And by the way, it's a lot of expensive than when I was paying
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.520]   to run my own server and do my own support and all of that stuff.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.560]   WordPress.com, it gives you the freedom and flexibility
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.400]   to share your voice.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.720]   Yeah, you know, it's okay to have a Facebook page
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.600]   and a Twitter account.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.040]   It's okay to post on Instagram, but you really need one place.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.520]   That's your place that you own, that you live on.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.640]   That's your site at WordPress.com.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.640]   You need support, Everett.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.720]   Their customer support team is really great,
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.360]   really smart, fast to respond.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   And they're there 24/7 Monday through Friday, weekends too.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.840]   If you want to sell, I mean, I use it for my personal blog,
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.680]   but you want to put your business on there and sell.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.120]   They have great e-commerce options,
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.280]   everything from a simple and effective buy button
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.800]   to a complete online store.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.920]   And plans start as low as $4 a month.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.840]   And of course, they have all of the things you need,
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.080]   SEO automatically, social sharing, which is great.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.080]   Your readers can spread the word about your business
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.800]   or personal life or whatever it is they're sharing
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.360]   on their Twitter and on their Facebook.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.440]   They've got plugins for all you got.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.600]   I use the Google AMP plugin.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.120]   I've got HTTPS turned on.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.720]   It's got everything you want.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.720]   It's affordable.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.560]   It's easy.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.400]   It's fast.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.240]   Focus on the content.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.080]   Focus on your business.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.440]   Focus on doing what you do.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.080]   Let WordPress.com handle the rest.

[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.640]   of the show, but really, they're making my life easier.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.720]   You gotta have your own site.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   So Apple a year ago, yeah, we're changing the course
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.640]   to the stream.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.960]   Is that why you said?
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.840]   There's so much that's interesting and awesome
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.280]   to talk about with Apple this week.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.600]   You're talking about how you didn't want to talk
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.440]   about politics.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.280]   I'm excited.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.560]   We're about to talk about changing chip architecture
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.760]   for an entire operating system.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.760]   That is interesting.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.080]   All right, let's start with that one.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.960]   The Mark Berman said that Apple by 2020
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.720]   will be making its own chips for everything,
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.080]   including its Macintosh computers,
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.880]   Intel outside.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.280]   Intel stock plummeted, even though funnily enough,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.240]   there really was no reason,
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.680]   because Apple's only about 5% of Intel's business.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.880]   But what does it mean if Apple does its own chips?
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.720]   How does that change?
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.480]   I guess what does it mean is what investors
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.520]   were freaking out about,
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.600]   because there is a potential future where it's not just Mac,
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.520]   but Windows, which has experimented with ARM-based--
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.880]   I have a Windows on ARM laptop.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.440]   And they're good, but I have.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.760]   Potentially a future where Intel,
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.520]   which holds what, like 99% of the PC market right now,
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.200]   not including tablets, is like,
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.320]   they might lose hold of that,
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.480]   and that's a scary thought.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.320]   I mean, they've gotten basically nowhere in mobile.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.440]   So they have servers and they have PCs.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.920]   I think this is Intel's fault,
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.000]   because, and I think Apple,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.400]   one of the thing Apple's is saying with this is,
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.280]   you guys haven't innovated in years.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.000]   They can't make a 10 nanometer processor
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.880]   to save their life.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.320]   Qualcomm's doing it, Samsung's doing it.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.800]   They really, I mean, yeah,
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.920]   there's a seventh, eighth, and ninth generation Intel chips,
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:51.080]   but are there, is there's not much difference between them?
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.440]   I think Apple wants to make,
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.000]   wants to go more in this direction.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.680]   I have one of the original for a few years ago,
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.680]   MacBook, which is like super thin
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.840]   and only has one port on it, which is annoying.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.680]   He's holding it up with his pinky.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.360]   It's super light.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.440]   It is, you just get extremely slow.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.600]   Because the Intel chip, the best they got.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.760]   That's a poor internet there, yeah.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.000]   It's a computing model, which is increasingly lightweight
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.840]   and mobile.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.840]   It's a thin client.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.920]   Do you think of it that way?
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   Yeah, thank you for the results.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   Those are looking more--
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.320]   You're still using it, right?
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.680]   I mean, you're living with a slow,
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.040]   but if you could be faster, you'd be happy.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.920]   Yeah, I mean, I like the form,
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.360]   but it's noticeably slow.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.480]   It's slower than an iPad.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.880]   So, can I ask, is that the first generation 12-inch MacBook?
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.720]   Yes.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.960]   I'm not even sure if they've updated it since then.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.960]   No, they have.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.200]   I have the third generation,
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.600]   because I just replaced yours this year
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.080]   with the modern one.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.680]   It is much, much, much better.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.320]   It's so good, I can use it as my primary machine.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.760]   It's a battery life.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760]   It's great.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.560]   It's fantastic.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.360]   You know, my problem really is the keyboard.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.440]   It's not the battery life.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.120]   The keyboard is a lot better, too.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.800]   They made it so it gives you--
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.640]   It's not as good as the old traditional keyboard,
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.840]   but it feels a lot more clicky
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.600]   and gives you more haptic feedback.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.120]   So, I would really say give that computer another chance.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:16.960]   They're now--
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.960]   Because they're now drastically better.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   Yours has an M3.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.640]   That's all they offered the first generation.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.520]   Then they start putting i5s and i7s.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.760]   There's still low power i5s and i7s,
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.880]   but I think they probably are a lot faster.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.880]   14 anime.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.920]   Up to 3.6 gigahertz turbo boost.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.040]   I don't know if they ever get there,
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.280]   because of thermal constraints, but it's there.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.840]   If you want--
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.240]   Don't run civilization.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.920]   I mean, you know, that's pretty good.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.920]   So--
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.200]   But will they run crisis?
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.360]   That's the real issue.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:44.920]   All right.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.440]   All right.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.640]   So Apple, though, I think Apple also--
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.280]   It's not merely that Intel isn't innovating.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.400]   It's that Apple wants to own their own future, right?
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.920]   That they--
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.800]   It was Alan Kay who said, if you really care about software,
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.520]   you'll make the hardware.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.880]   They also want to lessen the load on developers, I think.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.360]   They've been aspiring to get to this place
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.480]   where developers can make on essentially one
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.120]   set of tools and not have to code something with a Mac
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.840]   architecture in mind and then one with an iOS architecture
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.240]   in mind.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.840]   And they want compilers that'll make one app that can kind
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.480]   of live on in all worlds.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.120]   Marks upon.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.800]   But I'm a developer.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   I've got to push back on that quite a bit.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.400]   Go ahead.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.600]   And I'm not saying one UI, but they--
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:32.960]   Sure.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.480]   So this is--
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   It was--
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.920]   --the language Apple has already said--
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.320]   and I think we know this-- that they want to make iOS
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.600]   apps run on Mac OS.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.320]   Oh, it's like the Universal Windows platform.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:41.820]   Right.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.080]   It's basically the same idea.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.120]   This is Project Mardzipon.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.680]   And supposedly, we're going to start--
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.120]   we'll see it in June at WWDC if they're really serious about this.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.560]   But I think even more than that--
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.400]   and I think this is why they want to abandon Intel.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.440]   I think ultimately-- and I have another story that
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.840]   will prove my point--
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.080]   Apple is, in fact, moving away from Mac OS--
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.800]   that Apple wants your next MacBook to be running iOS.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.080]   Or an operating system that can handle both--
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:09.840]   I don't know.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.040]   No, no, no.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:11.520]   I think--
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.320]   So do you think that--
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   Do you think that Apple--
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.920]   Do you think that Apple is basically
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.240]   trying to train people to think of computing
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.320]   as a mobile-first fluid experience across a phone--
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.720]   What's a computer, Lisa?
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.400]   That's the-- yeah, that's where I'm getting at.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.520]   What's a computer?
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.440]   Is do you think that they're trying to train their user base
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.760]   to think of computing as simply the information flow
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.480]   tasks that you do on a phone or a tablet
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.080]   and occasionally on a laptop?
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.440]   I mean, do you think that's really going?
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.480]   Well, here's Apple's problem.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.520]   And Brianna, maybe you can address this.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.840]   I think Apple's willing to--
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.600]   and we're going to get to this next story about what
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.680]   they're doing with the Mac Pro.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.600]   But I think Apple's willing to seed the professional community.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.800]   They don't like it because it's really important to them.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.200]   The filmmakers, the music makers.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.920]   But one thing, even if they try to save that or lose that,
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.240]   they can't lose its developers.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.280]   They need developers.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.320]   And right now, development means Mac OS.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.760]   I guess-- I mean, Apple doesn't want you writing stuff
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.280]   for iOS on Windows.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.440]   They've got to have some way to develop for iOS.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.720]   Right now, that means Mac OS.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.560]   But here's-- if I'm Apple, my number one priority at this point
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:19.320]   is getting Xcode to run on iOS to create
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.640]   a credible developer platform.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.160]   Absolutely.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.400]   I don't know what that looks like.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.760]   Maybe it looks like a thin client connected to servers.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.280]   I don't know what that looks like.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.160]   Leo, I have so much to say about this
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.040]   because it is the absolute worst thing you're ever going to do
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.280]   to try to develop an iOS app and then to try
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.640]   to do the certificate signing on a Mac
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.320]   and then moving them back and forth.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.160]   It's terrible.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.480]   But there's so much to unpack in this story
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.560]   with chip architecture and specifically graphics
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.080]   technologies.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.840]   So let's look at this.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.960]   Mac OS has long been criticized for its poor implementation
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.880]   of OpenGL.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.240]   It's absolutely terrible.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.120]   This is one of your specialties.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.880]   This is what I do for a living for.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.040]   I was doing politics.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.240]   And OpenGL is so bad on Macintosh.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.440]   It's so thick.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.720]   It is inefficient.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.760]   It is at least 25% worse.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.200]   It's why games suck.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.520]   It's why all of that just--
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:19.040]   and the only company really credibly translating mainstream
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:24.520]   games from X86 over to Mac OS, it's a spire.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.120]   And they have the most brilliant people in the entire world
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.360]   that will put it through a translation layer.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.920]   And it will work, but still got a performance hit.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.920]   So--
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.000]   And everybody who plays games on Macintosh,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.840]   A knows a spire.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.360]   And B knows that's not what you want to PC.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.280]   You want a PC.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.920]   It's why so many people use bootcamp on a Mac, which
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.360]   won't be possible, by the way, if they move over to doing
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.920]   an A9 chip or, I guess, an A20 chip in the Mac.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.720]   There's a lot to think about here,
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.200]   because every single app on Mac will
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.480]   have to be rewritten.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.880]   And I'm sure they'll have some translation wrapper
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.560]   or something to ease it over.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.200]   People forget that up until--
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.800]   They did this before, though.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.880]   They did this before.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.040]   They had Rosetta Stone.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:11.760]   They had Carba.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.760]   Rosetta until Snow Leopard.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.400]   And you could run both of them at the same time.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:20.480]   But I think in 2018, it's time I am
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:24.400]   willing to let Intel go on the Mac,
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.480]   because I think we've hoped for this future where
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.400]   Apple was going to fix OpenGL and the graphics technologies,
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.640]   enough to make it viable.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.400]   What about metal?
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.160]   Does metal solve this?
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.360]   Well, I think this is the advantage, right?
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.120]   Because if you start saying, OK, look,
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.480]   if you develop with metal, then these
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.320]   are the platforms you can use Metal on.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.080]   You can do it on Apple TV.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.320]   You can do it on iOS.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.000]   You can do it on iPads.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.960]   And you can do it on the Mac.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:56.080]   That is the point where me not using something more universal,
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.640]   like OpenGL, and saying, OK, I'm
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:04.080]   going to commit to using Metal as my graphical APIs.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.840]   That's a point where it makes sense.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.240]   Can you use Metal on a Mac now?
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.320]   You can, can't you?
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.320]   You can't say it correctly.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.440]   But why would I do that?
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.800]   Because the market share on a Mac is so low compared
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.560]   to the market share over on PC.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.120]   That's another problem entirely.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:20.600]   Right.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.120]   Exactly.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.200]   But it ties to why Apple's strategy is changing.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.360]   If you look at how much money they make on iOS,
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:29.120]   compared to how much money they make, Mac OS, any normal company,
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.280]   if it didn't have history, it didn't have--
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.960]   maybe it wasn't a little bit sentimental, would just say,
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.960]   well, let's get rid of that Mac OS division.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.440]   That's just slowing us down.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.120]   That's Edwin, baby.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.400]   Get rid of that.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.360]   But again, you need it for developers.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:43.800]   You do.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.680]   So if I am Apple, is this solvable?
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:52.280]   Could you-- is it crazy talk to say, dump Mac OS as soon
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.480]   as you get Xcode on iOS, create some sort of power iOS tool?
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.800]   Maybe it looks like a MacBook.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.880]   I don't know what it looks like.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.400]   Maybe it looks like a 30-inch tablet.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.640]   Maybe it looks like the Surface Studio.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.160]   I don't know.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.680]   I doubt that.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.880]   But make some power tool for developers that's Mac OS.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.120]   And just get rid of--
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.960]   I mean, iOS and get rid of Mac OS.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.720]   Is that not-- is that insane?
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.000]   I mean, I hope they don't do it because I love Mac.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:18.500]   Sentiment.
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.000]   That's so much.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:19.840]   That's sentiment.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.340]   Me too.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.240]   But that's sentiment.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:27.680]   That's just pure nostalgia.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.920]   I've tried to make an iPad Pro work for a main computer.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.320]   And I bring it with me when I travel
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.880]   and when I do professional speeches.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.320]   Sometimes I run keynote from it.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.240]   But when it comes to multiple windows,
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.480]   just a Mac has more power.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.000]   The email has more power.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.240]   So I think that just--
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.680]   But that's going to change.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.400]   I just want to--
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.800]   It's been 80 years now.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.480]   All right.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.320]   All right.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.400]   Now, here's what Apple says.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:01.480]   A year ago, they brought in five team Mac journalists,
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.960]   Apple journalists.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.920]   No, they weren't all team.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.280]   Enafried is not team.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.240]   But they brought in five journalists,
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.600]   and they did the apology tour.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.360]   They said, we created the Mac Pro, the trash can Mac,
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.720]   the beautiful, beautiful work of art.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:19.640]   Innovation can't innovate my ass, said Phil Schiller.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.720]   This is innovation.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:25.560]   But, oops, the thermals mean we can't upgrade it.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.800]   It's a dead end product.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.520]   It's a dead end product.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.920]   It's a dead end product.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.120]   So that was a year ago.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.160]   And then they said at that time, but we're going to work on it.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.480]   We're not abandoning the Mac Pro.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.160]   We're making a new Mac Pro, but it won't be available this year.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.800]   Matthew Panzareno, one of the five last year,
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.720]   went back to Apple this week.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.240]   And Apple said, not this year.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.640]   2019.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:56.200]   And they showed him, they showed him behind the curtain
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.560]   how they're doing it.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.600]   They apparently, this is so Apple.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.160]   They don't, you know, secrecy is so,
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.200]   and I think this hurts Apple.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.960]   Secrecy is so high at Apple that they don't want to go
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.160]   to the outside world and say, well, how do you work?
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.040]   They brought in, they hired people who make music
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:17.400]   and make video, and they put them in little rooms,
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.960]   and they watched them, and they're doing the Mac Pro line
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.280]   along with the software, the Pro software.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.480]   So logic and final cut.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.840]   And those teams are together, and they're trying to develop
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:34.000]   a hardware software combination for next year
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.080]   that will make pros happy.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.880]   So this is Apple saying, no, no, we love the Macintosh.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.760]   I will point out that Apple said, no, no,
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.440]   we love the Apple to, right up to the day,
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.000]   the Macintosh started selling, and then they can,
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.440]   that's it, bye bye.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.520]   So Apple's very good.
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:52.680]   I mean, this is one of their skills.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.240]   They're very good at abandoning the past,
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.360]   and I think that that's probably what's gonna happen.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:01.480]   But they are saying, in 2019, it's gonna be a modular product,
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.920]   which is what pros want.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.000]   We want the G's greater back.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   We have a pro workflow team that we are inside the building
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.600]   that is working with the designers of the hardware,
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.360]   as well as the designers of the software,
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:19.640]   to make something that professionals will love.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.400]   That'll be modular, powerful.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   Does this make everybody happy?
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.280]   I think one of the reasons they did this
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.000]   is because they wanted pros to say,
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.640]   okay, I'll buy the Mac Pro, I can't wait till next year.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.400]   I think some of this was just to save the iMac Pro.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.800]   - Yeah, but Leo, don't you see how this is fun to make
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.800]   and mentally at odds with the chip story
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.080]   that we just talked about? - Thank you.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.800]   - So let's break this down, okay?
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.880]   As far as professional things we can do on a Mac,
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.720]   let's say you do graphic design, Photoshop.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:58.240]   You know, an iMac, a MacBook Pro
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.080]   really will genuinely meet your needs for that.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.840]   You don't need more power than that.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.840]   It's nice to have, but you're in the realm of things you can do.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.600]   Logic, exact same situation.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.400]   Like more power is gonna help you,
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.560]   but like a lot of parallel processing,
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.040]   it's just not needed there.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.800]   What other applications are there?
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   Video editing, again, I think if you look at the current iMac Pro,
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.960]   I think it's very hard to see even with 4K workflows
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.880]   why you would need more power than.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.000]   So what is left?
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.200]   3D is left at that point.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:39.200]   3D work, professional like VFX for movies or game development.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:45.640]   And my message to you is if you're moving away from X86,
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.520]   you are throwing that entire market away.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.160]   It cannot be used.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.600]   You will not have Nuke on your platform.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.400]   You will not have Maya.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.880]   You won't have 3DS Max.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:00.600]   Unreal Engine, there's no way they're gonna port that over
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:03.040]   to like an Apple specific chip.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.520]   So I appreciate like this marketing message
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.440]   that they're bringing out,
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:11.360]   but these two stories are completely incompatible.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.080]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.400]   - That's exactly my reaction to this.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.800]   Is this is two different, completely different ideas.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.000]   - Well, the chip transition is gonna happen in phases.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.440]   It's gonna start almost certainly with consumer devices
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.080]   with the low end laptops,
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.560]   which are on a unit basis by far their largest sellers.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.400]   - Right.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.760]   - The iMacs and the Mac Pros could continue to exist
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.920]   for years after the transition begins.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.880]   - I guess it makes sense if Apple thinks there's two,
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.720]   Apple has two goals.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.120]   One is we gotta keep developers making stuff.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.000]   And I don't think it's games by the way, Brianna,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.280]   but we just gotta keep people writing stuff for iOS.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.120]   - Apps.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.000]   - Apps.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.840]   And then two, we for sentimental reasons,
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.440]   but also somewhat practical reasons
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.480]   want creative professionals to still love Macs.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.800]   They did for years, right?
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.280]   That relationships only started going south
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.440]   a couple of years ago.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.880]   We want them to still love Macintosh
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.880]   because it adds cache to the platform.
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.320]   It makes it a hip platform.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.840]   I mean, there's lots of, I don't know,
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.960]   kind of soft reasons that you might wanna keep that market.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.840]   So what if they did make a Mac Pro?
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.000]   It was just completely a dead end in the business model, right?
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.200]   It's just gonna keep making that out there
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.480]   'cause there's a thousand people that will buy it.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.360]   And then put everything else into iOS.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.960]   But they keep the Mac alive just because security updates.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.680]   And I mean, what have they been doing for the last like four,
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.520]   five years?
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.360]   - They haven't been doing much.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.200]   Look at the Mac mini.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   I own a 2013 trash can.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.280]   Beautiful cylinder.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.160]   Actually, I don't, I gave it to Nathan.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.320]   - That's right.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.480]   - I gave my Mac Pro to Nathan Oliver as Giles,
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.760]   who probably has no well on that.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.240]   - Yeah, he probably has no use for it either.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.800]   But it was a doorstop.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.080]   That's why I gave it to him.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.080]   So very high priced doorstop.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.120]   That hasn't been updated.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.800]   If you go to the page, it's the same Mac Pro.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.360]   I bought in 2013.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.320]   That's unconscionable.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.160]   - Yeah.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:03.760]   - Now, actions speak louder than words in that case.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:06.080]   You can say, oh, we got these people in this.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.360]   Look at all the people and they're working hard
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.200]   to make a new Mac Pro.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.360]   But where's the Mac mini?
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.880]   What's happening with the Mac Pro?
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:20.880]   Why are laptops getting more and more like iOS devices?
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   Right?
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.640]   They don't, they say we're never going to do touch on a Mac laptop.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.440]   But the market wants touch.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:27.520]   Just ask Microsoft.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.920]   The market wants touch.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.280]   This should be an iPad.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.800]   This Surface Studio.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   This shouldn't be a Windows device.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.680]   And the way I use it, the way I want to use it
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.920]   is work perfectly with an iPad for illustrating,
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.640]   zooming in, doing the kind of stuff.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.640]   - So Microsoft has this phrase they like to bring up
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:49.000]   called the five generation workplace.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.440]   Where what they point out is that as of right now,
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.880]   we have five distinct technological cohorts
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.400]   in the workplace from people in the early 20s,
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.000]   all the way up to people in their 60s and 70s.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.960]   And the argument is that--
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.000]   - I'm that guy in the 60s and 70s.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   - But the argument--
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.160]   - That's a really depressing cohort.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.800]   - But the argument is that you thought,
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.840]   but the argument is that the technology that enters
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.360]   the workplace is the technology that people have been using
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360]   in schools.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.200]   - They think that 60 year olds want to use--
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.480]   - And that people are cultured to.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.120]   - Windows.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.040]   - And this is why when you take a look at office suites
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.840]   and things like that, they now offer a tremendous amount
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.440]   of collaboration because this is what people have been using
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.040]   through university.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.360]   They've been using a manager's social life to manage information,
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.960]   flow to manage files, things like that.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.080]   And the same thing goes for computer hardware.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.440]   If you are a young adult who has grown up on tablets
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   and phones and things like that, you seem--
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.440]   Well, there should be in your mind,
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.840]   why would you not want a computing experience
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.760]   where you can basically do everything you need to do
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.320]   that you can do on a mobile device?
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.560]   - That's what you grew up with.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.440]   And frankly, that's the future, isn't it?
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440]   - Yeah.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.040]   - Oh, I don't argue that this is a whole different topic,
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.400]   but the future is less keyboard because you're talking
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.200]   earlier about keyboards.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.880]   And I kept thinking that's going to be something
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.880]   that I don't think matters to users in 15 years.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.400]   - See that?
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.160]   - Or matters to you.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.080]   - Let's argue about that because I find--
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080]   Boy, oh boy.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.480]   - Somebody in the studio just went, oh.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.280]   - I mean, really?
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.880]   Do you think--
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.360]   I mean, you think we won't be--
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.440]   How are you going to write your articles?
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.640]   - Voice.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.200]   - Really?
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.600]   - Yeah.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.000]   - No, Mark, you're not writing your articles with speaking.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.840]   - No, I mean--
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.760]   - You're a young person.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:26.760]   - Yeah.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.560]   - Did you win in a college in high school?
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.760]   You didn't have tablets yet.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.120]   - Yeah.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.040]   - No tablets, no tablets.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.080]   - I mean, you're also assuming--
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.600]   you're also assuming because you talked about writing
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.160]   articles and pros and things like that,
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.800]   but we're also looking at media channels that are becoming
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.520]   increasingly more image or video or audio based too.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.320]   - You know, it's funny though.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.880]   - So that's a completely different way of presenting context.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.000]   - Maybe they're outliers, but I have a 26 year old
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.360]   and a 23 year old.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.920]   I keep trying to give them an iPad.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.400]   - Yeah.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.560]   - They don't want it.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.080]   (laughs)
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.080]   - Abby, who's 26, uses a Chromebook.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.800]   - Chromebooks are huge.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.640]   - My daughter.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.480]   - In schools right now.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.720]   - My daughter, who is seven, is on a Chromebook.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.560]   And--
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.640]   - I think you need a keyboard.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.480]   I don't think you--
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.320]   - No, she's--
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.560]   - I don't think typing is gonna go away that quick.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.480]   - No, watching her maneuver, 'cause she's just learning
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.160]   a little bit of keyboarding now, but again, she's seven,
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.280]   she's first grade.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.960]   And for her--
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.640]   - It's all touch.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.040]   - It's touch, orth arrow keys.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.720]   And bearing in mind, this is a kid who's just learning
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.120]   how to read it and just reading now.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.400]   So there's a lot of work for keyboarding
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.080]   and I don't think they get into it until after
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.880]   they learn cursive in my kids' hippie school,
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.720]   which is fine.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.640]   - Why do they look okay?
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.480]   - But the point is--
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.840]   - Where's the keeping keyboards around,
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.960]   keeping cursive around?
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   - No, there's actually, there are actually studies
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.320]   that show that writing things out and using cursive
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.560]   is a way to help information processing and retention.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.480]   And it's actually underscoring some of the--
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.320]   - So that's in schools?
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.160]   - Mind-abiding connection and we're seeing you
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.520]   from some school students.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:49.040]   - So it pulled out this research for the Apple Education
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.680]   event in Chicago, the market breakdown
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.680]   in American schools, 60% Android or Chromebook.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.120]   - Android.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.160]   - Now, and if you have a Google software--
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.000]   - No Google, right.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   - 60% Windows, 22%, Apple, 17%.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.400]   - That's why Apple had an education event,
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.640]   but their entire education event was basically,
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.040]   we love education, now buy more iPads.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.920]   - Yeah, but to get back to the Google thing,
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.360]   one of the things that I've noticed with my nephews,
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.520]   our teenagers, my niece is now in college,
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.880]   they grew up on Google Apps,
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.000]   and that's what they use in school.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.240]   Their teacher threw, used to throw the assignments
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.680]   into a Google Doc, it was all collaborative,
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.880]   you could see the teachers notes,
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.080]   you could see their classmates and us,
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.160]   they did all their group projects that way,
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.640]   and they see no reason to switch to Microsoft
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.200]   in the workplace, because they're like,
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.160]   I already know how to do this,
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.760]   I already have workflow that works for me.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:41.600]   - You know what's kind of interesting?
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.360]   - And that's how I have to,
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.440]   Lisa, I have to say is I've talked to so many school districts
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.080]   is because they're underfunded.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.760]   - That's why they do it, you know, it's true.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.440]   - But I don't want, and I would lobby you, Christina,
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.880]   I mean, Nabriana, if you were our member of Congress,
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.680]   I would lobby you and say,
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:02.800]   we really don't want a closed proprietary solution
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.080]   in our schools.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.520]   Schools should not be investing
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.120]   in a proprietary Apple ecosystem,
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.080]   they should be investing in an open ecosystem.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.520]   Google's much more open,
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.840]   but I think that's really important,
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.160]   I think public schools,
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.680]   I don't care what private schools do,
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.000]   but public schools should support open.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.240]   Should they?
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.200]   - I think, I have so much to say about this,
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.880]   I think government as a whole
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.800]   should always be developing free and open source software
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.400]   by default. - Yes, yes.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.520]   - Because we're the taxpayers, we are paying for it,
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.480]   and if someone can take that code and reuse it,
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.800]   great, in addition, better security,
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.560]   you know, it's open, we can look at it for holes,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.560]   we can find out what the problems are.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.840]   What I see going on in school districts
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.920]   is so unconscionable right now.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.680]   It is so wasteful because every single school district
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.800]   will have some vendor that they will have to pay
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.960]   to bring in some specialized software
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.320]   for their database and their, you know,
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.840]   all of it is just a swindle, it's a swindle.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.560]   What I wanna do is to develop like,
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.720]   I want to have like a billion dollar
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.000]   free and open source system for the basic stuff,
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.760]   schools and hospitals, other like civic infrastructures do,
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:22.000]   like databases for student with rock solid cybersecurity,
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.560]   class collaboration stuff.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.320]   There's no way we can't program this
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:30.360]   and we can create millions and millions of dollars
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.320]   worth of jobs if we do this.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.280]   So I think we need a complete paradigm shift.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.440]   I love Microsoft, I think they're probably one
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.600]   of the better companies in tech today,
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.480]   but I do think it's not a good deal for the public schools
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:47.560]   to continually get locked into these contracts with Windows.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.600]   - Or Mac or any other proprietors.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.600]   - Absolutely.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.000]   - Absolutely.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:52.840]   - All right, let's take a break.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.400]   I hope you're not, I wanna talk more about Apple.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.480]   We got lots more to talk about.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:56.400]   We've got a great panel.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.960]   Brianna Wu is here.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.640]   You just heard a little bit of her stump speech
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.360]   candidate for US Congress in the Massachusetts Ape.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.680]   Brianna Wu 2018.com, which as we speak is being de-dossed.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.520]   - That's true.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.720]   - Sorry.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.720]   - Yep, it sucks.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.920]   - What the hell?
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.680]   You think it's Russians?
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.640]   - I don't, yeah.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.280]   So the alt-right has found a lot of ways to--
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.920]   - They don't like you, do they?
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.760]   - We're not friends, we're not friends.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.600]   They've actually gone and in different countries filed
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.360]   claims against our domains.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.760]   So I'm trying to talk to people in French
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.920]   getting control of my own domains back.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.280]   Like it has just been a--
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.200]   - They're nightmare, they're really bad people.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.240]   I don't know where these people came from.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.160]   But there's no moral compass at all.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.880]   And is there a nexus?
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.120]   There's a nexus between this and gamer gate.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.880]   - Oh yeah, same people.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.080]   - Something wrong with those people.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.920]   I wish I knew what it was, which I could fix them.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.840]   You're broken.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.800]   Anyway, thank you Brianna.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.760]   - I kinda wanna ring a tell where you just say you're broken.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.600]   - You're broken.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.800]   - Yeah.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.560]   - Any of the hug.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.480]   - Well, but fortunately we have people who are so brave.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.520]   I just wanna give you credit.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.040]   I mean, you're so brave.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.240]   In your shoes, I would have just
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.960]   have disappeared from the face of the earth.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.480]   I would be somewhere no one could find me.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.760]   But instead with the opposite direction,
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.920]   you went somewhere, everybody could find you and,
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.440]   gosh darn it, I applaud you.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.600]   That's talk about civic duty and serving.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.520]   That is a big deal.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.360]   Thank you.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.760]   - We really, really need people
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.040]   to understand technology, making policy.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.000]   It has never been more important.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.760]   And I think I really feel like technologists have a,
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.840]   like patriotism is something,
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.040]   it's not a word you can use sincerely,
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.440]   but I really believe this.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.360]   - I use it sincerely now.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.880]   - If you love this country and you're a technologist,
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.160]   I think you need to think about your civic duty
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.160]   and consider serving.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.480]   I genuinely believe that.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.080]   - I couldn't agree more.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.600]   And women, look at, there are more women now running
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.040]   for Congress than men.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.000]   - Absolutely.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   - Absolutely.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.920]   - This is such a sea change.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.000]   And it's because I think we love this country
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.320]   and we want to stand up in this country
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.520]   and we want to make it right.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.280]   So thank you, Brianna, for being so brave.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.120]   Wow.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:14.120]   Lisa Schmeiser is also brave for other reasons.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.080]   She said, she's right about Windows, that's brave.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.840]   IT pro today.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.720]   No, editor there, no, I'm teasing you.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.360]   But aren't you, isn't your heart with a Mac?
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.400]   Let's tell the truth.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   - So I will say as a user,
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.320]   I'm locked into the Apple ecosystem,
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.160]   have been for quite some time.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.080]   - Hey, you're wearing an Apple watch,
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:32.920]   you're using a Mac?
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:33.760]   - I am, it's true.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.840]   - You're drinking that new weird Coke light.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.960]   - You know, I almost never drink stuff
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.080]   with Aspartame in it.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.280]   - No, this is Stevia.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.840]   This is like even better.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.680]   This is the new--
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.000]   - Then my ban on Aspartame continues.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.840]   - Well, it might have some Aspartame.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.480]   - No, but to get back to the Microsoft question.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.320]   - That's right.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.160]   - Yes, it does.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.480]   (laughing)
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.320]   Damn you, Aspartame.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.640]   - My brain, it's melting.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.840]   - I think Microsoft as a company
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.040]   is one of the most interesting stories
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.080]   over the past few years.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.080]   - I completely agree.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.440]   In fact, we're gonna talk about the demotion,
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.600]   the demotion of Windows in just a second.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.800]   - The demotion has been going on for quite some time,
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.640]   and we'll talk about it more.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.480]   But yeah, I--
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.400]   - It's much to say, in a way,
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.480]   it's very similar to this Apple conversation.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.400]   Companies, these mainline companies,
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.600]   are really dealing with--
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.960]   - Well, we're at an inflection point.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.200]   - A huge change in the world.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.400]   - We're at an inflection point where you think about it
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.280]   through the 70s and 80s, what we did
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.200]   is we normalized tech in the workplace,
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.760]   and we normalized the idea of automation
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.000]   as being a component of people's jobs,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.560]   and redirecting human energies
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.680]   compared to things you could have a computer to.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.080]   We've hit the end stage of that development,
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.400]   and all of these companies are now writing
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.720]   what they think the next stage looks like.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.360]   Apple has one particular vision.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.320]   Microsoft has a particular vision.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.960]   IBM has a particular vision,
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.920]   and it's interesting to see how companies
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:57.440]   are moving their internal resources into place,
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.880]   and then positioning their products
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.680]   towards their existing customers,
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.120]   and the customers they hope to attract.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.120]   - I'm kind of with Mark Millian here though,
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.720]   on this that these companies are right to think
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.600]   that at any moment they could be displaced.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.160]   That's one of the natures of technology,
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.360]   and the anti-grove always said only the paranoid survive.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.960]   He's the CEO of Intel.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.000]   Intel could have used a little more paranoia.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.160]   I just wanna say, competition is good, right?
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.440]   - That's for sure. - Mark Millian's here.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.280]   He's from Bloomberg.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.400]   He writes about all this stuff.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.560]   He's a technology editor there at Mark Millian on Twitter.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.480]   I don't wanna make you hungry.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.840]   I show you what I made last night.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.680]   Oh, this is so good.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.560]   This is my blue apron.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.200]   I know you like blue apron.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.360]   I hear, I hear, I hear,
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.520]   Simone raving. - Look at this.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.560]   This is what I'm making.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.840]   - Oh look. - Right here.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.400]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.280]   - Blue apron. - I love blue apron.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.320]   - We love it. - We love it.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.440]   - So, blue apron is the number one
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.160]   fresh ingredient recipe delivery service in the country.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.360]   You get a blue apron box.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.080]   You get ours once a week with three meals in it.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.000]   Three different meals for a family.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.520]   I've never seen better produce, vegetables and meats.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.360]   They have some magics that really has made them the king here
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.280]   where everything is beautiful and perfect.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.320]   If not, they'll make it good.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.480]   But it always is.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.520]   And they use ingredients that you're unique and fabulous.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.640]   Here's how it works.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.840]   You're gonna go to the blue,
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.280]   I make up my mouth's watering.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.560]   You're gonna go to the blue apron's site
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.720]   every week, 12 new recipes.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.720]   Each of them can be cooked in under 45 minutes
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.720]   depending on your subscription.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.960]   You pick two, three or four recipes.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.080]   Based on what fits your schedule,
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.600]   non-GMO ingredients meet with no added hormones.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.440]   They're really working on a sustainable food system.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.560]   They, so this is what we made the other night.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.640]   This is seared steaks with lemon,
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.160]   Parmesan kale and roasted potatoes.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.120]   We made it to the steaks cause our 15 year old really,
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.760]   he doesn't like,
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.680]   blue apron is some wonderful exotic Asian inspired meals.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.200]   All sorts of really interesting meals.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.720]   But he's pretty basic.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.120]   So we made the steak.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.040]   He ate the steak and the delicious roasted potatoes.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.000]   But we made, I got this kale recipe,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.840]   blew me away, I'm gonna make this again and again and again.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.120]   - I have that too, Leo.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:07.960]   It was so good.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.040]   - Is it good with a little fresh cream and some lemon?
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:11.880]   - Oh, it's amazing.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.240]   - Oh, and a little garlic?
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.840]   I've never had better kale in my life.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.520]   So that's what happens with blue apron.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.120]   You get this meal and you make this meal
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.880]   and you serve it in the house smells great.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.200]   If you can get the kids to help,
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.560]   it turns them on to the idea that cooking a meal
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.640]   is better than going to fast food.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.760]   So that's really a win.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.520]   But then also, you always have exactly the right ingredients,
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.760]   not too much, not too little.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.960]   So there's never any waste.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.240]   If you need a clove of garlic, you get a clove of garlic.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.400]   If you need a little bit of soy sauce,
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.760]   you get a little bit of soy sauce.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.080]   It's always just the right amount.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.840]   And actually that makes it a little easier to cook too,
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:42.680]   cause you know,
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:43.720]   if at the end of the recipe,
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.160]   you haven't used it all, you missed something.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.960]   I, this blew me away.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.640]   And that's what happens is,
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.920]   so you make the meal, you eat the meal,
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.640]   but then every time I get a new ingredient,
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.440]   new idea, a new way of cooking,
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.120]   that I will make again and again and again.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.760]   Now, Blue Wape doesn't repeat these recipe items,
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.240]   these menu items more than once a year.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.400]   So you're gonna see a whole bunch of different stuff,
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.240]   but you will,
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.680]   this will add to your repertoire.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.200]   That kale I will be making again and again and again.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.800]   But they have vegetarian meals.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.960]   Here's what's on the menu this week.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.120]   How about seared salmon and lemon labna?
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.760]   I don't even know what that is with freaky.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.120]   I don't know what that is, zucchini and dates.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.600]   Sounds good though.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.080]   That's the thing is next time I'll know, all right?
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.920]   What else do we have there?
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.360]   Love, love, miso sweet potato, don't worry.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.720]   Doesn't that look good?
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.920]   So like I said, they, some of it's very exotic,
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.800]   some of it's, you know, meat and potatoes,
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.360]   you get to choose what you want.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.560]   Incredible ingredients, chef design recipes,
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.840]   exactly the amount you need.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.240]   Blue Apron lets you see that what the power food can do.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.960]   This is about bringing,
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.320]   I always think of making a meal for my family

[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.080]   And when they sit down and eat that meal
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.200]   that you made with your hands, there is nothing better.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.200]   Nothing better.

[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.160]   - Can I say one more thing here, Lea?
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.680]   They did two things this year that I love with it.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.120]   So the first thing is you can move to a family plan with it.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.760]   So something, 'cause it's harder for me personally
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.960]   campaigning to cook all the time,
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.320]   I've moved to the family plan where they give you a set of four.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.120]   So then if you're cooking, it's not just one meal
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.920]   for you and your husband.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.920]   Like you can have leftover to eat later and I love that.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.760]   And the other thing is if you're,
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.600]   you go to the app and you find out,
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.640]   "Okay, I like this, I want this this week."
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:08.680]   If like you see three or four things and you love them all,
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.920]   you can click them all and have them delivered.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:14.160]   If you only say one thing, you just click that one thing.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.920]   Or if you're going on vacation or you're gonna be off town,
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.120]   you just click like skip that week.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.840]   So they have gotten so much better this year
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.120]   at working through these like small problems with the service.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.480]   And it is just amazing to that.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.640]   - I really love it.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.640]   I'm guessing that they're probably a sponsor of Rocket.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.440]   - They are, they are, but they,
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.160]   I don't think they're sponsoring this this year.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.760]   I just, I use them because I love them.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.160]   - We love them, yep, me too.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.000]   - Yeah.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.880]   And if you're not listening to Rocket,
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.160]   Brianna and Christina Warren and Simone de Rochefort,
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.840]   who's the only person who's not been on Twitter
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.440]   that of that.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.560]   And she does the best blue apron ads.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.080]   It makes me so hungry.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:52.920]   - She's amazing.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.160]   - Simone has, she has so much talent.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.480]   (laughs)
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.600]   - It is a great geek conversation from relay.fm rocket.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.720]   That's Brianna who's fabulous podcast.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.760]   You gave, you helped me do my ad,
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.960]   I'll help you plug your fabulous podcast.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.800]   - I genuinely love it, just like you.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.960]   I'm happy to talk about it.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.800]   - Yeah, right.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.880]   It's nice to have advertisers you love.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.560]   That's kind of our model actually.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.120]   We had fun this week on Twitter.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.160]   We have a little mini movie.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:25.160]   Carsten, can you roll the film previously on Twitter?
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.520]   - I'm guessing from the name Quaker Alert 2
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.080]   that this is not your first app.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.320]   So what's new, what's different between this
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.240]   and your first Quaker Alert?
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.520]   - It's better.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.360]   - Okay, that's good.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.760]   (laughs)
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.320]   - That's so bravo.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.600]   It's new and improved.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.800]   - You know how.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.800]   - So I thought today what we might wanna do
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.040]   is give our audience some basic knowledge,
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.760]   some from soup to nuts, bare bones 101 information
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.760]   about how to start making 3D objects that can be printed
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.960]   and here, for free.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.600]   Megan, what's your thing doing?
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.920]   - My heart is flying.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.240]   (laughs)
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.400]   - Literally.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.920]   - Megan has found rotation.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.040]   What are you gonna get to?
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:04.960]   - Okay.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.040]   - This week in Google.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.840]   - I actually question your support for Facebook.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.400]   - You think for every one of the two million people
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.440]   who are on Facebook, that they are just
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.120]   thrust into the faces of Nazis every day?
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.360]   - I think they don't know what they're giving up
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.200]   to Facebook and--
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.320]   - How elitist.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.400]   How elitist.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.440]   - Did they tell you they were scanning your messages?
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.760]   - Are we just-- - Did they tell you
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.080]   they were collecting your Android call history?
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.680]   When they get caught, they apologize
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.360]   and then they go right ahead and do it.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.680]   - This is your brain.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.240]   This is your brain on Twitter.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.520]   Any questions?
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.000]   - I shouldn't have been so mad at you.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.200]   - Hold on, I'm almost to the final boss.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.560]   (laughing)
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.200]   - You were the final boss.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.840]   - That's so much COVID, as always.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.560]   - I can't believe I can pay my good friend.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.480]   - Always great for good.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.200]   We were talking before the show about Ready Player One.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.320]   You've seen that Brianna, these two have it.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.920]   And the vision of VR in Ready Player One.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.880]   But of course, the whole point in Ready Player One
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.800]   is the whole world's gonna hell.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.680]   And so, the only way, nobody can afford to go on vacation.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.880]   So the only way anybody has any fun is it.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.920]   It's in a virtual oasis.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.280]   But maybe we're headed that way, but they do have it down.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.160]   And especially in the movie,
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.040]   you gotta see the movie they've got a,
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.680]   and we actually had that on the new screen savers.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.960]   They've got one of those treadmills that goes
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.160]   in any omnidirectional treadmills.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.560]   - Oh my God. - Those exist.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.760]   They don't show this in the movie,
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.440]   but I found out, 'cause Jason Howell did it
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.160]   on the new screen savers.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.640]   You can go up to seven miles an hour, you can run.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.200]   If you can run seven miles an hour, I can't.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.040]   - I can't.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.280]   - Yeah, seven miles an hour.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.560]   But he said--
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.040]   - But it sounds like a freight train, 'cause--
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.200]   (laughing)
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.440]   - These are all the rollers and the motors.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.280]   The whole thing.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.760]   (growling)
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.800]   Anyway, that's a good movie.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.560]   I highly recommend it, right, Brianna?
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.560]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.080]   They, you know, I was, they got a bit of backlash
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.080]   from some of the leftist community.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.680]   I can say, go see the movie, put all the criticism aside.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.680]   It's, the book is not really the best written women
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.120]   you're ever going to tell.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.760]   - Oh, the book is not the best writing.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.600]   The book is-- - No.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.800]   - Now, earn his client, I love you.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.880]   And I'm, but, I mean, literally, I'm starting to count
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.600]   how many people in the book have infectious grins.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.560]   It's actually, I'm starting to get a little queasy.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.400]   - It's an epidemic.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.280]   The grins are infectious.
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.640]   - Infectious grins are everywhere.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.400]   It's one of those books where there's a lot of that.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.920]   It's not, it's not, you know, but on the other hand,
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.760]   the idea is this, that's what we read science fiction for,
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.600]   is the idea-- - It's great.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.080]   I've read that book like 20 times.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:33.920]   - Really?
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.200]   Oh, all right. - Oh yeah.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.280]   - I started it 20 times.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.800]   And the infectious grins stopped me.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.960]   - It would be interesting to see a hyperlinked version
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.880]   where you linked all the cultural reference.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.080]   - There's a ton of it.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:45.920]   What's interesting is Spielberg--
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.880]   - I think that's that big, great use of hypertext.
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.000]   - Ranch it out a little bit,
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.520]   'cause it was in the '80s in the book, right?
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:54.560]   Spielberg has more stuff from other eras.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.000]   I was really hoping that Spielberg
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.160]   would throw in some Jaws references.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.360]   I was really hoping.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.640]   - That's a little cell-founding.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.480]   - Why?
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.280]   - No, he is, I mean, Spielberg was one of the great directors
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.000]   of the '80s, right? - I mean, it's true.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.960]   - Who better direct this movie than the--
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.360]   - I did read something about how he had pledged
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.920]   not to put any of his own references in the movie.
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:13.760]   - There's some Kubrick in there.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.600]   There's a lot of it. - And then,
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.280]   supposedly, the people around him on the set were like,
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.400]   "No, you gotta put back to the future."
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.240]   - Well, that's right.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.840]   So back to the future's in there, right?
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:23.680]   Yeah, okay.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.360]   So there is a little bit of that.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.680]   - I do have to say, if I'm one--
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.440]   - He's produced it, yeah.
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.960]   - Yeah, I have two criticisms in the movie.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.600]   As a game developer, I don't understand how
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.680]   anyone could ship a game of that quality,
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.240]   keeping it secret and not having play testers.
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.800]   That's just absolutely impossible.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.280]   - Very plausible.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.800]   - But the other thing is they never explain,
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:48.440]   the core reason you can't have player one,
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.120]   Ray player one in real life right now,
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.000]   is the disconnect between your inner ear
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.360]   and what your eyes see.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.520]   So if you've ever experienced VR,
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.080]   you have to have a teleport mechanic to move around,
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:04.960]   because if it's just you running down a hallway,
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.240]   your eyes, yeah, it makes you nauseous
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.640]   'cause your eyes think you're moving forward
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:12.920]   and your ear is telling you you're standing still.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.640]   They kind of just wish that away in the book,
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:19.600]   but I would love for us to figure out how to solve that
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.640]   because then we can have that awesome universe.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.480]   So it would be great.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.520]   - In the book, and I think in the movie too,
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.520]   the visor is shooting lasers into your retina.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.040]   So it's not looking at screens.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.600]   - What they leave out, now maybe I'm missing this in the book,
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.640]   maybe Lisa, you can tell me, or Brianna,
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.840]   they talk about how the Oasis,
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.320]   which is this virtual reality game, was so popular
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.920]   'cause it was free, it was a quarter, you paid a quarter.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.840]   Which is cute 'cause it's like the video game machines
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:46.800]   and the ready player one,
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.680]   there's all these throwbacks to video game machines.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.080]   But they don't mention is, oh, and by the way,
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:57.080]   you need a laser retina visor and haptic feedback gloves.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.440]   They never mentioned--
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.480]   - How you fund those--
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.920]   - That's gonna cost like 500 bucks, at least.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:06.800]   - In the book they do have him scavenging for tech too.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.640]   - Yeah, but in order to get in the Oasis,
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.240]   you have to have at least that minimal hardware.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.920]   And they say the game is free, they don't make,
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.560]   what are they giving them free visors?
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.920]   And I don't understand that part.
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.080]   Anyway, that's--
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.640]   - Well, he finds the scavenging for tech,
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.400]   which helps him bankroll his habit.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.240]   - Right, right.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.080]   - And so--
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.040]   - All schools have moved online,
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.640]   or at least good school staff.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.480]   - That's how we got it,
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.480]   so many students get it for free.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.360]   - It was, the school provided basic Oasis gear.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.200]   - Yeah, and a basic Oasis access,
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.120]   and then he had to scrounge for the rest of it.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.480]   - So the chat room's telling me that.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.320]   - Yeah.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.160]   (laughs)
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.080]   - But what if you weren't a student?
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.640]   I mean, what if the vast majority of people
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.800]   who weren't students, how do they get it?
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.440]   - I think one of the unspoken,
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.040]   they don't get into civic policy in this world.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:52.880]   - No.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.720]   (laughs)
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.880]   - But I think one of the core assumptions
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.360]   is that somebody who is as economically disadvantaged
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.960]   as your protagonist has basic schooling,
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.640]   then there's been some sort of nationwide rollout,
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.320]   where it's distributed the same way--
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.160]   - It must be.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.000]   The government must--
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.040]   - There must be basic income,
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.160]   because a lot of these people don't seem to be working.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.000]   - Yeah.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.320]   - At all.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.000]   - Lisa, I have to fact check you on one thing.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.520]   They do get into civic policy by putting Wil Wheaton
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.200]   and Corey Doctorow in charge of all internet technology.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.640]   That is actually a line in the book.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:24.480]   - That's in the book.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.280]   - No, that is a civic kind of that part.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.120]   - Yeah.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.200]   (laughs)
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.680]   - Ernest Klein, who wrote the book,
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.320]   was a former editor at Boing Boing.
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.640]   So it's a little tip of the hat to his old buddies.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:38.160]   I'm thrilled that Ernest has done so well.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:41.320]   And I think if you wanna see a great movie,
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.800]   that's gonna be a summer film.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.840]   Maybe, oh, I don't know, maybe Infinity War.
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.880]   I don't know, we got some good movies going on.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:47.720]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:48.560]   - No.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.320]   - Well, let's see, Infinity War comes out in a couple weeks.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.160]   - Yep.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:55.880]   - Don't we have a new Ant-Man coming out this summer too?
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.960]   - Yes, there's a new Ant-Man.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:58.800]   - Yeah.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.280]   - Are you like into Ant-Man?
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.120]   - I really liked the first one.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.520]   - I did, I did.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.200]   - I better go back, I'm not up on the Ant-Man canon.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.920]   So I better watch the first Ant-Man.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.560]   - Please don't make me explain the difference
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.120]   between Hank and Scott Lang.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.600]   - It's very strange.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.160]   I saw the trailer for the new Ant-Man.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:18.200]   It is, I'm, what's going on?
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.080]   At least I had a whisper in my ear, my wife, you.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:21.920]   Had a whisper in my ear.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.240]   - The transitive property of Lisa's,
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.080]   where everywhere.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.400]   - All Lisa's whispered in my ear.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.240]   (laughing)
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.720]   It's Ant-Man.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:29.880]   I said, is he small?
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.720]   Is he big?
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.600]   What's going on?
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.360]   - In the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.000]   there's something called PIM Particles,
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.160]   which warped the laws of physics
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.680]   and allow you to go into this subatomic spaces
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:42.080]   between atoms themselves.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:45.120]   And the PIM Particles allow you to expand or contract.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:48.160]   - All right, Leah, you've got to see this.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.480]   You guys, I'm so excited about it.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.840]   - Mr. Ant-Man.
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.920]   - Oh, oh, you've got the gauntlet.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:53.760]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.600]   - I do.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.440]   - Oh, yes.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.160]   Okay, so for those of you just listening,
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:00.840]   Branna's wearing a bronze plastic glove
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.720]   that is the size of like five Brianna's.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.960]   And oh, she just broke it.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.920]   And it's got gems on it.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.360]   What's this for?
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.200]   What's that for?
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.800]   - I think it's for just looking awesome
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.800]   and walking around.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:13.640]   (laughing)
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:17.000]   - I wanna shoot like a video of me driving like my Porsche
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.200]   and like shifting the gears with this infinity gauntlet.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.480]   This is so awesome.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.600]   - What's the sound coming out of that?
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.000]   - So when you can push this button.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.200]   - Feel like a Simon Says on the Knuckles.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.480]   (laughing)
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.800]   (gasping)
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:32.640]   - Oh my God.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.720]   Oh my God.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.760]   - Please God, that's the problem.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.760]   - I'm an adult.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.640]   - So we talked a couple of weeks ago
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.800]   about the really great science fiction book,
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.720]   The Three Body Problem.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.840]   And how, who is it?
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.280]   Is Amazon?
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.800]   I think Amazon spent a billion dollars just for the rights.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.680]   Not for the production.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.440]   Just for the rights to make this trilogy.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.320]   It's a Chinese science fiction classic.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.920]   It's really good.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.120]   Okay, the money's going up a lot.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:11.480]   After battling Netflix for the rights to bring
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.400]   the Lord of the Rings to the small screen,
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.960]   Amazon has paid $250 million
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.600]   for the right to make a TV series
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.520]   they expect to spend more than a billion dollars,
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.040]   five season commitment.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.280]   It's not like we haven't seen the Lord of the Rings.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.400]   (laughing)
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:31.640]   - That's the big criticism.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:34.360]   This has already been done recently and well.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.200]   - Yeah.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.080]   - Very well.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.840]   - Did we talk about this on a previous episode
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.160]   where we're like, what stories could you possibly
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.320]   tell at this point?
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.160]   - Oh, maybe we did.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.000]   - Yeah.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.480]   'Cause I remember when this deal was first announced,
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.800]   I was on and I think we got distracted talking about
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.960]   whether this is gonna be a show all ends all the time or--
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.040]   - Well, you're right.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.760]   'Cause in November, they made the deal for it.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:54.600]   - Yeah.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.480]   - Okay, so I'm not, this is, I guess,
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.400]   an article from the Hollywood Reporter inside
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.560]   the deal that came out this week.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.680]   - Going into some of the budget.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.440]   - The budget, a billion dollars to make it.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.440]   But what this does say that is absolutely a hot topic
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:15.760]   is the change in television and the shift in power
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.000]   to Netflix and Amazon away from the traditional.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.480]   You don't even hear ABC, NBC and CBS
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.040]   talking about deals like this anymore.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:25.400]   They're not even in the game.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.880]   They're busy making reality, the Bachelor 15 and stuff.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:33.280]   This is, and it's, and Apple has also really stepped
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.080]   into this battle and they're spending a billion dollars.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.700]   This is really interesting.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.960]   - Apple's been completely unsuccessful.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.720]   I mean, those shows are really bad.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.280]   - Yeah, well, and Amazon has had mixed success.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.680]   I mean, this is an irrational deal.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.520]   - You think it is business five seasons
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:53.360]   before seeing a pilot is just insane?
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.200]   - Yeah.
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.440]   - I'm not sure that's ever been done.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.560]   - Quarter of a billion dollars goes to the publisher
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.320]   and of course the Tolkien estate.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.160]   Amazon has to be in production within two years
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.080]   according to the deal.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.680]   So they don't have to, they have no time to waste.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.480]   Casting producers visual effects production,
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.000]   of course, north of a billion dollars.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.520]   Wow.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.680]   According to the insiders, the chief architect of the deal
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.280]   said this is the most complicated deal I've ever seen.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:27.080]   I've ever seen.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:27.920]   - Wow.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.920]   - And it just shows you, I think what it shows you.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.120]   - So it's basically like a white color employment act.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:32.960]   - Yeah.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:35.040]   No, I think it shows you how desperate these companies are
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.480]   that they really, for some reason, I'm not sure why.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.960]   Why does Amazon think this is worth it?
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.360]   They're not even in the business of making TV shows
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.440]   or are they?
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.280]   They are.
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.200]   - Oh, boss is excellent.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.040]   - Sell and subscription.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:46.880]   - Bossions, awesome.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.880]   - What the episode?
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.560]   - So, okay, so let's walk this back.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.880]   - I'm gonna go listen to this.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.760]   - So Mark, you're saying that the reason they do this
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:57.960]   is 'cause it sells Amazon Prime subscriptions.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.120]   - Yeah, gets you.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:28:59.960]   - Find that box a year.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:00.800]   - Gets you into the Amazon world.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:03.680]   I think they've also thought about decoupling video
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.640]   from Prime as well.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.760]   And they're having, they're one of the most successful
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.960]   behind Netflix.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.920]   I mean, Apple is nowhere close.
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:18.520]   - So, did they make enough money on Prime subscriptions
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.360]   to justify a billion dollar TV series?
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.440]   - Their whole model is get people into the Amazon world.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:29.040]   And if they can sell you a Prime subscription,
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.960]   that might get you to use your Prime credit card
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:35.840]   and Whole Foods and get you to buy on Amazon,
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:36.840]   buy your goods on Amazon.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.400]   - Now that's antitrust.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.240]   - They're taking their monopoly, right?
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.520]   - Trump's making an argument.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.440]   - But that's an interesting thing.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.720]   The president, now some of this seems to be the president,
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.080]   just doesn't like Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.440]   is a big part of it.
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.600]   - Wait, Bezos owns the Post privately though.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.160]   The Post is not part of Amazon.
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.600]   - There was a article in the Post.
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:57.680]   - I mean, despite the fact that if you're an Amazon Prime
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.640]   subscriber, you get a much cheaper rate
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.720]   under Washington Post subscription.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.560]   - One of the things that's completely spurious
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.640]   is Trump saying that the US Postal Service
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.040]   is going bankrupt 'cause of Amazon.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.640]   It's quite the opposite.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:11.520]   The US Postal Service is driving a truck
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.080]   to every house anyway.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:13.920]   - Right.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.600]   - The fact that Amazon spends billions
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.120]   putting packages in that truck
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.400]   is really incrementally common.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.360]   - Yeah, package revenue is the only growth area
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.520]   at the Post's office right now.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.040]   And that's being driven by Amazon.
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.240]   The Post's office has said that--
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.080]   - They make money.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.600]   - They make money from the Amazon deal.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.800]   And that e-commerce helps power the entire rest of the
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.360]   Postal Service to offer their required,
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.200]   you know, their requisite universal service.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.400]   - Take away the $5 billion Amazon gives them
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.000]   to deliver packages.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.600]   You still have to go to every house in the country
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.720]   every single day, whether there's a package in there or not.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.800]   - I've been on a mail boat that delivers mail
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.960]   up to rural towns in Oregon,
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.640]   where the roads are so bad you can't drive in.
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.040]   And so what they do every day is there's a boat
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.800]   that stops at a package and mail depot,
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.480]   loads up the boat, then the boat stops,
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:05.480]   and people come down to the boat dock and pick up their mail.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.160]   - I would submit also--
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.280]   - So it's just, the point is not everybody lives
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.520]   on an easy way to street.
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.800]   It's expensive to deliver mail in this country.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.200]   - I would submit that the US Postal Service,
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.400]   I know it's kind of trying to be run like a business,
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.720]   is a vital service of the US government.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.960]   And to say it has to make a profits kind of nuts.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.960]   - And it's not even close to making a profit.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:30.240]   - But of course, is the US army making a profit?
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.560]   It's part of what you do as a government
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.600]   is get the mail delivered.
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:38.440]   - There's arguments we made that they're not charging Amazon,
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:41.720]   the rates that a business could be charging Amazon,
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:42.880]   which is why they got that deal.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:47.400]   So I think that's, even though Trump had many flawed statements
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:48.920]   in his argument there,
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.040]   like they could potentially be charging Amazon.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.680]   - Also, Trump accused Amazon on not collecting taxes.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.560]   Of course, Amazon does collect sales taxes,
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.440]   but there is also some merit there
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:00.000]   because Amazon does not collect sales taxes
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.920]   on third party sellers on Amazon.
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.360]   That's left to the third party sellers, right?
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.320]   So there's some merit to that too.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.920]   We're being fair, we're being fair here.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:12.200]   - So I have to say, like I personally am not
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.120]   in the Lord of the Rings primarily
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.920]   because there are no women in this universe.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.640]   - Wait a minute, there's Ariel the fairy queen.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.120]   - There are a few and they added a few
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.400]   for the Peter Jackson Adaptive.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.240]   - They did, didn't they?
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.280]   - But it's primarily- - Oh, it's a bunch of guys.
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:29.600]   - It's a story about men.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.280]   - A bunch of guys with Harry, he's walking around.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.400]   - So that's it.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.240]   I personally am not that big a fan of it.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:39.880]   But I think like if you look at the really big networks
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.960]   developing the best telepis right now,
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.320]   Netflix has by far the best programming, right?
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.160]   HBO's Westworld, I would argue Showtime has Homeland
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.880]   and Billions, which are both excellent.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.000]   I'm looking forward to seeing them after all of the years.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.880]   - Billions this season is the best season yet.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.560]   - It's looking really good.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:32:59.400]   - Really good.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:02.560]   - But as far as Amazon, what did they have on that?
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.440]   I personally really like Bosch.
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.480]   I think that is an excellent show.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:11.480]   And I like that they got 24 as an exclusive show on Amazon.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:14.400]   But there's not really anything over there
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.360]   that really makes me go,
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.000]   this is something I really must have on my device.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.880]   So I think them aggressively investing
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.840]   in a tent pole property,
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.960]   it makes a lot of sense to me personally.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.800]   So I think it's exactly as you said, Mark.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.880]   I think this is getting people involved
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.560]   in their video ecosystem.
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.240]   - I'm gonna give Jeff Bezos a little business tip.
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.240]   'Cause I think you could use it, Jeff.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.800]   I'm just saying.
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.280]   Could be even more of the richest person on it.
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.880]   - It could be the twice the richest.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.440]   Coming from one of the poorest guys,
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.480]   I'll tell the richest guy.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:51.640]   What Apple did, you're right,
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.840]   Apple had made a horrible mess of it
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:57.120]   with the Planet of the Apps,
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.120]   carpool karaoke a little better, but still.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.200]   But what Apple did, what they realized is
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.800]   there is a secret to Hollywood success.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:08.560]   There are, just as there are in the gaming industry,
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.400]   just as there are in the writing trade,
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.440]   there are superstars in television production
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.520]   and movie production.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.760]   And Apple went and they found marquee people,
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.040]   people who, two executives had worked at Sony,
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.880]   who had a real track record.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.400]   And I would submit that Apple's gonna turn it around
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:26.800]   given what they've acquired.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.560]   They've really put some good deals together.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.560]   And I think that's clearly what Netflix has
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.560]   and what Amazon's lacking is the right,
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.120]   I hate to say this, the right executives.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:38.640]   - So I would actually argue that another component,
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.920]   we're talking a lot about the shows
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.200]   that they're launching now,
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.100]   but I think another reason people binge
[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:45.200]   on these streaming services
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.680]   is they get to catch up on shows
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.160]   they haven't seen the first time.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.440]   - That's where Netflix can really win.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.640]   - Or they get, well, Amazon Prime, for example,
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.640]   I never saw the series "Brotherhood on Showtime"
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.480]   when it aired.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.480]   I didn't have Showtime in the early '80s,
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.560]   but Netflix has all three, not Netflix.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.080]   Amazon Prime has all three seasons.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.160]   I've main-lined it over a weekend when I had a flu.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.840]   And I now have, well, I now have like this whole watchlist
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.040]   on Amazon to go with my whole watchlist on Netflix
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:12.160]   of series that I don't have time to watch
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.160]   during, say, a school year, but can watch during the summer.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.120]   - I feel like Netflix is better for that
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.200]   than Amazon, don't you?
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.040]   - It depends.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:22.280]   I hate thinking about having to get a Hulu subscription,
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:25.160]   but I think that's really a lot of Fox and FX ones.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.880]   But this is, for all of the buzzy news shows,
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.320]   I think what I'd love to see is a breakout
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.840]   of viewing patterns with how much,
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:37.200]   how many hours are sunk into the new content
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.520]   as it comes out in binge watching,
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.560]   say, season two of Jessica Jones,
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.560]   and how many hours are people spending
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:45.280]   rewatching the entire series' run of friends?
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.800]   - I think the numbers I've seen from Netflix are
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:52.800]   that these marquee tentpole series make money right up front.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:57.240]   That they generate new subscriptions to such a great extent.
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:58.760]   That they can even see it.
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.840]   That the day these launch, boom, the subscriptions go up,
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.360]   that they know it works.
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.400]   And I would guess Amazon is probably doing
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:07.800]   some similar calculus, although it's not as clean
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.640]   with Amazon because Amazon Prime has other reasons
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.520]   you might subscribe than Jessica Jones.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:14.880]   - What I'd also like to know is what the Amazon Prime videos
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:17.040]   is what is the breakdown of watching
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.280]   original content versus repurposed content.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:22.160]   - But see, here's the beauty of this, they know.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.760]   - And then they know exactly.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.280]   - And then the follow on question is,
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.000]   is how are they going to use that data
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]   to customize your recommendations
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.600]   or to slice and dice you into specific psychographic?
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:35.000]   - This is why the networks are out of the game.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.200]   'Cause the networks have no idea, right?
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.120]   They have people meters, they have guesses.
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:44.600]   Amazon, Netflix, Apple, they know exactly.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.080]   They know how many times you watched it,
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.480]   what time you watched it.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.200]   And Apple probably knows when you got up
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.000]   and went to the bathroom 'cause you're wearing an Apple watch.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.240]   They know everything.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.720]   And if they're smart, this is the real, this is to me,
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.560]   this is really what's happened
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.680]   to completely destroy our society, by the way.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:02.760]   This is the none of the matter,
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:06.360]   is they have all the data about your behavior.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:09.440]   And now we have the tools to write in algorithms
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.600]   and artificial intelligence machine learning
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.280]   to completely optimize form,
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.480]   and this is what went wrong with Facebook, in my opinion,
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.760]   to optimize for maximum engagement.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.120]   That just like they push the button and they say,
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.440]   "Well, we know exactly what gets people going
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:27.760]   and we can turn that up and turn it down."
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.760]   And the weaponization of attention is really,
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.240]   it's what's happened, it started first in World of Warcraft
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.240]   and gaming where they noticed which drops,
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:43.120]   which loot drops got you to play more.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.800]   It's happened now on Netflix, it's happening on Amazon.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.400]   - It's happening in every industry.
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:51.120]   - I mean, we are super hero movies are coming out this year.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.720]   - Precisely, we are helpless in the face,
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.760]   in the onslaught of big data and machine learning.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.840]   We are just tools.
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.960]   - I have a girlfriend who swore off
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.200]   almost every ad supported magazine.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.760]   Like she subscribes to the Economist
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.520]   and she swore off almost every media,
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:11.280]   except publicly supported media like PBS and NPR.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.360]   - How selfless of her.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.320]   - Well, no, every time I talk to her,
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.920]   she's like, "It is like I'm coming from other planet,"
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:17.760]   just because-
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.600]   - Because you're in a different world.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.880]   - Yeah, our experiences are substantially different
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.280]   the way that she consumes her information.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.120]   - And that's actually true.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:26.280]   People who are on Facebook have a different experience of life
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.280]   than people who weren't.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.280]   - Yeah.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.480]   And because she deliberately made a move to live in a world
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.160]   that's advertising free and mostly non streaming,
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.760]   the way that she pays attention to things
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:40.240]   and the way that she perceives a news cycle
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.080]   is incredibly different.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.800]   - Doesn't she get lonely out there in the wilderness?
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.440]   - No, she's a cat lady, she's fine.
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.280]   (laughing)
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:49.080]   - Oh, she's better cats.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.000]   That's all about it.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.560]   I said we were gonna talk about windows and we will,
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.280]   but let's take a quick break and then we will.
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:54.840]   Lisa Schmeiser is here.
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:55.840]   I like saying your name.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.680]   - Thank you.
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.680]   - She's a Schmeiser.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:58.840]   (laughing)
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.680]   - Schmeiser.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:00.520]   - Schmeiser.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.320]   - She's the editor of ITPro today.
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.120]   Mark Poormark really knows I like doing
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.320]   that with Bling, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.400]   He's a technology editor there.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.280]   I haven't yet come up with any weird way
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.760]   to pronounce Brianna Wu and Brianna Finkos.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:14.760]   - I think I'm finna be gauntlet.
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.240]   - But she does have the, that's why.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:17.080]   That's why.
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:17.920]   - That's why.
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.240]   - Don't mess with me.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.800]   - Finna be gauntlet.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:21.840]   - Oh my God.
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.640]   - Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.920]   If you're a freelancer, if you do, you know,
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.680]   send invoices out at the end of the month,
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.440]   I don't have to, I feel you're paying.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.880]   I don't have to tell you what a,
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.240]   just a bad thing it is,
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.320]   it comes to the 30th of the month and you go,
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.080]   "Oh, I got to fire up Word and Excel
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:40.560]   and make invoices and send them out."
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.320]   And the only thing worse than that is
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.400]   that if you don't do that, you don't get paid.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.640]   So you do it, but I've got a better way.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.520]   This is a way, this is something to change my life.
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.480]   Back in 2004, when I was going up to Canada
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.960]   doing the TV show, I hated to do the invoices.
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:54.400]   I had to get the expenses together
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.400]   and staple them on to print and invoice and set it up.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:39:59.880]   But if I didn't, oh, and by the way,
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:00.720]   it was a Canadian dollar,
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.480]   so I had to do the currency conversion.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.600]   Then Amber told me about FreshBooks
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.960]   and what a change that made in my life.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.480]   FreshBooks makes it easy to do invoices.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.760]   They handle currencies.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.480]   You have the FreshBooks app on your phone,
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:13.560]   you take pictures of receipts,
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.080]   it's automatically in the invoice.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.560]   If you build for time and hours,
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:20.160]   they've got a timer built into the website
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.000]   or built into the phone.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.040]   And the best part is it's not only easier and faster
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.840]   and really more professional looking to send out invoices
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.640]   with FreshBooks, you'll get paid faster
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.400]   because every, as soon as you use FreshBooks,
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.320]   you can accept credit card payments
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.880]   from the invoice directly from the invoice.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.400]   And it turns out clients want to pay you.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.920]   It's just they don't like making, playing bills anymore.
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.080]   You know, like sending bills.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.200]   So eliminate all the friction.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.960]   If you, as soon as you use Start using FreshBooks
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.360]   and you're accepting credit cards online,
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.680]   you'll get paid an average of twice as fast.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.440]   No more time waiting at the bank to cash checks.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:57.840]   Plus, you are no longer in mystery
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.200]   about how your business is doing
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:02.520]   because in the process of creating invoices,
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:05.520]   recording accounts receivable, accounts paid,
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.760]   expenses, costs, you're actually doing your books.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.840]   You don't know it, but the books are getting done
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:13.120]   and you can go to your FreshBooks dashboard and look at it
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.120]   and you know, have I made money this month?
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.600]   Yes, have I not?
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.120]   No, I never knew that.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.800]   As a freelancer, I didn't know it 'til tax time.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:22.920]   Oh, speaking of tax time, you'll be glad next year
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.640]   that you've become a FreshBooks customer
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:28.160]   because it makes all those tax reports so much easier.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.960]   It really is great.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.040]   FreshBooks is a web app, so they're always adding new features.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.600]   They just added ability to create proposals
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:39.440]   with rich text content and images and customizable sections.
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:41.000]   Not only do they handle currencies,
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.160]   they handle languages too Spanish.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.400]   They just added Spanish, Dutch, German and Portuguese.
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.240]   That's an option for invoices, estimates and proposals.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.000]   You could build for time by client,
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.720]   but you can have different rates for different projects
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.880]   even within the same client.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:55.000]   I mean, it's flexible.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000]   It's fast, it's easy.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.520]   It's a pleasure to use, and you always know
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.560]   exactly how you're doing.
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.400]   FreshBooks is always adding new features.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:07.120]   Team member rates can now be managed from the My Team page.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.960]   Speaking of team members, you can add team members,
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.840]   either as a business partner or a basic employee,
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:14.520]   a contractor, each has different permissions sets.
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.560]   From payment reminders to late fees,
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:18.840]   you can automate as much or as little as you'd like,
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.400]   and then get back to the main point of the business
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.240]   doing what you love.

[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:53.800]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.880]   So, my friend Mary Jofoli writes for ZeeDinette,
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:58.480]   called it a "demotion of windows."
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:00.360]   But Lisa Schmeiser, you said this has been going on
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.320]   for a while.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:03.000]   What happened at Microsoft this week?
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.440]   I think it was actually last week.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.360]   Tarry Meierson was last week.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.400]   I think it's been a long week.
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.000]   I know, I feel like, I know.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.800]   All right, well, we didn't talk about it last week.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.000]   So let's talk about it this week.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.720]   So, Satya Nadella, or rather,
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:20.480]   Microsoft made public the email Satya Nadella sent
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.880]   about how the company is being reorganized.
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:24.680]   They do that every year, though.
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:25.520]   Not really.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:26.440]   And--
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:27.280]   Not like this.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.120]   Not like this.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.840]   I'm gonna see where my reference point is here.
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:35.440]   And what they did, yeah, is March 30th
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.440]   that Microsoft made an announcement.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.280]   Oh, it's been that long.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:38.120]   So, yeah.
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:40.160]   And the big news that a lot of people jumped on
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.960]   was the news that Tarry Meierson,
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:44.320]   who had been EVP and Leader of the Windows
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.560]   and Devices Group, was leaving the company.
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:48.240]   He'd been at, like, 21 years.
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:49.840]   Yes, and he was, for a lot of people,
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:50.880]   he's the face of Windows.
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:52.520]   He's the person that, you know,
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.480]   if you have Windows, you have Mr. Meierson.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.880]   And a lot of people were, ah, about this.
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:01.840]   And what the bigger news is, however,
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:05.800]   is that Microsoft currently, or I should say had,
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.800]   three-- I'm pulling up my spreadsheet here now, too.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.640]   They used to have--
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:11.560]   You need a spreadsheet to keep track of those kids.
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.320]   No, I keep track of their earnings.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:15.880]   And Microsoft used to report by three different groups,
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.840]   which is Productivity and Business Processes,
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.440]   which included things like Office 365,
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.000]   Intelligent Cloud, which is where all the Azure money goes
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.320]   when they report on that,
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.520]   and more personal computing, which encompass
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:29.000]   the Windows businesses plus their OEM sales,
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.400]   their device sales, and for whatever reason,
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:32.800]   I think Bing is in there, too.
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.440]   Which is weird, because it should be.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.600]   Anyway, long story short,
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:40.960]   Microsoft used to be organized along those three lines,
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:44.080]   and it's now being reorgous,
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.600]   so there's an Experiences and Devices Group.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.560]   So it was Windows and Devices.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:49.560]   It's now Experiences and Devices.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.120]   Experiences and Devices.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.120]   And--
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.120]   Is Experiences HoloLens?
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.120]   Is it Mixed Reality?
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.120]   What is Experiences?
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.480]   Well, they're going to be--
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.480]   Good question.
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:44:59.480]   That mean.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.120]   They'll have the Surface in there with Panos Panay.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:01.640]   Right.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.760]   All the hardware is in there.
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:05.920]   Hardware is in there, Windows is in there.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:08.800]   They will have their enterprise mobility and management team
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.680]   is moving over there as well.
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:13.040]   So the sense I got is that this reorganization
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.440]   is Microsoft really saying, look, we're
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:16.280]   going to make Windows.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:18.000]   But there's no cloud in AI group.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000]   But that really our business is going to be cloud going forward.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.280]   That's where the money is going to be.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:24.920]   That's the platform.
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.960]   So when I first started covering Microsoft full time in 2015
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:31.560]   and started going to the conferences and things like that,
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.840]   the message that Nadella was hammering home
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.760]   through all of the keynotes he did
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:38.640]   was we were a mobile-first cloud-first world.
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:40.360]   And as--
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.240]   He was right, by the way.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:43.280]   This is where Steve Ballmer dropped the ball.
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:45.240]   Although Ballmer is responsible for pushing Azure.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:45.880]   So you--
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.520]   He's also responsible for buying Nokia.
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.320]   So let's--
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.600]   So you know, you win some, you lose some, right?
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.840]   Let's be honest here.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.960]   And really, Satya Nadella came from Azure,
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.280]   came from the cloud side.
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:55.840]   So he understands--
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.640]   So what's understandable is there.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:01.400]   So his first repositioning move for Microsoft in 2015
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:04.480]   was we are all about mobile-first cloud-first.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.200]   And what you'll note is there's nothing in there about Windows.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.360]   There is nothing in there about the desktop.
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:13.200]   It is about what Gail and Gruman over an info world calls
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.040]   the liquid computing experience, the idea
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.520]   that your computing experience constitutes
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.560]   a set of information that you want to manipulate.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.240]   You want to access, manipulate, and produce things
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:27.400]   with across platforms, devices, and apps.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:28.640]   It's a liquid computing experience
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:32.280]   because it moves seamlessly between devices.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:34.360]   It moves seamlessly between applications
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:36.120]   or it moves seamlessly between services.
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:39.880]   And to be frank, doesn't require Windows anymore.
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:40.760]   Exactly.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:46.560]   So what I began to notice when the next shift after that
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:48.600]   was Nadella getting up for keynotes
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.160]   and saying, we are on the edge of a great digital transformation.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:55.600]   And at the same time, they also started
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:59.960]   talking about productivity and unlocking workforce potential.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.440]   And then began pushing the idea that AI would complement
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.800]   humanity, not replace humanity.
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:07.120]   Totally different.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.920]   By the way, we do a whole other show just on that.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:11.600]   And obviously never met RoboCop.
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:14.560]   But what I noticed is that they stopped using the word
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.200]   "Windows" in any of their keynotes.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.280]   That is really weird.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:19.360]   And they began talking about collaboration.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:20.680]   They began talking about AI.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.800]   Quantum computing has come up repeatedly.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:26.080]   But Windows has not been pushed out as a Marquet project
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:28.760]   or anything that Microsoft is like,
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.520]   and we're making these tremendous strides.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.480]   It's been them emphasizing digital transformation.
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.200]   It's been them emphasizing the cloud.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:39.560]   It has been them emphasizing data intelligence.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:42.000]   It's been them emphasizing artificial intelligence.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.480]   So the groundwork for this has been going on internally
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.920]   and in market positioning for quite a while.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.320]   The reorg news that broke is pretty much just them confirming
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:57.600]   that they've basically moved their giant company
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.320]   towards the trajectory that they're on now,
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:02.640]   where they're going full in on services, AI, data manipulation,
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.280]   productivity, and collaboration.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.920]   And as Ben Thompson points out in his article,
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:09.320]   aptly titled "The End of Windows."
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.800]   It's the first time since 1980
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.920]   that the company hasn't had a division devoted
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:14.440]   to operating systems.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:16.080]   Do you need an operating system though?
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.520]   Is that-- You don't?
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.240]   I mean, we just talked about how Apple
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:20.440]   is probably producing iOS.
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:21.960]   That's why I think it's interesting.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.920]   This is, I think, related to the Apple story.
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.840]   I think this is two big companies saying,
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.360]   what does the future of computing look like?
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.920]   And how do we go to where the puck is,
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:31.280]   skate to where the puck is headed, right?
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:36.760]   Mark, what do you think?
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.120]   Is this a matter?
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.720]   Does Microsoft even matter anymore?
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:42.640]   Yeah, they matter.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:45.400]   Yeah, I mean, they're in a central component--
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:46.720]   They weren't a matter.
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:48.040]   They want a matter.
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.520]   But they aren't really--
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:52.560]   They still have a really embedded--
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.280]   They have a huge advantage in the sense
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.600]   that they're already entrenched
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.000]   in so many different ways.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.920]   But don't they feel it slipping away?
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.760]   I mean, you talked about those stats in education
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.240]   where Microsoft has gone from being dominant
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.200]   to being like this distant second.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:09.880]   Yeah, I mean, all three companies have traded places
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.200]   over the years.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.960]   If our future is Ready Player One,
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.240]   the HoloLens is a decent shot of getting us there.
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:17.080]   True.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:17.920]   It's a pretty--
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:18.760]   Yeah. It's a very good product.
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:19.600]   Oh, it's the best.
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.280]   I don't think, though, that our future is,
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.680]   to be honest with you, I don't think it's Ready Player One.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.720]   I think, Brianna, you brought up a really fundamental
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.400]   problem with virtually--
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.080]   But--
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.480]   So we can actually jack it into the back of our heads
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:34.840]   so we don't have nausea when we run in cyberspace.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:35.680]   I think we're going to see a lot of--
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.400]   A lot of solves that problem, though,
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.880]   because you can't actually see it.
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:41.080]   Yeah, but augmented reality isn't the oasis.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:43.360]   Augmented reality is more of--
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:44.840]   Augmented reality.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:47.280]   Yeah, it's augmenting what you're seeing
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:49.320]   with additional information from the computer.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.440]   I think augmented reality actually does a lot
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:53.400]   to eliminate a lot of service jobs
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.560]   and geographically dependent jobs, to be honest.
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:56.960]   I agree with that.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:02.120]   Well, one of the most sobering demos I saw was CES 2017.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:04.640]   I went to the Intel press event.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.280]   And they had us put on a little AR headsets.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:09.440]   And first we got to take a tour through Ricepatties
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:11.760]   in Vietnam because it's virtual tourism, right?
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:15.000]   But then they showed us a real-time streaming demonstration
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:21.560]   of a drone flying over a solar power bank in eastern Nevada.
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.360]   And it occurred to me right then and right there
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:30.400]   that if you had the drones available and you had headsets,
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.480]   you could basically eliminate security guards
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.160]   because you could pay remote workers to be online doing shift work.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.160]   They might even be at home.
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:37.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:38.480]   The same--
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:38.880]   The same one.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:41.080]   The same way that the customer service industry
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:41.800]   decentralized--
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.720]   That has happened, hasn't it?
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:44.760]   --and people operate call centers out of their house.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.880]   Or they patch into call centers.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:46.880]   They're part of a call center.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.120]   But they don't leave home.
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:49.760]   Because they can do the work remotely at night or whatever.
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:54.760]   There's no reason why with drones anything that requires
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:57.320]   people just to notice something and then act on what they notice.
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:00.080]   That's something that you could do with augmented reality.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.120]   That's security guards.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:04.760]   That's a reliable position that makes OK money in some places
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:06.040]   that provides steady employment.
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:08.160]   That can be outsourced to somebody who will do it
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.880]   for much cheaper someplace else.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.440]   And augmented reality is going to do that
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:13.680]   with a couple more classes of jobs.
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:16.160]   So I have to say, I think Microsoft
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:20.040]   is one of the most interesting companies operating today.
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:22.680]   And I'm a Mac fan girl.
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:24.520]   I generally buy Apple things.
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:28.080]   But Leah, our mutual friend, Christina Warren,
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.440]   she moved over to Microsoft recently.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.760]   And she has an excellent YouTube channel
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:37.360]   that's highlighting all the various things that they do.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:42.440]   And the range of technologies that Microsoft is working on
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:47.480]   since I started watching that, it really blows my mind.
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:50.880]   Microsoft is a company that has being as a division that
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.960]   makes-- I don't know how many hundreds of millions
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:57.760]   of dollars in for any other company would be a major deal.
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:59.120]   We don't even talk about it.
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:01.640]   As if it doesn't even exist.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:04.920]   So when we're talking about a feature without Windows,
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:08.280]   I think this statement, like, we don't
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.120]   need operating systems anymore.
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:13.560]   That's a little too broad for me because I do think APIs
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.480]   and development methodology is always
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:18.680]   going to require a concrete vision for how
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:20.240]   that's coming forward.
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:24.040]   But I do feel like Microsoft, because they
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:27.160]   miss the mobile revolution, I feel
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:30.920]   like they're constantly being underrated.
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:32.160]   They're an underdog.
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:35.240]   And I think, generally speaking in tech,
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:40.200]   we have a very dated view about what Microsoft is,
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.680]   what they're doing, and how relevant they are
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:44.080]   to the future of computing.
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.880]   All you have to do is look at their stock price.
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:47.680]   The stock market agrees with you 100%.
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:49.640]   Well, I think one of the things you bring up, too,
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:53.840]   is one of my favorite RSS feeds is the Microsoft Research
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:55.440]   feed, because you get to find out what they're working
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:56.480]   in the labs.
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:02.280]   And one of the things that I have noticed over the past few years
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:06.200]   is they're doing a lot of work in remote medicine
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.640]   and telemedicine, especially in areas where you don't have
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:10.320]   a lot of infrastructure.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:14.880]   And IBM, similarly, has begun to turn their attention to that.
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:17.840]   And I think, in addition to their sea changes,
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:20.920]   what we're also looking at is a tech market where
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:23.200]   American consumers and American business
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:26.960]   companies are no longer the primary drivers for these companies.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.440]   They're thinking on a genuinely global scale,
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:32.120]   where they're looking at new market opportunities
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.080]   in different parts of the world.
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.840]   Yeah, because they have a chance--
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:38.800]   Well, they have a chance to define what the market--
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.440]   what the technology experience is, what the demand is,
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:44.000]   how they'll meet it, and be the first--
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:44.800]   It's tough, though.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.640]   China is tough.
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:49.280]   I mean, Windows in China is tough.
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:52.480]   Well, what I'm saying is we tend to look at, say,
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:56.040]   Europe, Asia, and the US as your primary drivers.
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:58.000]   But the world is bigger than that.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:58.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.160]   And we're not even taking--
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:02.600]   there are markets across the Middle East.
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:03.600]   There are other parts of Asia.
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.560]   There's Eastern Africa.
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:07.280]   There are markets in South America.
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:07.780]   Yeah.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:08.880]   These guys are all going to look at that.
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.560]   Ben Thompson's article, really good.
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.240]   Highly, as always, has been very smart.
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:13.920]   He ends it, though, with--
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:17.560]   Nadella's next challenge is to understand that Windows is not
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:20.160]   and will not drive future growth is one thing.
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:24.200]   Identifying future drivers of that growth is another.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:27.360]   And that's always been a historic challenge of Microsoft.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.400]   You mentioned Microsoft Research, which
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:33.720]   has, for decades, done some of the most forward-looking--
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.200]   I mean, since Bell Labs--
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:36.560]   And none of us made it to the market.
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.280]   Yeah, they haven't commercialized any of it.
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:39.300]   We did it--
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:41.160]   It was very much like Xerox Park, where
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.400]   they invented the future.
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.400]   But nobody--
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:44.800]   I think they'd monetize it.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.680]   We did a piece several years ago resurfacing this old video
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:51.720]   they showed, I think, '99 of everything Microsoft Research
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:52.480]   was working on.
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.840]   And it was today.
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:56.360]   It was like cell phones and video chat.
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:57.400]   They nailed it.
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:58.480]   They were so spot on.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:00.160]   They just didn't make any of it.
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:00.760]   Wow.
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:02.160]   Well, maybe they just chose--
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.360]   It's not so hard--
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:08.920]   It's actually not so hard to think of new things.
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:12.560]   It's a lot harder to make it happen to change the market.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:14.920]   To Ben's point, to pick your battles.
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:15.840]   To pick your battles.
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.080]   To figure out what's important.
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.720]   I'd say look at HoloLens.
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:24.400]   Like, this is a product that is so good if Microsoft
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:28.160]   had put more time into it and had found a way
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:30.720]   to bring consumer version forward.
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:31.160]   I really--
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:32.200]   Well, let's be fair, though.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.000]   It's not over yet for HoloLens.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.240]   It's not over.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:38.120]   But I can tell you being on the ground.
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:41.600]   Like, being in developer circles, talking people,
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.560]   they're going to GDC.
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:47.080]   It's like, technically, Amazon's lumber yards.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:50.680]   It is still around, but it's not something developers
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:53.560]   are actively thinking about.
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:55.960]   I feel like what I'm worried about is Microsoft
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:59.600]   test is really fantastic product that's out there.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:03.200]   But I'm seeing them lose the momentum.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:06.000]   And I think like Magic Leap might come forward
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.640]   and kind of take that over to your point mark.
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:12.240]   So I want to see them be very aggressive
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:15.000]   about putting more products out there.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.800]   Like, Leah, the Surface tablet you have in front of you.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.920]   That's one of the best things they put out in years.
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.040]   I want to see that Microsoft more.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:28.360]   Well, in the REORG, Panos Panay stays with the Surface Group,
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:29.880]   and they're going to continue, I think,
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.280]   to do really interesting hardware.
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:33.960]   I have to say, I'm the only one of the four of you
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:35.560]   using a Windows machine at the moment.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:35.640]   But--
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:41.280]   And frankly, in many ways, as a disappointing computer,
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.040]   this is the Surface Studio.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:47.360]   It's expensive, mostly because it has a 30-inch super high-res
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:48.440]   touchscreen.
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:51.480]   The actual guts of the computer are fairly anemic.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.360]   And we actually upgraded.
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:54.640]   It had a very slow hard drive.
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:55.560]   It put in an SSD.
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:58.320]   And it's not kind of the fastest processor.
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.600]   But where it really sings is something, in fact,
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:01.800]   that feels very much like Apple.
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.800]   Something Apple should have done, which
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:06.200]   is with a giant 30-inch touchscreen that's just gorgeous.
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:07.700]   Yeah.
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:09.360]   And if you're an illustrator and artist,
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:12.280]   the idea that it could sit at this drafting table angle
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:15.760]   and you can use a pen and draw, I wonder, though--
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:18.160]   I don't think Microsoft's selling very many of these.
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:20.200]   I don't think this is a big success.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:21.760]   I'm not sure they ever thought they would.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:22.600]   They didn't care.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.840]   It's expensive by design.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:26.680]   It's probably targeted at companies.
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:28.400]   Idiots like me.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:31.120]   Oh, that's perfect for what I do with it, though.
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:32.400]   I don't take it home.
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:33.560]   It sits here on this table.
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.400]   You use it for your job, though, right?
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.040]   Well, I use it in a way.
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:40.920]   I mean, if your job is hosting a technology news round table--
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.920]   Way.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:42.920]   Yes, there you go.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.560]   It's perfect.
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:47.680]   I feel like the only reason I stay with the Apple ecosystem
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:48.600]   is privacy.
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:49.680]   That's it.
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:52.720]   Well, but that's a huge story for them now.
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:54.240]   Well, that's it.
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.320]   And for me, I have to think about messages being intercepted.
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:00.680]   And, you know, Leah, we were doing a show a while back.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:03.040]   So I was talking about being a security conference
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:05.480]   and how every Android phone there was
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:08.360]   pwned within the first 10 minutes.
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:10.880]   And that's literally the only thing
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:12.400]   that's keeping me on Apple.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.200]   It's not that Microsoft hardware that I see coming out
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:18.160]   is any worse or their mail client is worse.
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:20.000]   It's not lock in with iTunes.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.440]   It's privacy.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:22.760]   That's it.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.040]   I think that was probably one of the greatest marketing
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:27.480]   gambit that Apple's come out with in years.
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:28.480]   You think it's marketing?
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:29.880]   It's a shift to privacy.
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:30.960]   Oh, my God.
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:31.480]   Yes.
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:33.080]   They created social networks.
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:33.920]   They were bad.
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:34.560]   Nobody used that.
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:35.080]   That's right.
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:37.360]   So they made a virtue out of ping.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.400]   And the failure of ping.
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:42.320]   And they invested in cloud artificial intelligence
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:42.920]   with Siri.
[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:43.920]   It's bad.
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:45.360]   So terrible.
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:45.880]   The show.
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:48.360]   Well, I was a Bloomberg Gavfly that was--
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:51.280]   I want to say last Friday, where the writer pointed out
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:53.960]   that the reason Apple can actually talk about privacy
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:55.920]   right now is because they don't--
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.400]   Because they flocked.
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:58.920]   Well, no, they don't need to sell the data as a revenue
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.680]   source right now.
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:01.120]   They're a hardware company.
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:02.120]   They're a hardware company.
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:04.400]   They have all the companies you must talk about.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.680]   They're the only ones that really are primarily
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.320]   a hardware company, not Microsoft.
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:11.120]   Not Amazon, not Google, not Facebook, not Twitter.
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:13.200]   Although they're seeing a lot of growth in services,
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.400]   mainly from App Store sales.
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.240]   I was a bit--
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.920]   From ecosystem lock-in.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:19.960]   But the point--
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:22.800]   But that's how you take advantage of ecosystem lock-in
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:24.600]   is services.
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:27.720]   Apple Music, App Store.
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:29.840]   Apple did make a big hire this week.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:30.720]   They made two.
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:31.560]   Two.
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:33.360]   All right, well, I'm going to tell you the one I know about.
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:35.040]   They hired Google's chief of search
[01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:37.880]   and artificial intelligence, John Ginnadrea.
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:41.640]   Now, this is interesting because Ginnadrea left Google.
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:44.560]   And like, within 24 hours, they announced that Apple had
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:45.000]   hired him.
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.920]   I'm not sure what the exact timing of all of this is.
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:51.200]   But big score for Apple.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:55.160]   And I think Apple's saying, no, yeah, maybe series of flop.
[01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:57.680]   But we're not giving up on AI.
[01:59:57.680 --> 01:59:59.640]   What was the other big hire?
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:01.160]   Bloomberg.
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:02.160]   According to Bloomberg--
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:03.960]   I'm showing Bloomberg more effectively than you are.
[02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:05.760]   I'm learning of Bloomberg.
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:09.480]   Bloomberg reported today that Apple hired John McCormack, who
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:12.120]   used to be an executive in Google's Advanced Technology
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:13.360]   and Products Group.
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:16.640]   And he was the CTO for Amazon for a while.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:18.840]   Oh, that's a very interesting hire.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:21.480]   Do they have any idea where McCormack's going?
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:23.600]   He said Vice President were he on software.
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:26.320]   That's all they're saying.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:26.800]   You know what?
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:28.920]   I think competition is the best thing.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:31.080]   And I love seeing these companies
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:35.920]   poach from each other, try to beat each other in the marketplace.
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:37.680]   Apple has a great story with privacy.
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.560]   I think you're right.
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:40.120]   I think they fell into it by default, Mark.
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.680]   I think that's exactly right.
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:44.560]   But it is a good story now, more than ever.
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:49.320]   If it's real, some of it is maybe more waving the flag
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:51.320]   than actually doing it.
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:53.320]   Another failure, I adds.
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.720]   Apple would love to have sold our information to advertisers.
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:59.200]   But their system failed.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.560]   So they couldn't.
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:03.720]   So I don't know how much they really believe in all of this.
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:06.040]   Well, in recent years, their products
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.520]   have followed the marketing.
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:11.520]   They are doing more device-centric processing.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.920]   And I would prefer to have an iPhone, as you said, Brianna,
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:18.200]   that I would prefer to have an iPhone in terms of privacy
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:18.720]   than an Android.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:20.400]   You've got secure enclave.
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:23.080]   You've got iMessage, which has public, private key
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:23.920]   encryptions.
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:26.880]   And no one can intercept the messages in between it.
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.360]   I think you can look at the iCloud email service.
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:31.880]   It got hacked that one time.
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:36.640]   But I think there were series about patching it.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:41.400]   They've taken very bold steps against government attacks,
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:46.360]   trying to get data in a way that I don't support.
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:51.080]   So I don't want to sound like an Apple fan girl.
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:53.600]   But I think their commitment to privacy
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.880]   has been very genuine, in my opinion.
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:58.240]   In fact, Tim Cook took some shots at Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.200]   Mark Zuckerberg took some shots back.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.880]   I mean, this has been a fun thing to watch.
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:07.000]   This is a good measure of how important to consumers' privacy
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.240]   is versus a working, for instance, voice assistant.
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.040]   Siri still is not much brighter.
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:13.920]   I may be John Israel.
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:14.480]   It will help.
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:15.000]   Yeah.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.480]   Siri.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:17.640]   [GASP]
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:19.880]   I love seeing these companies play this chess game
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:20.720]   and try to win.
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:21.520]   I really do.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:22.400]   You want to see this.
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:25.720]   It's good for us.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:27.160]   Let's take a little break.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:29.600]   We'll have some final thoughts in just a little bit.
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:34.200]   Can you find for me that Bloomberg video of Microsoft
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:35.800]   in the '90s?
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.400]   I would love to see what they thought
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:40.000]   the world would be like today.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.400]   I also want to read out this message in the chat room.
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.000]   Stoneway.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.480]   It says Bloomberg on Apple TV is lit.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:49.000]   Bloomberg on Apple TV is--
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:49.800]   Interesting.
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:51.200]   It's on fleek.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.200]   It's woke.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:53.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:55.200]   Well, that's fine.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.600]   Let's not go that far.
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:57.800]   You know it's woke.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:58.800]   You know what's great?
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:03.200]   People going down my backyard when my ring--
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:06.000]   Oh, I love this spotlight cam.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.200]   The floodlight cam is on and the lights come on
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:11.800]   and the camera sends me a notification.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.400]   Somebody's in your backyard and I say,
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:14.800]   "Hey, what are you doing there?"
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:16.000]   And they say, "Huh?"
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.200]   And then I press the button and the 110 decibel alarm goes off.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:23.000]   And then I have crystal clear HD video of them
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.200]   running the hell out of there.
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:27.400]   That's what's on fleek, baby.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.600]   The ring video doorbell started it all, remember?
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:34.920]   I installed my ring video doorbell a couple of years ago
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:36.600]   and I just-- I still love it.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:39.680]   It's just-- I always know what's going on in my house.
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:43.360]   Then Ring added the security camera, the stick up cam,
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:45.680]   which is basically Ring video doorbell camera
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:49.200]   that's solar powered to give you more awareness
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:51.120]   about what's going around your house and around your house.
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:53.840]   Now they've got the floodlight cam, a motion activated camera
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:56.280]   and floodlight that connects to your phone.
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:59.280]   Now you really-- you know what's going on
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:02.920]   and you can protect your home even if you're not home
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:05.400]   because all of these devices connect to the internet
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:08.880]   and give you a chance to know what's going on,
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:10.800]   to speak to somebody at your door,
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.160]   if they're leaving a package to say,
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:15.440]   "Hey, put it over there.
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:16.840]   I just love it."
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:20.560]   And what I also love is going to the Ring Twitter feed.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:23.280]   This is twitter.com/ring.
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:25.120]   I got a-- here's a good one.
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:26.840]   "Tired of the constant vandalism and theft
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:27.880]   in his neighborhood, Connor,
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.760]   enlisted the help of Ring to stop crimes
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:32.600]   before they happen with instant alerts and two-way talk,
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:37.160]   it was easy to stop this suspicious lurker in his tracks."
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:38.440]   This is the most recent.
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:39.520]   What's this guy doing?
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:41.720]   He's looking. He's in my backyard.
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:42.720]   He's looking at my--
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:44.160]   Get away from my truck.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.200]   Whoa.
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:47.680]   Get out of here.
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:48.800]   Yes, sir, he says.
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:51.760]   Now he's slinking away.
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:52.840]   God, I would have run.
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:53.480]   I don't know.
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:57.040]   If a voice comes out of nowhere, get away from my truck.
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:58.840]   Anyway, the guy left.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:02.240]   Ring.com/twit.
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:03.920]   Thieves just can't hide with Ring.
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.360]   Monitor every corner of your property
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.760]   with a Ring of Security kit.
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:07.920]   Now, this is a good deal.
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:09.200]   It includes the Ring video doorbell.
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:12.040]   Your choice of either one, two, or three floodlight cams.
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:12.920]   You know what we did?
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:15.800]   We had the outdoor lights on our house,
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:17.440]   but they didn't have the cameras or anything.
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:19.960]   And I was very easy to remove the outdoor light.
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:21.880]   And these are very-- they're wired.
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:22.800]   So you just put them right in.
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:23.800]   It was very easy.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:25.320]   I didn't even need an electrician to do it
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:26.520]   to replace it with this.
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.280]   And now it's motion sensitive.
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:29.480]   It lights up.
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:32.960]   We get a lot of wildlife out there in the back 40.
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:36.200]   And it's really great to know that that's there.
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:38.480]   Lisa uses this to monitor our cats.
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:40.040]   You're a cat lover.
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:41.320]   You're a cat lover.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:45.680]   Monitor your cats with your Ring video doorbell
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:46.960]   and spotlight cam.
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:49.400]   She will check to see--
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.120]   because we get notifications that there's a kitty cat.
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:54.560]   Or actually does it say a kitty cat, but there's motion.
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:57.640]   And she'll look and say, oh, there's Sammy.
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:58.760]   Oh, there's Paris.
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:05:59.280]   That's good.
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:01.400]   She's coming home.
[02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:02.400]   More than monitoring cats.
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:04.840]   Stop crying before it happens and make your neighborhood safer
[02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:06.320]   with Ring.
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:09.160]   So, Leah, I want to tell you something we've dealt with
[02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:12.800]   is we obviously have people that don't like us with me
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:13.960]   running for Congress.
[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:15.600]   And we deal with things like people
[02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:18.920]   outside our home taking photographs of Frank and I
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:19.760]   through the window.
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:20.600]   Oh, my God.
[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:22.760]   And someone actually came to our house the other day
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:25.360]   because it's in all these public documents now.
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:28.920]   And just put a huge dent in my husband's brand new dot.
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:29.960]   Darn it.
[02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:32.440]   But this is awesome.
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:34.200]   Can we-- can I read it?
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:37.000]   Let me contribute to your campaign by--
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.160]   I don't know if this-- how this will go under the FEC rules.
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:41.160]   But I want to send you--
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:42.520]   It will be an in-kind donation.
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:43.400]   It will be legal.
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:43.840]   Yes.
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:45.800]   Legal, but I have to register.
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:48.560]   I want to send you-- let me send you the Ring of Security kit.
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:49.200]   How many do you need?
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:50.160]   One, two, or three.
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:51.040]   You need this.
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.520]   So the doorbell watches your front.
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:56.040]   You might want to watch each side of the house in the back
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:56.400]   of the house.
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.720]   That would be the doorbell plus three.
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:58.840]   You want to do that?
[02:06:58.840 --> 02:06:59.600]   Yeah, please do.
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:00.320]   It's on its way.
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.680]   Stop crying before it happens.
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:04.280]   Make your neighborhood a safer place with Ring.
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:10.080]   Save up to $150 on the Ring of Security kit at Ring.com/twit.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:14.800]   Ring-R-I-N-G.com/twit.
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:15.800]   Yo, you need this, Breanne.
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:17.320]   I'm going to send this out to you right now.
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:17.760]   Thank you.
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:19.320]   I appreciate that.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.920]   Lisa, not you, Lisa.
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:24.800]   Other Lisa, Transitive Property of Lisa's.
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:26.320]   We're going to send Breanne-- you need it.
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:28.560]   Ring.com/twit.
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:32.720]   And you'll save up to $150 on a Ring of Security kit.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:36.960]   Speaking of break-ins, Panera Bread, Lord and Taylor
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:39.360]   and Sax Fifth Avenue, which is kind of neat.
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:42.760]   I thought they were gone, but apparently they still exist.
[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:45.920]   Now the FBI is shutting down backpage.com.
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:47.960]   I don't know how I'm going to meet hookers.
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:48.920]   Life is really--
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:49.680]   No, I'm kidding.
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:51.000]   Kidding.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.400]   On to the next story about Grinder listed here.
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:55.880]   Yeah, well, this makes me mad.
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:56.760]   Not me personally.
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:03.560]   So Grinder, which is Tinder for gay men, right?
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:04.320]   Am I right?
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:06.080]   I don't know why I'm looking at you, Mark.
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:09.320]   Grinder's Tinder for gay men.
[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:11.520]   Now this is a weird story because when you set up
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:13.080]   your profile on Grinder, there's a field
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:14.520]   you could put in your HIV status.
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:17.840]   Of course, that's part of dating as a gay man.
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:21.880]   And the last time you got tested.
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:25.760]   But so I think if you put this in Grinder
[02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:28.560]   that you have the reasonable expectation that Grinder--
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:31.080]   this is sensitive material--
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:32.960]   is going to at least keep it to itself.
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.440]   I understand it's on your profile,
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:36.400]   so anybody goes to visit your profile and see it.
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:38.160]   You've published it, in effect.
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:41.080]   But the presumption is it's going to be other gay guys looking
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:41.680]   for dates.
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:44.720]   And so I don't mind sharing it with them.
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:47.440]   Grinder, meanwhile, in order to improve the performance
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:50.200]   of his app shares this data with third party app
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:52.440]   performance companies.
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:55.840]   Now Grinder says, well, you made it public, which I kind of
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:57.800]   understand, you did.
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:01.920]   So this is a problem of a perception problem, where
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:03.880]   really, I mean, obviously, if you think about it,
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:07.000]   you put it on your Grinder page, you made it public.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.600]   So anybody can see it.
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:11.600]   But the same time, I understand internally, you might feel
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:13.040]   like, well, yeah, but I didn't expect
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:16.720]   them to give this to some third party.
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:23.360]   And anyway, back to Backpage, because I'm a straight man.
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:25.360]   And I want to meet--
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:26.360]   I'm sorry.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:28.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:30.720]   This is actually surprisingly controversial.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:34.240]   Backpage, which I gather, based on its name, was replacing
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:37.840]   the Back pages of those weekly newspapers
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:40.400]   you find around town.
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:42.440]   And was primarily-- I don't know, primarily,
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:48.440]   were often used by sex workers to solicit.
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.640]   Been shut down by the FBI.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:52.480]   Sex workers are upset, because it's great.
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:54.640]   You send us right back out to the street.
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:57.720]   Is that really the consequence you want of this?
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:59.200]   But it's illegal still.
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:02.200]   So this is another one, where I don't think the--
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:03.040]   it's obvious.
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:07.000]   Apparently, the Justice Department worked with attorneys
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.840]   general in California in Texas to shut down the website.
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:14.400]   A court in Arizona has sealed the case,
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:19.280]   so we don't know all the details of the seizure and so forth.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:22.880]   You know, my campaign doesn't like it when I talk about this.
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:23.880]   I bet.
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:25.520]   But to be-- I have to be honest with you,
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:28.160]   I am a sex positive feminist.
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:30.160]   I don't think you can have women's liberation
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:32.080]   without having sexual liberation.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.200]   And I think we need to find a way
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:39.760]   to make sex work safe and legal for the people that
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:41.000]   participate in this.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.880]   This is part of human nature.
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:46.040]   It's always going to exist and pretending it's not
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:47.600]   something that's going to happen.
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:53.360]   It's just going to make the women and men that do it unsafe.
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:54.000]   I do want to say--
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.600]   I'm not a shaver, and I know you're not exactly.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:57.160]   You're about to say this.
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:10:59.040]   This is not sex trafficking of children,
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:01.040]   and that's horrible and a sense of--
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:01.880]   That's what I would say.
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:03.920]   That is a really big problem, though.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:09.720]   And there is a really big problem with trafficking.
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.480]   Children and also women from other countries
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:15.640]   into the United States is a bigger problem than people
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:16.400]   understand.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:18.600]   I've talked to experts on my campaign on that.
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:21.960]   And it is something that we need to aggressively look at.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:27.080]   But I have to say, I don't think making sex workers unsafe
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:28.440]   is good policy.
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:29.760]   I just don't.
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:31.480]   I think we've got to find a middle ground.
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:35.240]   And there is some evidence that Backpage was used
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:39.400]   to facilitate sex trafficking with minors as well as adults.
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:44.120]   And of course, for that, and if they knowingly supported
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:47.080]   that and facilitated that, bye-bye.
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:50.240]   But I do think there should be we should find a way
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:53.080]   to support sex workers.
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:54.520]   Not necessarily--
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.600]   I need to be protected.
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:57.520]   I agree.
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:11:58.800]   I'm not running for Congress, though.
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:00.120]   You're crazy to talk about.
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:02.440]   No, I really think--
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.960]   Leo, something I've found is marijuana policy
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:07.000]   is a really good thing.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.920]   I think 10 years ago, a politician coming out and saying,
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:12.000]   you know, I'm very much in favor of federally
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.800]   legalizing marijuana.
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:15.520]   I think it would have seemed ridiculous.
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:19.240]   It is a mainstream opinion now that gets a huge cheer.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:20.320]   And I just--
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:24.920]   I think that the internet has opened all of us up
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:31.600]   to a more honest version of how all of us live our lives.
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:32.520]   I have sex workers.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:33.600]   I follow on Twitter.
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:35.120]   They seem like nice people.
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:39.120]   And I want them to be safe just like I want anyone to be safe.
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:40.640]   That's just how I feel.
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:43.720]   On the links between Backpage and sex trafficking,
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:47.280]   at January 2017, Senate report accuses from wired.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:50.080]   It keys Backpage of facilitating online sex trafficking
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:53.760]   by stripping words like Lolita, Little Girl, and Amber Alert
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.960]   from ads in order to hide illegal activity
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:57.800]   before publishing the ad.
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:00.960]   Yeah, but if it's not in the ad, they're saying--
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:03.120]   They're saying that the users would file--
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:04.920]   The users would know it was in the ad--
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:07.160]   Would write in their ads these words
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:08.480]   and the website would strip it out.
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.800]   Well, they should refuse the ads, not strip it out.
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:11.800]   I think that's-- OK.
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:12.560]   That's the error.
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:15.280]   All right, so maybe there's more to this story than we see it.
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:17.480]   Here's the story that there's probably more to this story
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:18.120]   than meets the eye.
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:21.240]   Intel-- you know, they make those nooks, those little computers.
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:24.120]   And people attach them to the back of a TV,
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:25.640]   but they don't have a keyboard in their mouse.
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:27.760]   So Intel made a really nice little program.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:29.480]   Android and iOS called Remote Keyboard.
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:32.880]   Let you use your phone to type on these.
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.720]   So it was really nice for people using nooks
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:37.240]   for media centers and stuff like that.
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:38.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.040]   On Tuesday, Intel discovered some critical flaws--
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:44.960]   bugs that allowed privilege escalation
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.120]   and people to intercept typing.
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.680]   And instead of fixing it, they just said, ah, screw it.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:54.400]   Pull down the app.
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:55.840]   That's a new way to fix problems.
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:57.120]   Ah, screw it.
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:00.120]   I just-- oh, don't use that.
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:01.320]   It's not worth that.
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:03.000]   Not worth that.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.680]   I could fix it, but why?
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:06.640]   Intel said, no, we're going to pull it down anyway,
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:10.600]   but it is kind of an interesting coincidence.
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:13.520]   I hope this is not the new way to fix flaws.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:17.120]   Ow, just delete the program for crying out loud.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:18.520]   You don't really need that.
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:21.000]   Isn't that kind of the moral equivalent of,
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.920]   have you turned it off and turned it back on?
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:23.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:24.720]   We're just going to delete it.
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:26.520]   Let's do it.
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.080]   And Adjut Pai's Harlem Shake video,
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:32.480]   which was on the face of it incredibly offensive
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:34.240]   when he killed net neutrality, but showed you
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:37.360]   all the wonderful things you could do with the internet
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:39.080]   in a Harlem Shake video, which also
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:42.160]   showed that he really was behind the times.
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:48.800]   The SEC says, now, the video preparations must remain secret.
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:50.720]   What?
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:53.280]   So the video was shot with Daily Caller,
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.960]   which is a conservative news site just before the vote
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:58.760]   to repeal net neutrality.
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:00.960]   Reportedly, one of the dancing partners
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:04.280]   was a proponent of the bogus, completely bogus,
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:06.520]   pizza gate theory.
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:13.960]   So, Muckrock, executive editor J. Pat Brown, filed a FOIA
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:16.880]   request saying, you know, I'd like to see the emails
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:19.560]   between the Daily Caller and the FCC, as well as any talking
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:23.520]   points regarding this quote, huge PR coup.
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:27.560]   Four months later, the FCC responds, we have the emails,
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:31.800]   but we're going to take advantage of the B5 exemption
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:34.440]   regarding deliberative process and no.
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:37.400]   And this is the second time the agency under Adjut Pai
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:42.480]   has used the same exemption, which is a deliberative process
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:44.760]   privilege on a stupid YouTube video.
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:48.680]   There was the Verizon, the video they did with Verizon.
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:50.400]   So they do this a lot, I guess.
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:51.360]   Well, at least twice.
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:54.200]   It's a total abuse of the law.
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:56.200]   The idea of the law, the B5 provision
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:59.600]   is to protect free and frank debate about policy options,
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:03.800]   not to avoid embarrassment to the chairman of the FCC.
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:05.440]   You know, if you have to use government policy
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:07.720]   to hide your embarrassing YouTube videos, maybe don't make
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:08.400]   them.
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:09.200]   Yeah.
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:09.600]   Yeah.
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:11.000]   Maybe just stop making the embarrassing--
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.640]   No one is making you make those videos.
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:15.320]   Pull an Intel say, you know, forget it.
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:16.800]   I'm sorry I did that.
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:21.760]   Can I say how heartbreaking it is to see just how instantly
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:25.520]   it went from us having this vote to destroy something
[02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:28.680]   that's so important to a democracy to--
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:33.160]   yeah, you drive past T-Mobile or any other wireless store
[02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:37.320]   nowadays, and they're already advertising their policies
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:41.080]   about getting free videos because of destroyed net neutrality.
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.520]   And it just--
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:48.800]   it churns my stomach to see just how quickly we are throwing
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:52.680]   something so critical to a free society away.
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:55.320]   It just-- it makes me sad.
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:57.120]   You know, last night I thought it'd be fun.
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:00.360]   I wanted to watch something light uplifting.
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:02.920]   Reddit read a Mike Judge's idiosyncrasies.
[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:04.800]   No.
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:05.640]   I started watching--
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:06.440]   It's a documentary.
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:06.720]   Yeah.
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:09.840]   I'd seen it many times and thought it was very funny.
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:11.920]   It's not funny anymore.
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:17.400]   We had a neighbor who in 2016, their campaign sign,
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:19.720]   their front yard was for Camacho.
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:20.600]   Oh, really?
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:23.800]   Well, it was until about the day after the election.
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:26.320]   And I put that one down.
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:26.800]   Yeah, it was--
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:27.800]   It's a documentary.
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:29.600]   Yeah, no, and I think I'll finally hit many--
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:32.080]   The premise of it is that this--
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:34.040]   and it takes place at like 100 years from now.
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:36.400]   The society's guys got dumber and dumber and dumber
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:41.040]   and dumber to the point where you can't get a doctor because nobody
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:43.440]   knows anything anymore.
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:46.240]   And it was just depressing.
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:47.640]   It was like, oh.
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:51.840]   The president is a world wrestling federation--
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:53.840]   A reality TV star that could happen.
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:54.840]   Ooh.
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:55.840]   And--
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:59.160]   We also have a reality TV star in Congress, too,
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:00.200]   because you're forgetting there's
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:03.400]   a member of the House of Representatives
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:05.160]   who was on the real world Boston.
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:05.480]   Really?
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:06.440]   I didn't know that.
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:07.120]   What?
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:07.600]   Yeah.
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:08.120]   Who is it?
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:09.880]   Oh, Hannah was it, though.
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:11.560]   I'm trying to remember what Sean's last name is now.
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:12.520]   That's funny.
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:13.960]   Googling for the real world Boston.
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:14.800]   Because I remember watching--
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:17.360]   Was Jesse Ventura wasn't the worst governor we've ever had?
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:18.360]   No, but--
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:18.880]   Yeah.
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:20.360]   Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:21.440]   Hold on.
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:23.600]   I just hope the rock isn't serious.
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:25.640]   Yeah, it was Sean Campus.
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:26.160]   Oh, my god.
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:28.000]   Oh, excuse me, Sean Duffy, who's now a congressman
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.200]   from Wisconsin.
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.200]   Well, wasn't the guy--
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:31.200]   Right.
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:33.200]   Yeah.
[02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:34.640]   Long-standing congressman.
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:36.160]   It wasn't he like--
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:39.200]   The gopher from the love boat was a member of Congress.
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:39.680]   Yeah.
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:40.680]   Right?
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:41.320]   Yeah.
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:41.840]   Yeah.
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:43.440]   You know, at the height of Gamergate,
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:47.320]   I had three different offers to come in and be on reality
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:48.120]   TV show.
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:48.840]   Of course it is.
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:49.960]   They thought.
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:53.120]   And I'm like, nope, this could be bad for my career.
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:54.960]   I'm so glad I said no now.
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:56.240]   So just a word of warning.
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:18:57.920]   If you're thinking tonight it'd be a great night
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:18:59.200]   to watch it, Eocracy.
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:01.040]   It's too depressing.
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:02.200]   Let's-- too soon.
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:03.680]   Too soon.
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:05.280]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:11.400]   Brianna Wu, 2018.com, if you'd like to support this brave
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:14.200]   and strong woman for her--
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:15.200]   Thank you.
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:17.480]   --run to win the Massachusetts 8th
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:20.360]   and bring some common sense into the House of Representatives.
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:22.680]   We are so all for you.
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:25.800]   And that in-kind donation is on its way.
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:26.480]   Thank you, Leah.
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:27.360]   I appreciate that.
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:27.840]   I--
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:29.760]   The site that's on your screen right now,
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:32.640]   it's still being TDOS as far as the--
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:34.640]   I know some people at Cloudflare I could hook you up with
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:35.240]   if you want.
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:35.600]   All right.
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:38.240]   We may not be a happy nation builder right now.
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:39.920]   But if you want to support us, you
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:42.840]   can go to supportbrianna.com.
[02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:44.040]   That's still up.
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:44.560]   Nice though.
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:45.840]   For the moment.
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:47.440]   For the moment.
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:50.280]   I is so frustrating, so frustrating.
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:51.880]   Let's have a conversation.
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:52.800]   Let's talk.
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:56.400]   Let's not hide in the shadows and be jerky jerks.
[02:19:56.400 --> 02:19:58.480]   I agree.
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:01.440]   Lisa Schmeiser was the best name on this show.
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:03.560]   Editor ITPro today.
[02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:07.240]   She's @elschmeiser on the Twitter.
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:08.440]   Always a pleasure.
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:08.760]   Thank you.
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:09.840]   Love having you on the show.
[02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:11.560]   Thank you for your insights.
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:14.280]   And of course, the fabulous Mark Millian, who
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:16.800]   I've known since he was a small child.
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:18.040]   Technology editor.
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:19.480]   Not true.
[02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:21.320]   Well, since you were like 20 something,
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:23.240]   like you were 21 or something when you started on this,
[02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:23.880]   right?
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:27.480]   We used to have you on as the token young person.
[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:28.480]   Do I still account for that?
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:29.400]   Yeah, I think so.
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:31.360]   Technology, I still love you.
[02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:32.440]   Technology editor Bloomberg.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.440]   Always a pleasure.
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:34.760]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:36.280]   Thank you all for watching the show.
[02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:39.080]   It's really fun to do it with a live studio audience.
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:42.160]   We thank you guys for visiting from Arkansas.
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.760]   How did Shelley do?
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:44.320]   She all right?
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:46.440]   She survived?
[02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:48.200]   OK, good.
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:50.080]   She was the long suffering--
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:51.800]   every time we have visitors, there's usually
[02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:55.160]   a long suffering spouse and a fan.
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:58.040]   That's-- and so that was the long suffering spouse
[02:20:58.040 --> 02:20:59.280]   role for you today.
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:00.360]   Thank you for being here.
