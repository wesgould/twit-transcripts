[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   This is kind of, you've been having so much fun the last few weeks, putting together kind of specialty panels.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And this is the Brooklyn Hipster panel, I think.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I'm not sure there's Barretton Day.

[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   There you go.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   It's so good to have you, Barretton.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   It's good to be back.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   The paperback version of How to Be Black just out.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Just came out last week.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Everybody in the room gets a signed copy.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Really?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   We should have put them under the chairs.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I'm not Oprah.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   They would have gone crazy.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Also, here's not from Brooklyn, but Austin is the Brooklyn of Texas.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   There you go.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Well, you got the Brooklyn and then you got the Hipster.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So I'm here to represent Hipster.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Hipster represents.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yeah, look at that hair.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Brian Brushwood.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Good.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Get a little too old for the hair, dude.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Well, I'm a little too old for everybody.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I'm a little too old for podcasting, sir.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   By the way, oh, it's me, Kettle.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You're black.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Podcasting.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   My hobby.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And also Nick Biltness here.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   He actually is a reporter from the New York Times.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   A real reporter from a real place.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   The Brooklyn New York Times.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   The Brooklyn Times.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   There must be a Brooklyn Times.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   There are local papers.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   There are local papers.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   So first of all, Kudos.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And this here is Leo LePorte.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I guess you know who I am.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Kudos to you, Nick, because you've been doing amazing reports.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And I want to talk about your Scott Forstahl.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   You got inside.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Everywhere.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Everywhere.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You've got great sources.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Like little moles.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You've got nanobots.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   You've got nanobots.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   That's the chair from New York to cover Silicon Valley.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Correct.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I think it didn't take you very long to really get your tentacles into these companies.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   How did you do that?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Well, so I was on the other side of the planet before that, literally and figuratively.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I was a developer and a designer and I built stuff.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So they kind of get.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.440]   So yeah, so people, I can actually talk to them about the code.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.640]   I'm not a terrible programmer, which is why I don't do that anymore.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.280]   But I used to teach at NYU.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.840]   No, but it's credible when we were just talking about Google Plus.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.560]   You said there's no right API.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   That's credible.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   And people listen and they go, oh, he knows what he's talking about.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.760]   No, and I definitely, I've taken the tools I've learned from 10 years of building these
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.440]   things and now use them in reporting.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.440]   That's great.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.080]   You're a must read now that your next blog, it's in the bits part of the bits blog right
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.680]   in technology section on New York Times is must read a really great stuff.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.160]   You know, the other thing I think is there's a lot of people that play access journalism
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.080]   out here and I don't do that.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.160]   You know, they tell us about that because I have a, that's one of the reasons we're
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.200]   in Petaluma, not in San Francisco.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.920]   I don't want to have anything to do with these guys.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   What is access journalism?
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.440]   Well, so access journalism is where you are nice to a company or a person because you'll
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.440]   get access.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.840]   So a perfect example is people that are afraid of Apple because they won't get the iPad mini
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.640]   or the new iPhone early to be able to review it and then they don't get paid use and so
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   on.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.240]   And because we're the New York Times, we don't have to play that game and the Wall Street
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   Journal doesn't either.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   I choose not.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.200]   Well, but what's funny is Poe gets it early and Walt Mossberg gets it early anyway.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   Yes, exactly.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.280]   And both of them, let's face it, are fairly Apple.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.760]   But what a lot of bloggers don't realize is that these companies need them more than
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.240]   the bloggers need the companies and they don't realize that.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.400]   And if they were to just say, you know what, I'm just going to write whatever it is I want
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   to write.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.560]   And I don't get to review it early, but you know what, we're live.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.560]   It doesn't matter.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.560]   I'm going to review it day.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   I've got the mini on Friday, reviewed it then.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.080]   But so that's one of the things that we definitely do at the Times.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.920]   They also threatens the companies physically.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.360]   Yes, I've been making a couple of kneecaps.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.360]   Great boxer.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.160]   And you will be hurt.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   Really?
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   Emotionally.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.960]   It's like a lot of wiry and wiry.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   I got a lot of...
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.440]   Lancer weight, lighter than he looks.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   Bar fight weight.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   Bar fight weight.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440]   He's sucker punched people.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.320]   So you were in New York during Sandy.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.720]   You were out here, but you were a friend.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.920]   I was mis-cuttering and I was tweeting and I was doing everything I could to make sure
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.920]   I got the word.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   It was a fascinating...
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.320]   I was actually sad to not be there because I was there on 9/11.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   I was there during the blackout.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   I was there during Irene.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.480]   But what's different, and I think we say this every time, but I think it really was
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.600]   true, is that the real news coverage is no longer in mainstream media on this kind of
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   sense.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   Well, it's no longer exclusively.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   Correct.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   You have to go...
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   Well, we were just talking about MSNBC.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.160]   And you said, I don't know, they said, "I've got an exclusive."
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.800]   Yeah, it was a local channel that had made this claim of, "We've got this exclusive information."
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   And on that bit of information, it was not exclusive.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.960]   Of course, we have a Twitter about Twitter now earlier.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.000]   And in general, it's unlikely that you do.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.800]   Because if you know of somebody else who's probably already shared it on some social
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   stream, it's from one.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.040]   It seems that we say this every time there's a major event that because there's people
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.840]   on the ground using Twitter to report, this is first person.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.840]   And you can't...
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.840]   The scale of...
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.720]   I mean, you basically have a distributed journalistic force.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.000]   They're not all trained, but they're creating the sharing images, the sharing updates.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Yep.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   You have real data coming in.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.800]   But then there's also one reporting team can't replicate thousands of people showing
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   their direct experience.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.960]   But then there's also is Twitter wrong, the Tumba log, where you have to look and see,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.600]   "Oh, okay, there weren't sharks."
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   It turns out...
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   Well, that's...
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.760]   You had an actual report that there were sharks?
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   Well, there were photos.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.000]   Pictures of... they tweet the pictures of the day after tomorrow and say, "Tidal wave takes
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Manhattan."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And then they take pictures...
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.600]   I forget there was one actually, it was quite funny.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.520]   It was a shark and a scuba diver under the subway.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.200]   Well, some of them are not credible, but most of...
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.120]   I mean, obviously, this is the day after tomorrow.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.360]   Yeah, statue liberty was not being wiped out by a tidal wave.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.120]   What's funny is someone actually took the time to put the New York one logo.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.120]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120]   Creative.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.320]   That's commitment to deception.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.320]   Commitment to deception.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.040]   But this is my question.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.800]   Yes, Twitter has a lot of information.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.440]   Here's the shark, which by the way, it says I'm verified here was later found to be fake.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   What...
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.680]   Yeah, it's the information, but half of it's...
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.120]   Well, so, I mean, the ratio of false to true is rather low.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120]   I think.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   Really, you think it's mostly true.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   Absolutely.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.600]   I mean, think about the things that you saw.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.520]   It was the same 10 images that day after tomorrow.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.920]   And you'll see them in the next hurricane.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   It'll be an eventually...
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.320]   So it's demonstrably fake and so who cares?
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.160]   But at the same time, I think that what happened was that there was a...
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.440]   As David Carr, my colleague, says, "The internet on Twitter, it's a self-cleaning oven."
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.440]   Right?
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.440]   People immediately tried to...
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   But this site exists.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.440]   Yeah, these sites exist.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.680]   What's his name from the Atlantic, Alexis Madrigal set up a site where he was literally
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   live.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   That was fantastic.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680]   It was fantastic.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.800]   In fact, that's where these real and fake stamps on these pictures come from as Alexis
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   is said in the long way.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.760]   And the really smart thing that he was doing was he was going and he was taking the pictures
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.640]   and running them backwards through Google Image Search and he would say, "Oh, this is
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.880]   actually a screenshot from this.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.160]   This is a photo from seven months ago.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.160]   This is real."
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.200]   So the tool of self-correction is built in, even though that is a risk.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.720]   The speed works to the advantage of misinformation for a time.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.240]   So I read about this for my colleagues' week and I interviewed the author of this book
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.080]   about lying and he was saying, "Everyone lies.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   Politicians lie.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   Stores lie.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080]   Corporations lie.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.080]   Everyone lies."
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:27.720]   What is different is that people now can have the lies is actually accountable to at least
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   a username.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.240]   It may not necessarily be a person, but it is a username.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   And also, there are people that have the ability to correct this quicker than they ever would
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   have had before.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.800]   Twitter's efficient role, you call it, in guarding the truth.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.040]   Actually, you didn't call it that.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.040]   Some headline here.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.040]   Some headline.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   Nick's been...
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.960]   Because we've been talking a little bit about previous stories where the headline often
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   was kind of sensational.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.320]   Even the times, which is not bad.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.640]   Or rewritten in a way to be understandable, but not quite accurate.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.640]   Some people write for us.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.600]   Yeah, some people write for people to be able to get into the story quicker.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   Right.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   No, it's a different job for a headline than it is the reporter, obviously.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   Correct.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   And people should know that.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.520]   I think it's not, maybe not commonly known, but headline writers, that's a job.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.680]   So what was really fascinating to me about the hurricane coverage on Twitter and focusing
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.680]   on that was the images that were flowing in from people were just fascinating.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.280]   They were just, I mean, some really breathtaking images.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.400]   But what time did was they sent out five real photojournalists that are paid to be photojournalists
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   with their iPhones and Instagram and they shot images.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.880]   And those were some of the images that stood out more.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.840]   And so you have, for me, one of the most beautiful images and haunting images was the
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   picture of the carousel.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840]   Did you see that?
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   With the water rising up.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.240]   The water had risen, James Carousel on the Brooklyn side, which was just taken by someone,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.960]   just a random citizen journalist, if you will.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.040]   And then there were pictures by these photojournalists and you can see this world where
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.880]   these things are colliding and, but they're all telling the story.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   They both have a role.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880]   Absolutely.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.360]   I mean, we're not eliminating professionals.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   Nope.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.880]   And that's evident by the time photos standing out.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.640]   So we're not eliminating those people, but at the same time, people have the ability to
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.560]   be able to share the things that they see from every street, every corner, every basement.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   What was fascinating for me is when you, there's obviously an advantage to professional,
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.800]   you know, journalistic operations, but there's a physical limit to how much you can cover.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.880]   And so much of the story, Nick and I talked a little bit about this on the ride up was
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.800]   focused on Manhattan because you want, you had to split cities.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   I think the first of the media capital.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   No, exactly.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.400]   Well, yeah, in the center.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:39.200]   But there, you know, the scale of devastation was much larger in Staten Island and Rockaway
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.600]   Park and Rockaway, the Far Rockaway and the beach and being able, you can find those stories
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   online now too.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.160]   And so there was someone had started a great discussion on Facebook about why aren't we
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.360]   seeing this coverage and people just started pouring in with the images, with the coverage,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   with the images.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.520]   And you see not only in documentation, but in relief efforts, you know, occupies done
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.760]   a super organized job down at the edge of Brooklyn where you don't see as much red cross
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.760]   activity.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.880]   So speaking of the coverage, right now we're beyond the, the initial coverage during the
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.080]   storm phase and now we're in the interpretation phase and the story of recovery.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.600]   Like is anyone else super annoyed that ever that there are so many media publications
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.880]   and so many people making hay tying the single data point with global warming?
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.200]   Is anyone else annoyed by that?
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.520]   I mean, I take it that you're a global warming denier, right?
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.400]   No, no, no, I've got no stake in the thing, but it pisses me off.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.980]   I'm somebody who as a magician back in the 70s, there is a guy named Yuri Geller who
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.060]   claimed to have psychic powers and could bend spoons with his minds.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.300]   And one of the tricks he would do after bending a spoon in front of everything, he would say,
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:47.460]   now all of you go out and look for, look for watches that were stopped that have started
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.460]   happening now.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.780]   My psychic powers have caused this to happen and everyone would go out and they'd find these
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.660]   little knick knacks, oh, this, this old watch wasn't working.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.660]   Now it's working.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.420]   It must have been your psychic powers and the phone lines would light up for it.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.260]   It's, it's a, it's a magic trick to keep the systems.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.660]   No, it's with his mind, of course, right?
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.540]   No, I understand that, right?
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.900]   You're saying correlation is not equal causation.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.220]   But it also goes both ways.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:14.660]   It annoys me when Fox News starts saying coldest day in eight years, where's your global warming
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.660]   now?
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:21.080]   And when, when either side validates it, they're part of the problem because it's unscientific
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.780]   and it only gives validity to the other side.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.980]   I just want all of those assholes to stop it.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.340]   Well, here's, I read a piece in some science journal this week that basically said, can
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.700]   we say that this storm is a result of global warming?
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.700]   Of course not.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.700]   Obviously not.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:43.420]   But can we, we, over time, the fact that we're seeing more of these storms, these combination
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.580]   effects, the scale, the breadth, the impact, the economic losses growing.
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.740]   Yes, that is the trend as a result of a change.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.620]   You can also say that a warmer Atlantic, which is demonstrably the case does.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.940]   These increase the strength of sand.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.660]   So any specific storms, scientifically, you can't say, yeah, that's a global warming
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.660]   storm.
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.660]   And that's not.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.500]   But the fact that these are stronger over time and in general is the, that's just it.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.420]   Is the only way to analyze a statistical trend is to look at the statistical trend.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.380]   Anytime you point to a single data point and interpret it with that lens, you do harm to
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.220]   the public understanding of science.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.340]   But people don't experience trends, right?
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.380]   They experience single data points.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.980]   They experience a loss today.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.100]   There's plenty of political hate to be made for it.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.300]   And sure, never let a good disaster go to waste.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.540]   But that's the problem.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:38.100]   That's why we have a scientifically illiterate public is because we keep, we can't resist
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.820]   on both sides taking advantage of a tragedy on one side or the other to, to essentially
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.820]   ideify, idiot to fi everybody at home.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.820]   But I understand.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.820]   Let's say there were global warming and it were, the issue may be not global warming
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.220]   but whether what's a cause.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.580]   But let's say there were just, just bear with me for this.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.980]   Let's say there were global warming.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.100]   What you would have is a series of increasingly strong climactic results that you couldn't
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.460]   individually point to global warming.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.420]   But at some point you have to say, well, something's going on.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.540]   And so that's, it's, it's, it's, I read a great speech and I'm trying to find it.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:22.100]   I can't find it about if you were going to pick the hardest thing you could pick to demonstrate,
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.380]   it would be something that takes thousands of years.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.580]   It's very, very difficult.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:32.620]   And, but on the other hand, it's also, if, if there is global warming and the planet
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.860]   is dying, we kind of need to know that, you know what I'm saying?
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.420]   And we kind of have to act upon it.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.420]   No, absolutely.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.220]   So it's appropriate to start looking for evidence, not stopped clocks.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.940]   I understand why the issue stop clocks is germane.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.860]   But, and understand, okay, here's my rule, right?
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.140]   This is the Brian Brushwood rule.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:54.660]   You are allowed to make political hay on a specific data point for a specific storm.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.180]   You're able to blow it up.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:01.820]   But that means you can't complain when the Republicans make hay over a big snowstorm or
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.780]   being a particularly cold year.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.780]   You're either going to play the game, but that's just brain dead because that doesn't
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.780]   work.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.260]   That doesn't support the scientific fact of the trend.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.980]   You know, wait, I think that we, this is, this is fascinating stuff, but shouldn't we
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.580]   be talking about the iPad mini?
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.740]   If only we can show hurricane photos on the day.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.740]   Speaking of global warming.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.500]   All right, we're going to take a break and come back with more.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.940]   Brian Brushwood is here representing the libertarian south of the United States of America.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.940]   Brooklative Texas.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.940]   The Brooklative Texas.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.380]   Actually, you know, you don't really, you shouldn't be, you should be in Dallas, not
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.380]   Austin.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.380]   What are you doing?
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.380]   Oh my God.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.380]   Dallas is a bunch of frat douchebags.
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.380]   Forget about those guys.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.940]   And then it goes half your followers.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.900]   Way to go, way to go.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.900]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.300]   Maybe Fort Worth, isn't that where the West begins?
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:58.020]   I think, I know, I do know, I found out this recently that, that El Paso is closer to California
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.180]   than it is to Dallas.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.180]   That's how big Texas is.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.180]   That doesn't work.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.180]   That doesn't work.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.180]   As you drive into Dallas.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.180]   Can we just give a shout out to a friend real quick?
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.180]   Yeah, of course.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.180]   Ashley Granada is watching.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.180]   Hey, what's up Ashley?
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.180]   Say hi to Ashley.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.180]   She's good peeps.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.180]   Good.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.180]   Leo does the perry.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.180]   She doesn't play a mask.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.020]   I was trying to see that one that was a mask.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.020]   I went to Burning Man with Ashley.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.980]   I'm trying to put Live.Twit on Google+, but it just doesn't seem to want to go.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.980]   They try to block us.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.980]   Is that what it is?
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.980]   They don't like you?
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.980]   No, I don't know why that is.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.780]   I don't want to start a bad rumor.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.180]   Alright, let's also hear Mr. Baratunde Thurston.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.180]   Yup.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.980]   Escape from New York was successful.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.980]   You're on a tour?
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.980]   Are you on a book tour?
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.980]   I'm on a constant tour.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.980]   You are.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.980]   It's the permanent campaign.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.980]   You don't even have a home anymore.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.980]   I'm promoting the book some.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.980]   I've been hustling for Obama heavily around the place online and off.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.660]   We're going down to Tuesday and I've been hopping around the world as I generally do.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.020]   So what is the feeling in the Obama campaign?
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.220]   I think it's going to be close.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.220]   Do they want it?
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.220]   I mean, it's obviously close.
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.660]   I think that's the definite case.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.700]   It comes, polls are meaningless this close to the event and it's about turnout.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.100]   So arguments are done.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.780]   So we have to give Baratunde some major props here.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.900]   Baratunde is staying with me for a couple of days, but he's not going to be staying
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.460]   with me on Monday night because he's taking a red eye back to New York to vote and then
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.460]   flying back right after him.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.460]   Oh, good man.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.740]   Because the storm to bring him back to Sandy threw off my absentee.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.740]   They're actually letting us know.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.980]   I'm getting a lot of people in New Jersey facts.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:17.980]   I saw that.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.180]   I saw that the governor tweeted it.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.180]   It's awesome.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.180]   The one time you wanted to live in New Jersey.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.180]   I did.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.180]   I said it on the show.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.340]   I was like, I never thought I'd say this, but I love it.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.060]   I wish I live in New Jersey today.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.060]   I've already voted.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.060]   I've already voted.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.060]   I tried to already vote.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.060]   I am the mail.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.060]   The mail got washed away.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   Where are you?
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.060]   Where are you?
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.060]   Here, right here in beautiful California.
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.060]   In Petaluma?
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.060]   Petaluma, California.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.060]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.060]   I love you.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.060]   Been in Petaluma for?
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.340]   I like it here.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.540]   But for me, getting back to that Access Journalism, it was really important for me
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.540]   to get out of this journalism in Petaluma.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.040]   Get out of the bubble.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.420]   Not go to the parties, not hang out with the PR people, not hang out with the company.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.420]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.420]   Because it's hard to say something bad about somebody you like and know.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.420]   No, it's difficult.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.420]   It is.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.420]   Absolutely.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.420]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.420]   Nick Pilton is also here.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.980]   The journalist journalist, he's doing such great work at the New York Times.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.740]   We're talking more about the mini.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.740]   You got a mini with you.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.740]   We're talking about the mini.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.340]   You want to hear your opinion about that?
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.100]   I'm digging the mini.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.620]   You could talk about it too if you want.
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.620]   I will talk about everything.
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.620]   All right.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.620]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.140]   But first, a word from our friends at Citrix, they do that great remote access program.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.060]   I recommend and I'm going to be using in Australia.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:29.060]   Let me tell you, when you run your own business, the idea of taking a vacation, it's not, it's
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.380]   just, you don't even think of it because what's going to happen when I'm gone.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.540]   So, I needed to, I needed to get out of town.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.220]   I'm actually a little frayed and go to my PC is going to mean that I can at least get
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.220]   back to the office computer.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.060]   I can check the email, send email from my office account.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:51.740]   I can, if I, you know, I'm doing presentations on the trip and I will inevitably leave some
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.220]   data behind on the computer.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.660]   I can get it even on my iPad or my iPhone or I try it on the mini.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.940]   It works great on the mini.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.340]   I want you to try it yourself right now free for 30 days.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.740]   Visit go to my PC.com.

[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.620]   It's the fastest one out there.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.020]   You can use any web browser to access your computer at work.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.020]   Try it free.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.940]   Just use the offer code TWIT for 30 days free and then the apps for the iPhone, the iPad,
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.700]   the Android tablets, they're free as well.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.020]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.020]   We think the folks is.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.020]   Do it.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.020]   Do it.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.020]   Do it.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.020]   Do it.
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.020]   Do it.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.020]   Why haven't you done it?
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.020]   You're sitting there listening and you're not doing it.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.020]   I'll tell you why.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.020]   I know why.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.140]   Because they're waiting because they got that 30-day trial and they're going to wait till
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.140]   vacation.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.140]   It's Thanksgiving's coming.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.540]   You'd like to go home.
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.940]   Maybe you go home on Wednesday.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.700]   Instead of waiting till Thursday, that kind of thing.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.740]   You could probably chime in via that iPad mini.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.740]   There you go.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.740]   Oh, oh.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.060]   Speaking of the mini, it's here.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.060]   Came on Friday.
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.700]   Apparently he sold out already.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.700]   Sold out already, yes.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.540]   Apparently you could get one at Stockton.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.500]   Do you know where Stockton is?
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   Not from here.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.500]   That's got a cattle.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.500]   Road trip.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.060]   I had an Omolic had to go and send, had to go and get one at Stockton.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.060]   He was having such a hard time.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.780]   He wanted one that bad.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.380]   Well, I think I'm going to wait.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.380]   I was like, you're not going to wait.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.380]   Just get it.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.380]   And he's like, okay, I'm going to get it.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.900]   But all you need to know is the Wi-Fi.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.900]   Black or white?
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.900]   Black or white?
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.900]   Or you can spray paint it.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.900]   You got the white.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.900]   There's no 3G.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.260]   There's 3G, but that comes at the end of the month.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.420]   So I have the black one here.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.420]   Oh, the white cover.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.420]   Just couldn't wait.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.460]   So I have to say, I've never believed that the iPad was a mobile device.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.740]   It's too heavy in today.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.740]   It's too heavy.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.740]   It's too big.

[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:35.740]   It's a very well-turbed laptop.
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:42.740]   It's a very well-turbed laptop.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:49.740]   It's a very well-turbed laptop.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:56.740]   It's a very well-turbed laptop.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:03.740]   It's a very well-turbed laptop.
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:10.740]   It's a very well-turbed laptop.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:17.740]   It's a very well-turbed laptop.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:24.740]   It's all of Gawker down.
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:31.740]   They're sponsored by State Farm.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:38.740]   They're sponsored by State Farm.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.740]   With their phone number to call in for your claims.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.740]   It was pretty smart.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.740]   That's clever.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:42.740]   Yeah, very clever.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.740]   I wonder if State Farm knows what their sponsor is.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.740]   Oh no, they do.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.740]   The Glauker Media Brand is one of the biggest on online.
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.740]   Yeah, they do it.
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:51.740]   They do it.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:52.740]   Glauker Gizmodo.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.740]   Gizmodo is one of the first tech sites.
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.740]   Yeah, Gizmodo's big.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.740]   So Squarespace.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.740]   Oh yeah, what was I saying?
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.740]   You were about to sell some product.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.740]   Anyway, that's what I call commitment.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.740]   Squarespace is hosting.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.740]   The best hosting, hosting that really cares
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.740]   about keeping your site up and running.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.740]   But it's also the best software.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:13.740]   I really think that that's a key to what Squarespace has done.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:18.740]   They've got this new Squarespace 6, which is modernizing the Squarespace stuff so that
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.740]   it uses adaptive design.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.740]   It's called a response of design so that when you visit it, no matter what, this makes
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.740]   sense.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.740]   We used to have a mobile site and a desktop site.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.740]   What about a WAP site?
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.740]   What about the WAP site?
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.740]   WAP, remember that?
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.740]   This is all for mobile, right?
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.740]   That's what it is.
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.740]   And it was crazy to have two different sites.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.740]   I still have two different sites on one of my blogs.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.740]   Squarespace, like any modern company, which is a real handful in the business, said,
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:42.740]   "Wait a minute.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.740]   What if we just had one site that sizes itself intelligently to the platform?"
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.740]   And so when you get a Squarespace site, it looks great on anything from an iPhone, even
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:55.740]   like one of these mini iPhones to a 27-inch Dell XBS.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.740]   I mean, it's incredible.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.740]   And it all is done automatically.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.740]   When you, for instance, when you upload an image, it automatically sizes that image, I think,
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.740]   seven different versions of it for every possible.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.740]   So here's what you do.
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.740]   Go to squarespace.com and just take our test drive.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.740]   It costs you nothing.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.740]   No credit card needed.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.740]   You're going to start by picking your template.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.740]   If you're a photographer, you'll notice some really gorgeous portfolio templates.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:23.740]   I shouldn't say photographer, artist, designer, anybody who wants a portfolio.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.740]   This is a really great place for that.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.740]   And then once you get your site, you can import all your data.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.740]   So they want people like photographers to be featured on there?
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:39.740]   Yeah, they have a big push of artists and designers because they're portfolio management.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.740]   It's kind of beautiful.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.740]   And you know why?
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.740]   People go, a lot of photographers, unfortunately, go to these specialized companies that do
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.740]   photography.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.740]   And they're terrible.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.740]   They don't keep up with technology.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.740]   They're not responsive.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.740]   There's all this stuff that...
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.740]   You guys remember Flickr?
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.740]   I heard about that.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.740]   What happened to that?
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.740]   Apparently...
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.740]   I want to ask you what Marissa's up to too.
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.740]   You probably have insight.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.740]   I know Kara Swisher gets every memo.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.740]   Well, Kara works for Yaw's.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.740]   She works for Yaw's.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.740]   She runs a little blog on the side.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.740]   There's something she's got going on.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:12.740]   Anyway...
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:15.740]   But I have a suggestion from Marissa on Flickr.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.740]   I'd love to hear it.
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.740]   I'd love to hear it.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:22.740]   Meanwhile, if you are a photographer, probably you're not using Flickr for your portfolio.
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:23.740]   No, I use my personal site now.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:24.740]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:25.740]   Well, this is a great place to do it.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.740]   It's surfing.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:27.740]   And...
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.740]   Okay, Nick, I don't know what you're paying for your site or what you're paying for that specialized photography site.
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:35.740]   But okay, after you do the 14-day trial, if you decide to buy, look at this.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.740]   There's two plans.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:37.740]   It's very simple.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.740]   It's a standard plan.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.740]   This is when you pay for a year, so $8 a month for a year.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.740]   $16 for unlimited.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.740]   This is what you want.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:47.740]   Unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited bandwidth.
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   I don't know of any other hosting companies.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.740]   It's truly unlimited.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:51.740]   I mean, that's crazy talk.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.740]   It's the no-limit plan.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.740]   Unlimited storage.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.740]   Now, this is important.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.740]   Files are limited to 20 megs in size.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.740]   Ah, so it's not unlimited.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.740]   Found a new goal.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.740]   No, Nick and I have as many 20 megs as you want.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.740]   But you can't...
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.740]   Fusted, fair.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.740]   Do that.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.740]   Yes.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.580]   Five gigabytes file up there and say everybody down.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.580]   And unlimited contributors.
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.220]   I'm going to the FTC and complaining about it.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.220]   No, unlimited.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.220]   They put...
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.220]   They said it's right here.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.220]   No, they don't bury it in the small print.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.780]   I think that's really fair.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.020]   Anyway, this is a great deal.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.820]   You also get MailChimp Sync, Google Apps Sync, Facebook Pages, Publishing, Form Builder,
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.820]   great support.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.500]   And when you buy a year plan, you'll get the domain name free and they'll hook it all
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.500]   up for you.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.100]   Import your content from all of the existing sites.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.100]   Except...
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.100]   I had a big hiccup.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.300]   And I've talked to them.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.940]   I was one of the rare squares.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.460]   From my Squarespace 5 to my Squarespace 6.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.940]   And that's because of the responsive design.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.940]   You have to read design.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.620]   I just didn't pull in the actual data.
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.620]   They fixed that, I think.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.620]   Okay.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.620]   The data...
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.620]   They said they had a dozen...
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.620]   But you have to redo the design.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.100]   I was one of the rare people that got caught up in that.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.980]   But they gave you good service, I hope?
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.740]   Yeah, no, they've been very responsive.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.260]   Are you happy you're on the Squarespace 6?
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.740]   Because I was thinking about jumping over.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.020]   Well, my personal one still is...
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.300]   I made a new site on 6 as a part of the project.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.060]   That's probably what you should do.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.420]   I should tell you, if you have an old Squarespace site, you should probably create a new site
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.060]   for 6 and migrate it over to that.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.220]   Because in fact, you have to.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.420]   And that's just because of the technology.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.340]   When you're moving from one to one.
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.140]   Well, they'll do it for me.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.140]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.380]   You're not offering to do it for you?
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.980]   That has not happened.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.980]   Squarespace.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.980]   We can take care of my...
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.980]   Seriously.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.900]   That's the power of the before they care of my friend here.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.900]   You literally just stuck his...
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.700]   No, you'll get an email before the show's over.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.700]   I can't believe that.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.660]   No, no, no, we're going to take care of you.
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.660]   Squarespace.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.660]   I'll do that for you.
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.660]   Squarespace.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.660]   That pays to be in the studio.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.660]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.660]   I forgot to mention this.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.980]   When you buy, Nick, you should do this.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.060]   Use Twit 11 as the offer code to save 10% off the first purchase.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.060]   Okay, done.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.060]   Twit 11.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.060]   That's for the month 11, right?
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.060]   October.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.060]   Wait, 10%.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.060]   That means if I made an order of $10 billion, I'd save like...
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.060]   One billion dollars.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.060]   Wow, it's amazing.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.060]   You'll buy more.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.060]   You'll save more.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:09.020]   I don't think there's any way that you could actually make a billion dollar order for Squarespace.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.020]   But try.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.020]   You can make it that way.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.620]   I want to buy all the sites.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.620]   Just like all the sites.
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.900]   Should we start a Kickstarter?
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.900]   Let's do it.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.900]   A billion dollars.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.180]   I want to save a billion dollars, please.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.060]   What do we got?
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.220]   So you had some great reporting on Scott Forestol.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.660]   Yeah, my colleague and I, Nick Winkefield, who is the Apple beat reporter at the New York
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.820]   Times.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.820]   So you just wrote it.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.460]   He got all the scoops.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.460]   No, we worked together.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.460]   We're teaming.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.460]   We're team work.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.460]   It's teasing you.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.460]   That's what you great.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.460]   He does.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.460]   I'm not going to tease him anymore.
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:38.460]   Man, Leo's feisty today.
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.460]   He's digging on Nick built and he tells me I'm too old for my hairstyle.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.380]   He's making fun of my shirt.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.380]   I'm going to catch the baby.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.860]   So he's going to tell Bartender he's really white.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.860]   There you go.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.860]   I'm waiting for the comments.
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:48.860]   It's pretty great.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.860]   Let's go Nick back to him.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:50.860]   I know it.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:51.860]   There's always a moment.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:52.860]   There's always a moment.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.860]   They egged me.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.860]   I've done.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.860]   But you allowed yourself to be egged.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.860]   Should you go?
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:57.860]   Should we go?
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.860]   I think we should be.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.860]   He's hugging me for those.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:00.860]   He's not looking at home.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.860]   Let me kiss me.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.860]   Let's go back to scumorphicism.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.860]   Scumorphic design.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:15.860]   I hope you're right that Scott Forstall was the single sole advocate after the death
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.860]   of Steve Jobs for this crappy he was.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.860]   He was there stitching.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.860]   It's horrible.
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.860]   He was the, should I tell us like a news reporter?
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.860]   This week Scott Forstall of Apple was kicked out by Johnny Ive.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.860]   Was it Johnny Ive you think?
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.860]   No, so Johnny Scott.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   I said they could even go to a meeting together.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.860]   So let's, you want to go behind the scenes?
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.860]   Let's do it.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860]   Go inside out.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.860]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.860]   Don't do it.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.860]   Don't do it.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.860]   So Scott and Johnny, not big fans of each other.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.860]   And according to people close to the matter who could not be named because they're not allowed
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.860]   to speak publicly by the company.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:48.780]   So we have to say in the New York Times, there were times that there were meetings about
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:53.540]   the same thing where Scott would meet with these people and his team and then Scott and
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.340]   his team would leave and Johnny would come in with his team and leave and we're getting
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.340]   conflicting messages from the two different teams.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.940]   Well, these are some of the, I mean of course they get conflicting messages from Apple
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.060]   period because it's a difficult company to work with.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:13.340]   But the reality is Scott, so Steve was a huge fan of Schumorffi design.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.340]   Six started with Steve.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.340]   Oh, without a doubt.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.340]   And I think Scott was Steve Scott.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.340]   Yeah, because he came over with him from next.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.340]   Yes.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.740]   I would just like for the audience for you to define Schumorffi design.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.420]   Schumorffi design is essentially, and the nerds are going to pick on me because I'm probably
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.980]   going to, like, they'll be a, I'll use it.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.980]   The nerds always pick up.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.700]   There'll be a period in the wrong place.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.700]   When you refer to them as the nerds.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.940]   That's always a straight way to embrace you.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.420]   You mean our chat room?
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.140]   When nerds attack.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:43.020]   So Schumorffi design is essentially like an example is Steve Jobs loved the leather stitching
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:47.820]   and the leather on his private jet and he wanted it to be, he wanted it in part of the,
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.820]   of the Apple OS.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.780]   So they put it in the calendar, I believe.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.780]   Or whatever it was.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.660]   So you see the leather stitching.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.140]   Another example is, this is some pretty bad examples, but there's like radio where you
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.460]   have the radio dial or you have, you have buttons that are turnable.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:06.740]   So Schumorffi design can kind of blend between the actual user interface and the design.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.980]   The idea was like originally.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.660]   The dribble has got some great examples by the idea.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.660]   Oh, yes.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.660]   Fantastic.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.820]   Oh, and this is, these are real for the most part.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.540]   Yeah, there's some, some, some great stuff in there.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.540]   And they're just terrible.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.540]   I mean, most of them are terrible.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.380]   And the idea was that, and it's really, it actually was smart in the early days because
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.300]   people didn't know what computers were and people come to UI.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.700]   And so you see this dialed as a button that you press and it makes sense.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.020]   And you're like, ah, I feel good.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.020]   I feel the arm.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.020]   Okay.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:37.340]   But now, so if you look at the last few versions of the iTunes logo, for example, it always
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.140]   was a CD, right?
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.820]   But now go and find like a 12 year old and ask them if they know what a CD is and they're
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.020]   going to be like, what is that?
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.380]   Why is that round thing on that?
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.380]   Why are you pegging your designs?
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.300]   No, no, no, this is not even a joke.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.380]   We had a four year olds or I'm sorry, an eight year olds birthday party that we were
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.860]   attending and we had to explain to the girl, they're doing some kind of hot potato thing.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:59.620]   And we had to explain that you couldn't tilt the thing while the disc was spinning inside
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.180]   because there was a physical object in there spinning your totally vehicles while you're
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.180]   playing the game.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.980]   I love the way you just described it.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.980]   Why is it spinning?
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.980]   Why is it spinning?
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.260]   There's no reason for that.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.020]   So the, so jobs is a big fan of it.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.140]   And I think it worked for a long time, but eventually you have to kill the thing that
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.140]   is great, right?
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.300]   You have to, you know, you have to cannibalize yourself.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.100]   And I think Johnny, if you look at the, look at this design of this beautiful machine and
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.500]   this beautiful, I mean, when he sits up there and his British accent, he goes, it's the
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.780]   most beautiful iPhone we've ever made.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.780]   He's not kidding.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.540]   Like these are these, the designs of these things.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.860]   And he like, he's, you know, always focus on these things.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.380]   And apparently, and I don't know if we actually put this in our story, but I'm going to break
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.380]   some news here.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.380]   Exclusive.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.380]   So exclusive on Twitch.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:46.500]   So apparently Johnny is a big fan of, I mean, he thinks that the windows phone eight
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.460]   design is actually quite nice, right?
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.460]   And I think it is.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.140]   It is what we call digital native.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.140]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.780]   No longer refers back to the lock it.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.780]   Why not?
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.180]   And Scott apparently thought it was crap.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.980]   And, and so there was that.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.780]   And then there was, there was a lot of the stuff that happened with Apple Maps.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:07.300]   And apparently there was a big meeting with the execs and they wanted to put it out in
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:13.620]   apology and Tim Cook asked Scott to sign it and Scott refused, which is what we reported.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.340]   And, and Scott also just didn't play well with others.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.860]   Now, all Malek said, I couldn't get any of my sources to confirm that this was the issue,
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.740]   but the part about signing the letter.
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.660]   I think that was one of them, but there's been a lot of, there's been a lot of tension.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.660]   It makes sense.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.660]   So you're the CEO.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.660]   You, you want this apology.
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.860]   You're going to do this apology.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:35.220]   And when you're forced to sign it yourself because the guy responsible for iOS said, and
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.220]   I am not signing it.
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.220]   And I am not.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.220]   Here's an example.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:42.620]   This is this photo booth in snow leopard, which is fairly clean and simple.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.180]   Here's photo booth in Lyon.
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.180]   Oh, it's all.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.180]   That red velvet curtains.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.180]   Exactly.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.180]   It's got a one with irritates me.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.180]   And gay.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.980]   So what, so what is center is awful?
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.980]   Green Bayes.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.100]   It makes me not want to have fun.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.620]   Games that looks like seeing that is a fun.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.620]   It's totally fun.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.620]   So it's in Scott's defense.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:04.300]   Scott single handedly, you know, was one of the people that put iOS where it is today.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.140]   There are hundreds of millions of people on I mean, 100 million devices.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:11.220]   You know, people point to Siri and maps as a debacle, but everything else has been
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.220]   hugely success.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.020]   And, you know, I think that when what happened when Steve was running the company, you can
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.660]   ask Walt Rieseckson, you know, Adam Lushinsky, all these guys that have written books on
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.420]   this, when Steve was running the company, he enjoyed and he liked and he promoted the
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.180]   tension within the eight and then the company.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.500]   He wanted that because he created created, created, created force.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.500]   And I think it worked.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.820]   Like when you have people that are like, you're more amazing and people are like, it
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.820]   sucks.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.820]   It works when you have a dictator.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.820]   Correct.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.820]   And say, you're right.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.820]   We're going to do it this way.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.820]   Right.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.860]   But if there's nobody with that strong leading it, it's very.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:48.580]   And so when Steve left, there was a giant power vacuum at Apple and which I stepped.
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.580]   I'm a man.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.580]   It's me.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.580]   It's me, everybody.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.500]   I'm actually the guy behind.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:58.500]   One of the stories was that Scott was very preening and grooming himself to be the next
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   CEO.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.500]   Yes.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.700]   Nobody else thought this, but he thought he should be the next.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.860]   And I've heard this from several sources, very senior people too.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.100]   And other people have reported it.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.020]   You know, he believed that he should have been CEO, not Tim.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.620]   So there's a problem right there.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.620]   And I think there's a problem right there.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:20.340]   And I think that, you know, and the thing with Scott, the thing with Scott was, I mean,
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.900]   we should have a map of you become CEO or you die.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.980]   That's probably true.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.980]   That's good.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980]   I love Schwood.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.380]   But what I mean, when I interviewed Walter Isaacson, did a Q&A with him after the book
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.380]   came out.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.780]   And the one of the things that he said that really stuck out with me was Steve Jobs was
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.980]   he was there was half of him that was this creative genius.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.500]   And there was half of him that was this technical genius, if you will, right?
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.700]   And there was also problems.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.700]   He's not the greatest guy ever.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.220]   But that was that was the gist of it.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:51.300]   And when you take Tim Cook and Johnny Ive and you put those two together, they are that.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.820]   So Johnny is the creative genius.
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.500]   Tim is the business genius.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.340]   And they together make what essentially Apple was with Steve Jobs.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.900]   And that's what you have now because Johnny I for the this is the first time in Apple.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.180]   I can remember somebody being in charge of everything.
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.180]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.780]   And I think that human interface design across all products makes sense.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.780]   Oh yeah, I think so.
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.860]   And I think that you'll start to see a much more beautiful and consistent user interface
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.820]   that spans every single part of the of the OS.
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:17.820]   And he knew more and a lot.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.820]   The iTunes guy is now responsible for software across the board.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.060]   Now do you think Scott needed to go?
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:26.940]   I mean, what is your sense of the there were reports?
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.380]   I think it was in your story.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.700]   In fact that people were celebrating.
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:34.340]   They were going to the bars and saying ding dong the witches dead when he was fired.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.540]   Yeah, there was somebody that said it's better than the Giants winning that was a source.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.700]   Which is that's a saying a lot, you know, coming from someone in California.
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.660]   There's one thing that really surprised me in the media coverage of this is people were
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:50.580]   saying, you know, maps was was a miss and then but then they they listed Syria as a black
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.380]   eye and I've never thought of Syria.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.020]   I'm somebody who's on the road always behind the wheel or you're riding my bike.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:01.540]   I use Siri nonstop and I find it in general really good.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.460]   And I was surprised that we didn't hear more Siri talk at the last.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.260]   I'll tell you why series of failure.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:13.460]   First of all, they bought a program Siri that did more than Siri does even today.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.900]   It never got out of beta.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.860]   The network has been highly unreliable.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:21.300]   So I don't know about you, Brian, but don't you find that at least some large percent of
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.420]   the time you try to communicate with Siri, she comes back saying, I'm sorry, I can't
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.420]   help you.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.420]   And it's not just a 3G thing.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.420]   It's Wi-Fi too.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.420]   Right.
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   Well, it's a series network.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.980]   And it happens almost exclusively is because of connectivity issues, not because you miss
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.300]   and that's what I'm saying.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.300]   No, it's not.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.620]   And I think that that's a common misconception that you're having connectivity issues.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.620]   It's North Carolina.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.620]   It's their data center is not responsive.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.540]   And I know that because it happens here when we have a very good connectivity.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:51.580]   You don't think it's a matter of the consumer product not being appreciated.
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.180]   You think it's a case where the infrastructure is not strong enough and that's why they're
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.580]   not continuing to build on it?
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.700]   I believe that's part of the problem.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.220]   You know, we I don't know, maybe Nick knows better what's going on, what the thinking
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.460]   is inside Apple, but Siri should be out of beta by now.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.860]   Siri should be better than it is by now.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:06.860]   It's just now.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.220]   Siri, you should be able to download personality.
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.220]   You should be able to download different personalities.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.220]   Oh, this is true.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.580]   Well, the thing, the night writer car, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to,
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.580]   you want to get to Siri.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.740]   I would pay for that.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:22.860]   If you look at, look, go back to all things D when they demoed Siri before it was purchased
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.540]   as Siri before it's purchased by Apple.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:28.100]   And there was these great things where you could say, you know, what are the five biggest
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.100]   lakes in California?
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:33.580]   Like, you know, what's the temperature in South Dakota compared to the temperature in
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.580]   North Carolina?
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.260]   Oh, there's a very, and they've stripped all these things out.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:40.820]   And I think that, you know, if they're going to do it in beta, do it in beta, like throw
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.900]   throw everything in there and let us like have fun and play with it or strip it out
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.820]   and say it's not in beta or whatever it is that you need to know.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.460]   I guess, Brian, that you're good.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.460]   You're good.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.220]   You could experience a series because you have limited severely what you try to do with
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.220]   it.
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.220]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.700]   I mean, you know what Siri's going to do well and what she's not going to do well.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:58.700]   Right.
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.700]   Right.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.700]   And I guess part of that, you know, it's very compartmentalized.
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:03.700]   You could do the parlor trick of asking, you know, what's the mass of Jupiter and it
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.500]   calls up, you know, the stuff from Wolfram Alpha.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:11.420]   And, but for sending texts, I very rarely have or dictate texts to me.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.980]   But when I'm out on my bike, I mean, there's, there's nothing I, you know, I got hands
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.180]   on the, on the handles.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.580]   I'm not able to do anything.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.480]   And it's a big pain in the butt to pull out the phone.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.100]   So I use it a lot for that.
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.620]   And it's there are times I send out texts.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.860]   I'm like, yeah, that's close enough.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.860]   Sure.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.860]   Whatever.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.180]   And that's the most time and you sometimes some wonderful art and auto corrects by accident.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.180]   But that's different.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.180]   That's nuanced.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.180]   That's the nuanced dictation.
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.680]   That's actually something different.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.980]   And it's not something Apple developed.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:41.700]   My failure has been like there's a certain level of, there's a certain service level
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.140]   that I expect.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.700]   And when it fails, then my trust in the system is degraded.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.260]   So I just, it becomes binary for me.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:53.180]   If it doesn't work 98 plus percent of the time, it works zero percent of the time.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.180]   Right.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:55.180]   Exactly.
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:58.540]   And then we're re-order transcription and it pings the server and gets me a little beautiful
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.660]   purple dots and it comes back with zero.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.940]   And I've just dictated a whole paragraph and it's gone.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.340]   It's like getting really sick of those thoughts.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.500]   Like I never did any.
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.100]   It's like I just did work with your turn.
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.260]   Like it's a partnership.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:14.780]   I think it's reasonable to say it isn't widely acknowledged as Siri as a flop and the fact
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:19.340]   that just not nearly as great as everybody's saying Scott Forest all flops maps and Siri.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.580]   I understand what you're saying, Brian.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.100]   It's like, well, really, is this was Siri such a flop?
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.660]   Well, I'll tell you what, man.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:25.660]   It's something I've wanted.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.740]   I mean, if you go back to listening to one of my first appearances on This Week in Tech,
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.980]   it was like, all I wanted was that microphone button on the keyboard so that I could start
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.540]   voice dictation and it took years for it to get there.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.900]   Now that it's here, I'm thrilled.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:44.260]   But, you know, I think I would say he was not fired over maps and so that's convenient,
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.260]   but that's not what I mean.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.540]   I mean, I think it was just it was it was everything.
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:52.260]   It was like, and I think that there was there was really a power vacuum going on an apple
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.820]   and there still will be and there still is.
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.820]   You know, there are.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:55.820]   We've seen this before.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.260]   Remember Google did a reorganization and somebody was left out of that, a woman named
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.260]   Marissa Meyer.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.700]   She was pushed down very far.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:09.100]   And it's not unusual, especially with a new CEO in this case, Larry Page, in this case,
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.580]   Tim Cook, to come in and put a stamp on a company.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.740]   Say, these are the people I trust.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.700]   This is how I'm going to and the organization is going to be a little bit different because
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.940]   I'm not Steve Jobs.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:17.940]   Correct.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:21.620]   And Apple, of course, wants to make sure that people know that it is run by Tim Cook.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.340]   That's really the bottom line.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.860]   That's the yeah, you got to he's got to sacrifice some of it.
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:30.620]   This is what every new king has to come in and establish dominance.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:35.220]   Well, there's another and sacrificing, you know, a high ranking member of the family to
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.380]   make an American clear.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.380]   And now you're born on a Tyrion Lannister on this.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.460]   That the buck stuff is like Zagros.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.460]   It's got a role.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.460]   You've got to always pay your debts.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.460]   All right.
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.900]   So let's do a little let's do a little foreshadowing here.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:50.260]   So Scott Forstoll, you know, he ran a very large part of an organization at one of the
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:51.260]   biggest companies in the world.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:52.260]   Oh, he works for me now.
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.180]   Where is after he works for a time?
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.180]   Where does he go now?
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.740]   What is next for Scott Forstoll?
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.220]   Is he going to develop the next lighting company because, you know, based on two more
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.060]   effective lights you Philips Hue.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.060]   That'll know.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.060]   Oh, what do we think?
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.060]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.060]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.140]   So Phillips has created a it's very expensive $200 for three light bulbs, but you have to
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:15.840]   get a kit that attaches to your ethernet and then and controls the light bulbs.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.780]   You can take a picture of something with your iPhone and say, I want this color.
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:22.940]   It's there RGB light bulbs and they will change the room to the color of the thing.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.100]   I take a picture of you baritone.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.100]   My room is dark.
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.100]   The hue Phillips.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.100]   I'm looking this up.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.100]   Because you come in as any.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.420]   Because in your room can look like baritone day.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:35.140]   Well, I mean, obviously the nation in the world have been clamoring for this for a decade.
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.500]   Outside of that single, you know, world establishing is very interesting.
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:44.420]   It's a little it's a little pricey, but the idea that you could program any color in your
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.220]   lights and you are not selling you never mind.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.220]   I have for you.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.220]   I want a list of demands of my life.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.220]   We'll have the wrong light.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:55.700]   Next time I bring a girl back to my place, it's just like it's so nice in here.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.700]   It's an official single man.
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:58.700]   It's going to run here.
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.700]   It's going to run here.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.700]   It's a hue lighting.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:01.700]   Yes, but you can sell that.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.940]   You can sell that.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:03.940]   You can sell it.
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:04.940]   How is hue spelled actually?
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.940]   HUE.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:06.940]   HUE.
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.940]   It's on the Apple store.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.100]   Philips search for Philips with one L.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.100]   What?
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.100]   Philips.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.100]   Philips Hue.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.580]   Because the thing is, is I can't get the lighting on on these lights in the studio, right?
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.180]   So I always end up looking pinker when I'm here.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.900]   Then I, and of course they make fun of me incessantly in the chat room.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:25.460]   But when I'm there in the studio, I look normal, but here I look like a pink monster.
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:26.700]   So I'm going to get these.
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.220]   I've ordered it, but there's three months out.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.620]   But the reason I know about this is we use RGB lights here.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.420]   They're very expensive professional lighting, but we can make the backdrop for instance any
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.140]   color that we want.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:38.140]   It's purple right now.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.140]   I can switch it to blue.
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.140]   There you go.
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.100]   Speaking of last week, I'm literally checking my email right now.
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.100]   I'm going to do a little bit of a Sunday chat.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.100]   I do not like do you know?
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.100]   The chat's going to see if you can do a baritone.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.060]   Look at more things than my meetings working on it.
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.540]   So I'm going to, I'm going to, you realize there's no way for Chad to do anything and
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.780]   not getting serious trouble for it.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:57.780]   We have an on racial moment.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.780]   I think we are.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:52:59.780]   I feel like.
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.780]   So I think, is it time to take over the show?
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:02.780]   I think it's time.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.780]   So Leo, don't you have a flight to catch?
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.780]   Yeah, let's watch out very well.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:05.780]   I'm going to ask you to buy.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.780]   I'm going to ask you to buy.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.780]   I'll try to do it.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.780]   It's back.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.780]   Occupied to it.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:10.780]   You did that last.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.780]   I was so much.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:12.780]   We could do that.
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:14.180]   I'll do after I do the last commercial.
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.180]   I'll get up and leave.
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.180]   Okay.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.180]   Cool.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.180]   And you're in charge.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.180]   Right.
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:20.180]   Should we debate the elections?
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.180]   I can be.
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.180]   I want to go back to your voting for Romney.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.180]   We know already that you're for Obama.
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.180]   You should not vote.
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.820]   The only way to throw away your vote is to vote.
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.300]   And so I recommend if you're in a lost state where it's already decided.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.300]   Whoa.
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.380]   Ryan, have you ever been in Scott Forstoll on my ballot?
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:35.380]   You know who's on the ballot?
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.220]   I don't know if she's on anybody else's.
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.020]   We got Rosanne Barr on our ballot.
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:40.020]   Oh yeah.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.020]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.020]   There you go.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.940]   No, Ryan, that's the tragedy of the commons.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.940]   That's a common fallacy.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.060]   Actually, I'm working on a project right now.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.660]   So as you know, and most people know, I left the onion some months ago and started a company.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:52.660]   And we miss you.
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:54.980]   So I'm now an entrepreneur and it's called Cultivated Wit.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.780]   We do comedy tech projects and we're doing this thing with Ford Foundation.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:58.780]   So I just want you to call it quit.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:53:59.780]   I am okay.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.820]   It's definitely not going to be called that.
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.780]   So we're working for?
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:04.780]   No, no.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:05.780]   Ford Foundation is a client.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:06.780]   Ford.
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:07.780]   Wow.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.700]   And we're doing this comedic shaming of non-voting friends.
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:11.700]   Thank you.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:12.700]   Shame on you, Schwud.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.700]   Shame on you.
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:14.700]   I can't even hear you.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.340]   I don't say, I don't say, first of all, everyone should know and vote on all of their
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.340]   local issues.
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.340]   Thank you.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.340]   And nobody does.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.420]   Everyone votes in the one like, because it's so confusing.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.420]   What is prop 1274?
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:27.140]   Oh, it's in the nine.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.340]   I'm using to operate a supercomputer in my hand every day.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.940]   I'm going to show you guys the one side you need to know.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:33.940]   Okay.
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:34.940]   Okay.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:35.940]   We're about to get schooled here.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.940]   This is just the one side you need to know.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.940]   You've heard of Wikipedia.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.300]   This is ballotpedia, ballotpedia.org.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:41.300]   Go to your state.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:44.700]   For instance, the ballot measures, Nick, you're saying in California, yes, very confusing.
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.620]   Click on California ballot measures.
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:47.620]   They list them all.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.780]   They list what they say.
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.300]   They list who spent money, pro and con.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.300]   They give all the editorial.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.300]   Well, would you look at that?
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.940]   This is nonpartisan and really good.
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:56.940]   How to be Wikipedia?
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.540]   Yeah, it's Wikipedia for voting.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:01.220]   And I just wish everybody who's voting on Tuesday.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.220]   Well, this doesn't have the...
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:04.220]   I'm in a tweet.
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:05.220]   There's no...
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:08.100]   We live in a time where there's literally no excuse.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.100]   They're very few.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.860]   If you're a baby, I get it.
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:12.340]   If you're deceased, I get it.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.340]   But you know what happens?
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.340]   If you're a felon, a couple of states, I get it.
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.340]   Okay.
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.340]   But in general...
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.340]   I'll give you an example.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:22.940]   In California, if you read the voters ballot, there's a proposition 34.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:23.940]   Who, 34?
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.860]   It's called death penalty in the ballot.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.020]   And you vote yes or no.
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.740]   Now, what do you think a yes vote does?
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:31.420]   That you're for the death penalty.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:32.420]   No.
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.140]   No, you're not or yes, you're not.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.940]   You're saying you're voting yes to repeal the death penalty, but on the ballot it says
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.380]   proposition 34 death penalty initiative.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.380]   Yes or no?
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.380]   What do you vote?
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:47.180]   So if you wait until you go to the ballot booth to decide what you're going to do, it's
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:48.420]   too late, you screwed up.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.420]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.100]   This is the exact problem I have with all of these.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.420]   Everybody needs to vote initiatives and I love you, Baratundi.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.420]   Please don't be mad at me.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:56.420]   I agree.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.180]   It's screwed up California royally.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.180]   I agree with that.
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:00.180]   Say that again.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:03.220]   A side effect is that as you get uneducated voters out there.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:06.940]   So, by the way, when I say don't vote, I mean don't vote for either of the two major parties.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:07.940]   They're totally...
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:14.020]   Yes, but if no one voted for the two major parties but three people voted, someone would
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.020]   win.
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.020]   And that's not going to happen.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.500]   So, it's still important to vote.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.020]   Even if you live in a non-swing state, you want to keep voting so it doesn't become a
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.020]   swing state because that's annoying.
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.020]   There you go.
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:25.020]   With all these ads and...
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:28.620]   But, because as it comes down to right now, Ohio decides who the President of the United
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:29.620]   States is every single time.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:34.140]   Which is why, if you're not in Ohio, you should vote for some third party, any third
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:37.460]   party because your vote matters thousands of times more.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.460]   You can see this is why I love you.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.780]   Because that is a principled and reasonable and like sensical thing to say.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:47.140]   And I will vote the way I want to, which is probably not the way you would.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:49.420]   But we're participating and that makes a whole ton of sense.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.420]   It's so funny.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:56.180]   If you, libertarian Brian Brushwood, is advocating government by fiat instead of democracy.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.940]   I don't know what that means.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:56:59.940]   It sounds very intelligent.
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:00.940]   I didn't hear that at all.
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.380]   But, what I heard is someone saying participate in the democratic process.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.380]   No.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.380]   Okay.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.620]   Because first of all, we have a problem.
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.220]   The problem is our two party system.
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.100]   That's one party more than the communist had.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.500]   And that didn't work out so well for them.
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.500]   You hate freedom.
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.500]   We now have them in collusion.
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.500]   You hate freedom.
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:16.500]   When they write them.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.900]   The debates together, they decide what isn't as an off the table.
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.900]   Oh, here you go.
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.460]   Here's the headline on the New York Times.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:25.340]   "Democrat sued to extend Florida's voting early."
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:29.540]   So here we are again, back as we were eight years ago.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:31.980]   Well, you know what Florida did?
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:34.180]   They decided they used to have this great system.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:38.980]   Yeah, a lot of states have basically restricted your ability to vote this time around.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:44.420]   And it's mainly because poor working class voters can't make the polls on Tuesday.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.420]   Yeah, they do things.
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.300]   And so by doing so, they misinfer it.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.420]   There's a whole movement called Y Tuesday, which challenges why we even forced this to
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.060]   happen in the Tuesday months.
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:59.900]   If any truly freedom loving entity party person, whatever, once maximum participation,
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:00.900]   makes the system more legitimate.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:05.900]   So if you're fighting to reduce participation, you're on the wrong side of his career.
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.300]   Thanks to electricity.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.300]   Tesla.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.300]   My point is yours sucks.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.740]   So, can I ask you sucks.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:12.740]   Can I ask you sucks.
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:14.740]   I'm going to let you guys take over.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.820]   Go ahead and then come back and do an ad.
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:17.820]   We're going to take over.
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.940]   I'm actually going to make a request that people out there go and not only vote, but
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.620]   also go and donate to the Red Cross or something like that for Hurricane Sandy.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:26.620]   I did $50 iTunes.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:27.620]   Let me just push a button.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.620]   There you go.
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:29.620]   That's the easiest one.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.620]   iTunes is great.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:31.620]   I want to push the button.
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:34.300]   I know they didn't even have to give many money.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.300]   It was great.
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.300]   You gave money.
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:37.300]   They have your money already.
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.300]   They have your money.
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.300]   You know what really works?
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.300]   Apple actually has all your money.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.300]   Yes.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:42.300]   And when you spend it elsewhere, you have a license.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.300]   Exactly.
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.300]   You use the money.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.780]   The money that Apple's holding an escrow in your behalf.
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.780]   Exactly.
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:47.780]   You know they already got it.
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:48.780]   They have all of the money.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:53.780]   Apple, the amount of money that Apple has in the bank is $17.50 for every human being
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.020]   on planet Earth.
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:56.020]   Holy cow.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.460]   Say that one more time.
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:03.500]   So the amount of cash that they have in the bank is $17.50 for every human being on planet
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:04.500]   Earth.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.140]   Which is like five times the wages of a third of the world.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.140]   Interesting.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.140]   I was reading a Horace Didu.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.380]   It's a really great blog.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:10.380]   Oh yes.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.380]   Fantastic.
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.380]   He does the numbers.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.380]   He's all about the numbers.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:19.500]   One of the things he pointed out, and he's looking at the financials, is that Apple spends
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:26.860]   more than three or four times what Google and Facebook spend yearly in...
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:27.860]   It's not R&D.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.980]   It's like just in technical stuff.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.060]   So it's not servers.
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:35.460]   They spend more than twice what Intel spends.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:37.900]   Now Intel's a very capital intensive industry.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:38.900]   They build fabs.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.020]   Apple spent $8 billion last year on infrastructure.
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:45.860]   So his question was, "Well what is Apple doing that they're spending three times with Google
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.180]   and Facebook are spending?
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.500]   Spending twice what Intel is spending on capital expenditures?
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   What are they doing?"
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.500]   They're building a doomsday device clearly.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.500]   They're bringing Steve Jobs and that.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:57.820]   But it's nice to have that can you do the day.
[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:58.820]   What do you think they're doing?
[00:59:58.820 --> 00:59:59.820]   We could have said it.
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.620]   I have an idea of what they're doing to be totally honest, but what do you think they're
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.620]   doing?
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.620]   That's a...
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.060]   Okay, I would love to hear what you think.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:10.700]   I got a guess that part of it is network because they need to build their network infrastructure.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.700]   But if they're spending three times with Google and Facebook are spending, it can't be all
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:14.700]   network.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.700]   Some of it has to be fabs.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:20.340]   I think that they're very focused lately on doing their own chips.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.580]   Look at the A6X.
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:26.380]   I think they see that as a differentiator from companies that are using more generic
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.540]   arm chips.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.740]   But then maybe the building in Koopertino?
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:31.740]   I don't know about ARMY.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:38.020]   So, one of the things that Apple does is they take the technologies they develop in one
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.140]   thing and they apply them to everything else.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.540]   So the iPad, they wanted to be really thin.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:47.900]   So the iPhone was touched and then they applied that to the iPad and then they applied it
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:48.820]   to your touchpad.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:55.260]   The iPad was really thin and then they applied that to the Mac, the MacBook Air, the Mac
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.580]   Book Air was applied to the iPad.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.540]   It goes across everything, right?
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.940]   So the building, the things they're doing in that building will be applied to the devices
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.940]   we own.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.860]   And I believe that one of the things that they will be doing in the next few years, I
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.340]   don't know what the timeframe is wearable computing.
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.340]   And I think that that's the next iteration.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.340]   Oh, that makes sense.
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.340]   I think you're right.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.340]   I think you're right.
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.340]   You should for a lot of you.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.580]   You know, Ryan, why can't we all be thin and revolutionary?
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.740]   We could all be walking around with Apple logos on our bodies.
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.180]   Ryan blocks made a very interesting point.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.980]   You know, they pulled the Nano, which everybody's making a watch out of that one.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.580]   They made it some big clunky thing.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:33.380]   And Ryan of GDGT of gadgets said, you know, it doesn't mean they're getting out of wearables.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.380]   They're means what they're doing.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.260]   They're pulling back and they're going to get into a big time and they don't want you
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.940]   to use a phony wearable when they can make it real wear.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:43.020]   And the first thing that they're going to do is the thing that actually, you know, the
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.700]   best, one of the best wearable computing companies in the world is today.
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.700]   Nike.
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:51.060]   Nike plus the Nike plus on your wrist and I can't.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.060]   In your shoe.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.060]   They're killing it.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.540]   And they're tied in very closely.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.900]   And I think and Google's trying to do it and they have glass and they are also working
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.900]   on other things, which I won't talk about here.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.580]   So the blog post in Amazon got that wearable Kindle.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.500]   You can strap to your face with duct tape.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.500]   Amazing.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.500]   It's amazing.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.700]   It's really changes how I read the blog post.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:10.700]   Hey, big spender.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.980]   He says he was looking at the asset.
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.660]   See, this is beyond me.
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:17.540]   I'm not an account asset value growth for property plant.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.540]   I'm not an equipment.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.540]   Right.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.540]   And it's.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.540]   Go ahead.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.540]   I'm muttering to myself.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:23.540]   No, I'm impressed.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.540]   PP&E.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.540]   That's exactly right.
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:32.140]   It's eight point two nine five billion dollars, which is a huge amount of money significantly
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.780]   more than these other comparable companies.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.780]   Here's what's exciting.
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:35.780]   Right.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:40.180]   And when you think about this, we don't know what they're going to do, but we know that
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.420]   they're investing in the future.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:44.940]   And when you think about other companies, you think about nations and states like what
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.300]   is the number eight point eight point two.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:52.660]   They're still building a dollar fifteen cents for every human being on the planet.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.060]   They're building people for our day.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:59.180]   They're building better versions of people Amazon, for instance, 487 million million
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.260]   Microsoft five hundred eight three million Google eight hundred million Intel.
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:07.020]   Yeah, well, they build fab chip fabs two point six physical companies still two point six
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:12.620]   compared to eight point three billion dollars, 30% more than Intel three times Google four
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.740]   times Microsoft and Amazon.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.900]   One of the loyalty chips to all in all of this.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:17.900]   I think that's fascinating.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.380]   So I think that what's going to happen is look at the growth.
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.380]   It's going.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.380]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.380]   It's pretty chart.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:27.140]   So if you wanted to go and do some reporting on this, you should look at the building and
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:31.060]   what's happening at the building and you should look at the other devices and you start
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.420]   to look at where they all kind of converge.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.420]   I like that.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.420]   That is wearable computer.
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.420]   I like your.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.940]   I think that's believable, sir.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.620]   And I think that I think that wearable computing is the next iteration of these devices because
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:42.620]   right now, what are they?
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.420]   They're all flat rectangles.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.140]   Yeah, that's not inspiring.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:51.900]   What's fascinating about wearables for me is that right now we look at our devices and
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.540]   wearables look at us.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.540]   Right.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.700]   So that Nike plus on his wrist looks at him.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.980]   It looks at what he's doing and monitors that creepy, Google glass.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.500]   It's totally creepy, but at the same time, it's the same time.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.380]   It's also just yelling at my wrist.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.380]   Look at me.
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.380]   You look at me.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:17.060]   Here's what I like about your suggestion is that it allows as they as I'm not going to
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.060]   say this is their plan before, but it allows Google to do all the public iterations to
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:26.660]   get people comfortable with seeing other people with big clunky goggles on, walking around,
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.660]   looking weird.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:31.860]   And then Apple will come in and win on design and beauty and fashion.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:36.160]   In many ways, they're sort of getting Google to lay the groundwork to allow them to come
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160]   in and swoop in.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.060]   I think I think we just I think we.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.060]   I think he's bored.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.380]   He would activate Delta protocol.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.980]   Leo Laport has left the calm.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.980]   Good.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.900]   I mean, we get to talk politics again.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.580]   We never stopped talking, baby.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.580]   All right.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:54.060]   So here's the question now that now that he's gone, should we hack his Twitter, his Google
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.020]   plus his Facebook what I mean, I think these things have all been done before.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:58.020]   Yes, I know.
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.020]   There's no innovation there.
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.020]   No innovation there.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.020]   All right.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.860]   So what's your dream wearable device?
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:07.900]   I mean, so taking inspiration from minority report.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.900]   I still want that.
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:09.900]   I want the gloves.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:14.740]   I want a broader physical sort of IMAX type interface where I can actually drag and throw
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.740]   and flip and mostly this is interesting.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.940]   I wouldn't have thought of any kind of wearable thing being a home use device.
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.900]   I would to me wearable just means on the go.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.620]   So I wouldn't have even thought about doing that.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:29.580]   So Brian, if you could have if your glasses could be essentially Google glasses with a
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:33.380]   camera built in and they had a screen and a little airpiece and all those things, would
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.380]   you want that?
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.380]   Yeah, totally.
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.780]   Would you wear all the time?
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:37.780]   Oh, now here's here.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.940]   Let me flip it back to you.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.740]   Which would you rather have that or the car or a car that one of the self driving cars
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.180]   that go live in New York City don't need a car.
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.820]   I want a self driving car so I can get drunk while I drive.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:53.020]   But in New York City, imagine a people mover or something designed for an urban environment.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:57.420]   I mean, this is a science fiction author and podcaster magician extraordinaire Andrew
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.420]   Maine.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.900]   He and I get into fights all the time because I'm more and more about himself.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.780]   And already, hard to believe, right?
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.380]   One of the things he says is says technology outpaces legislation.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.380]   Absolutely.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.380]   Everything outpaces legislation.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.380]   I'm going out.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.460]   But that's what I'm going to do that.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.460]   That's what I'm going to do that.
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.460]   I would get fired up.
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:19.220]   I'd be I think of every new law as a barnacle on the ship of America slowing us down.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.780]   And he's like, don't worry about a man.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:23.140]   We're going to have cars that drives themselves.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.940]   And then it won't matter if you're drunk or old or blind or a child.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.940]   You'll have more freedom.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.940]   Baby's driving.
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:32.620]   We were just asking what if you could have one wearable device, what would it be?
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.060]   And I believe you would probably pick glasses so you could look at porn in your glasses
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.060]   while you're sitting.
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.580]   I'm looking at porn right now.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:42.260]   That is so uncomfortable for the guy you're looking at.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:45.780]   He just came to support the show and now you're objectifying him.
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.780]   He's hot.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:47.780]   Hot.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.860]   What would your dream wearable device be?
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:50.860]   Leo, I don't know.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.660]   I never really even thought about wearable devices.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:53.660]   I don't know.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:54.660]   You're watching me, right?
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:57.940]   Well, but it's but it's going to help you because we wander around with our head down
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.180]   and we look at these things and we bump into things.
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.140]   What if that device said, Hey, you know what?
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:05.580]   I know that you're actually in a meeting and so I'm not going to let that text message
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:11.140]   from bar tunde is really not that important to come through right now or maybe your nose
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.140]   the bar.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.140]   This is a great question, Nick.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:16.420]   So, so think about the flip side just on the audio side of things like right now, if
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.260]   you want to talk to Siri, you have to pull out your phone, you have to press a button
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.060]   and then she starts to sing and you say what you want.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:26.900]   What would you be comfortable with your phone constantly listening to you, always knowing
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:31.500]   the context of what you're up to and so that you could say, Hey, Siri, make that happen
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.260]   and then boom, like an assistant, like a guy.
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.820]   So, so she was able to do that in some ways.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.820]   Yes.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:41.660]   And when you think I was talking to my friend Ron, Ron J Williams, we talked a lot about
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:46.100]   these tech theories and what's missing and we talked about the calendar a lot and the
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.940]   phone knows all these things already.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:48.940]   Just as an act on them.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:52.900]   If I've got a meeting 30 minutes from here, correct, and I have it moved from my current
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.300]   location and it starts and 30.
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.060]   It should be like, Yo, dude, you're running late.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.060]   Google now already does it.
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.060]   Oh, Google now does it.
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:00.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.060]   So where's Apple?
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.060]   You have to have that.
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:03.060]   In fact, Google is doing a lot of these things.
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:07.060]   For instance, most of the Google dictation, you can say hello and it will say yes.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.060]   It's listening.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:11.180]   So with the Google now watches where you go.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:14.980]   And for instance, it told me this morning, if you don't want to be late for your Pilates
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.380]   class, you should leave now.
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.380]   So that's wild.
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:18.380]   We got to switch.
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:21.180]   I got to switch back to Google now is get an, but get it.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.180]   I don't trust Android.
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.180]   You know, get a jelly.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.180]   I have the jelly one.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.820]   Can I run it on the Nexus one?
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:27.820]   No.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:28.820]   Next is one.
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:29.820]   HTC.
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:30.820]   No.
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:31.820]   Next is you.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:32.820]   Next is one.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:33.820]   We know some people will take care of you.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:34.820]   We'll take.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.900]   Leo's going to get you a phone right now.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:41.740]   In the chat room, somebody points out that as far as an always on listening digital assistant,
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:44.460]   he said that he would be this is your own nerd in the chat.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:46.580]   This is an HTC.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:47.580]   What is that?
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:48.580]   What is this Brian?
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:49.580]   Do you know?
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:50.580]   I don't know.
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.580]   It's like a phone.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.580]   It looks like a phone.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:53.580]   Brian brush.
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.580]   Brian.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:55.580]   I'm a German ex-sourer.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:00.660]   The first day in the chat room suggested that he said he would be okay with it always
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:05.900]   on and always listening if it was linked tethered to his physical computer at home, but he's
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:09.300]   way uncomfortable with it being in the cloud with somebody else.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:13.340]   So there was an MIT professor that did this experiment where he put cameras throughout
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:18.140]   his entire house and documented everything and it was they were he was trying to learn
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.180]   how his child learned as they as they grew up as children.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:24.380]   And one of the things that they did that was really interesting was they later added
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:28.100]   the ability to be able to go back and say, hey, that thing that happened 20 minutes ago
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.100]   deleted.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:34.540]   And I think that what has to happen is before we get to the point in society where we allow
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:39.020]   these things to monitor us, we have to be able to tell them to un-monitors too.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.900]   And that is the only way it's going to work.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:44.300]   And I don't think it's not in the best interest of companies, but it is in the best interest
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.300]   of companies.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:50.860]   We had a great conversation with Jonathan Schwartz on Wednesday, a former CEO of Sun.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.300]   Very engaged in privacy.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.300]   Yes.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:57.020]   And really actively saying, you know, companies have got to be very clear.
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.020]   Absolutely.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.940]   And right now they're kind of, oh, you don't need to know, you don't need to know what
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.940]   we're doing.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:03.940]   Just trust us.
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:06.580]   And then they need to be even more clear than Google is.
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:09.740]   I think Google has been fairly clear, but they need to be even more clear than Google
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.740]   is.
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:14.220]   But if they are, there are huge values to be gained from stuff like this.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.460]   Now this is the Nexus two.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:16.460]   This is giant giant.
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.460]   That's a tablet.
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.460]   That's a tablet.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.460]   It looks like a big.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.460]   I'm going to give you my galaxy H2H.
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.460]   It looks like a galaxy.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:22.460]   They sold 30 million of these.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.460]   That's a beautiful phone.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:31.100]   This is one of the most successful phones of all time.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.100]   And here's a couple extra batteries.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.300]   Well, I'm not more than you're actually giving him that.
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.300]   Why not?
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.300]   I don't want that.
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:37.300]   Don't give me the tablet.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.300]   I'm good.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.300]   I got it.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.300]   So well to wait.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.500]   It's like talking on an iPad.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.660]   Which is bigger the iPad.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:50.420]   Here's the, when Nick, when you talked about wearables, and you talked about how we walk
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.580]   around holding this object in our hand that's glowing rectangle.
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:54.580]   This is a wearable.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.260]   It's the onion referred to it.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.260]   Great headline.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.660]   One of the perverse benefits of the blackout in lower Manhattan last week is
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:02.660]   going to walk.
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:04.740]   So I went in on various with some friends.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:05.740]   Real life and pins.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:09.060]   And so we were walking around the East Village and it's pitch black and it's commerce by
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:12.740]   Canada light in Chinatown shops and there's people using actual pay phones.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.380]   And you can't use Yelp or Google or four squared to figure out where to eat.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:17.900]   You go by rumor and word of mouth.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:21.020]   I heard there was a place at 10th and a serving burgers.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.020]   We found this place.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.020]   I saw your check.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.020]   It was.
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:27.140]   Well, we saw this place called bad burger and they were as a French woman who's a co-owner
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:32.060]   and she was so happy because she said, listen, people are talking to each other.
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.380]   People are walking around making eye contact again.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:39.180]   And you know, they're thinking about doing like once a month, a no tech night to kind
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.940]   of restore the sense of physical community.
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.140]   I think it's wonderful.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:46.500]   We, we hunker down and we have our earbuds in and we're walking around with a sound that's
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:50.820]   not immediate in a place that's virtual and not present for us.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:54.980]   And we become hyper connected digitally and hyper disconnected in a very physical, hyper
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:55.980]   local sense.
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:00.500]   So you want a more binary existence where you have your plugged in general life, but then
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.940]   from time to time, you declare these as off limits like you.
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:08.980]   You know, Mark bitman, the columnist in the New York Times, he wrote a piece called the
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.580]   digital Sabbath and one day a week that he leaves his device.
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.580]   I know people who do that and I think that's it's pretty great.
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.180]   Do you think people do that really?
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.500]   I mean, I think that devices are going to have to do it.
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.580]   I think, you know, one of the things like you just said, one of the things with these
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:22.820]   devices is they connect us to people that are far away, but they disconnect us from
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:23.820]   the people that were right.
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:28.780]   And I think that eventually the technology has to solve the problems it creates, right?
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:32.900]   So, so for example, mobile phones created a problem where people texted while driving.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:33.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:37.340]   Siri and Google voice and things like that were a solution for that problem, right?
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.340]   That's really nice.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.340]   Right.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:42.220]   And, and I think that technology has a, it's created so many problems.
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.620]   It has so many problems to fix.
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:46.740]   And I think that we're now entering that era where those things will.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:47.740]   That's okay.
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:48.740]   It's all been a new problem.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:49.740]   Totally.
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.740]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.900]   I have to say, I keep in touch with you guys, all three of you, even though you are far
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.780]   away, I'm, I kind of know what you're up to.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:56.900]   I, I saw your check from when you went out to eat.
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:57.900]   I got gouged.
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.740]   It was 20 bucks for a, what was it?
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:02.540]   For penne, the rest of the process.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:03.540]   20 bucks.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:07.580]   They literally boiled water and threw dry goods in it and then charged it was on.
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:08.580]   And it was on.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:09.580]   But cash.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:12.340]   I thought the bottom line was because he wrote Stay Safe at the bottom of it.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.340]   I thought that was the point.
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:15.940]   And it was, it was a, it was a good experience.
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:16.940]   Yeah.
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:17.940]   You know, we, you met people.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.420]   One restaurant I was in, one bar, whenever someone came in, we gave them a round of applause.
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.420]   Oh, that's.
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:23.580]   And we said, whoa, that's so neat.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.700]   And it was a really, you know, there's something sad.
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:26.860]   Every time there's a disaster.
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:27.860]   Disaster.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:28.860]   Forcing every time it's a disaster.
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:29.860]   Beautiful.
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:30.860]   People get that though.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:31.860]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.860]   It's a shame that we have to wait for the disaster.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.060]   No, I got, I have a friend on Rockaway Beach, Bob Hart.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:38.900]   He runs politics for New York one, the premier local news station.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:42.140]   He's lived there 14 years and he's been vlogging every day.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.780]   He's been talking about his, about his experience.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:48.900]   And there's like a Sikh group in Occupy Wall Street who are out organizing the Red Cross
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.700]   down there and he's documented that.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.900]   And that's become a story.
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:54.820]   Like that's only possible because I'm connected to him virtually.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:55.820]   Absolutely.
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:56.820]   And physically get there.
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:57.820]   Absolutely.
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:58.820]   That's a beautiful episode.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:13:59.820]   I understand.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.820]   That's my point is that I keep in touch with you guys.
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:01.820]   I feel like you're friends because I see what's going on.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:02.820]   I'm not trying to read.
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:03.820]   I know.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.820]   I'm trying to read.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:05.820]   Well, I know.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:11.260]   There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a whole generation of kids who are growing up
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.500]   in a world where they're not gonna have old friends,
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.100]   they're only gonna have this increasingly giant hoard
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.200]   of everyone they've ever met,
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.700]   and they still keep in touch with.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.800]   - And that's also a problem.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.280]   That's a huge problem.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.460]   There is no worries in the friends,
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.320]   - I decided to describe what I told you.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.400]   - The technology, we're at a point where technology
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.780]   has to start solving some the problems that create.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.600]   - I agree.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.020]   - It has to start defriending people for me.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:31.860]   That's what it says.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.040]   - You brought this up at the very beginning,
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.380]   Twitter self-hield.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.540]   - Yeah.
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:36.380]   - It'll work.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:37.200]   - It'll work.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.040]   - It'll work.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:38.980]   - That'll work.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:39.820]   - Let's take a break,
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:40.660]   'cause I wanna show you how to get stamps.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.500]   - Oh, great.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.320]   I like real stuff.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.160]   - It's funny, actually.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.660]   - Actually, Leo, Leo, this is not even a joke.
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:45.500]   This is not a setup.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.660]   This is not anything I planned,
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:48.420]   and it'll sound like this is a plug.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.300]   It's not meant to be a plug.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:53.320]   I am freaking out, because as you know,
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.620]   my wife is pregnant and we're due to have a baby
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:58.660]   on December 24th on Christmas Eve.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.500]   - Awesome.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.660]   - And in an effort to get paternity leave,
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.860]   I set up this thing at scamstuff.com.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:05.660]   It's an indie go-go project with,
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:08.020]   I'm trying to sell people some scam stuff.
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:08.980]   Like people always say,
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.300]   where do I get this for scam school?
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:11.420]   Where do I get that for scam school?
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.980]   The idea is, I gotta be at home anyway.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.500]   I can't be on the road touring,
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.660]   so I'm gonna set up a little boutique,
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.660]   kind of a woot.com for con artists.
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.940]   - And you're doing great, by the way, 24 grand.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.820]   - Yeah, unfortunately, here's the problem.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.620]   Yesterday, and this is not even a lie.
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:29.980]   I started freaking out because I saw how expensive it is.
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.900]   We didn't factor shipping into any of this.
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:32.900]   (laughing)
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:34.780]   We're gonna be doing fulfillment,
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.260]   and I was like, I was like,
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.940]   wound up tight, totally losing my crap.
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:42.540]   And then I remembered, and this is not even a joke,
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:46.700]   stamps.com, I go on, and it mentions that you get,
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:50.340]   well, like 20% off your postage for freight.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.540]   You get discounts on the priority,
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.260]   and I know all this because I was researching it yesterday.
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:56.860]   - If you do enough mailing, it actually,
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.580]   it costs you nothing.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.220]   And you may actually be at the level
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.420]   where you're doing so much that you--
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.540]   - I'm on Zen.
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:03.540]   - I don't think I'll get there,
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.500]   but all I know is I need anything
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.820]   that's gonna reduce the expansion.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:09.260]   'Cause we not factor in shipping on this,
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.980]   and I was afraid that bizarrely, perversely,
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.940]   this was gonna end up being a money loser for me.
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:17.220]   So I'm definitely gonna check out stamps.com.
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.740]   So I wanna hear this offer, go.
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.740]   - So, well, first of all, go to scam stuff.
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.660]   - Scamstuff.com.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.020]   - That's not like a healthy domain name.
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.260]   - See all the stuff that you can buy.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.860]   Like, why is it called Scamstuff?
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:32.420]   - Well, because he has a show called Scam School.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:33.660]   - I hope Scam School, right?
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:35.860]   Scam School's all about what the tricks you do at the bar.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.100]   - It does seem a little awkward.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.500]   - It does seem like, I'm like, oh no,
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.860]   here we go again.
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.460]   - It was originally called virustriplex.org.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.780]   (laughing)
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:45.980]   - I'd like to do that, I will click on.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:47.860]   That'd be my homepage.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.460]   - Well, one of the things you're gonna like about stamps
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.820]   is you will be able to click,
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.500]   this is like professional mailing, right?
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.180]   So you'll be able to click and an email will go out saying,
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.340]   your stuff has been shipped,
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.860]   here's the tracking information.
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.300]   It prints out, it takes,
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.140]   it'll probably work with,
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.380]   I don't know if it'll work with Indiegogo,
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.780]   it works with Etsy, Amazon, eBay, PayPal,
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.500]   probably works with Indiegogo.
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.540]   So you're gonna do fulfillment, you click a button,
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:14.140]   it takes the fulfillment, are they paying with PayPal?
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:16.460]   And that they are?
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.020]   - Yeah, with Indiegogo they could do a PayPal
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.100]   and it goes in there.
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:20.540]   - So it'll take it from PayPal.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.180]   And it prints out a mailing label,
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.740]   so it's all done for you.
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:26.460]   If it's priority mail, express mail, as you said, discounts,
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.940]   if it's international mail, it fills out all the form.
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.380]   It really is kind of the idea is it's,
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.180]   kind of professional shipping for smaller businesses.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.060]   I think this might be a really good--
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.980]   - And by the way, I should point out,
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.540]   people in the chat room are going to scamstuff.com
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.500]   and apparently it's not forwarding
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.420]   to the Indiegogo page for some people.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.340]   It should be indiegogo.com/scamstuff.
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:48.740]   - That works also, yeah. - That works with YouTube.
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:50.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.260]   Yeah, please, indiegogo.com/scamstuff,
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:53.340]   just go directly there.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.420]   But meanwhile, back to stamps.com, so here's the deal.
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.260]   - Yeah, sorry.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:57.580]   - No, no, that's fine, I really wanted the point
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:58.580]   that I'm glad you brought it up.
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.220]   - I'm so excited about these guys.
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.220]   - I bought you some diapers.
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:03.220]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.420]   (laughing)
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.420]   - They're for you or the kid.
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.260]   - Good.
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.580]   (laughing)
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.660]   - Well, I need to know for the size.
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:11.500]   - Yeah.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.020]   (laughing)
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:16.860]   - Stamps.com, when you get there on the upper right,
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.620]   see there's an $80 value, that's good.
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:20.260]   And I'm sure that Brian, you probably thought,
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.340]   well, that sounds good enough for me,
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:22.580]   but click that microphone
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.100]   in the upper right hand corner there
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.020]   and enter our offer code, which is just Twitch.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:27.460]   It's easy to remember, TWIT.
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:29.900]   Each show has its own, so always use the offer code
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:31.180]   for the show you're listening to.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:32.940]   Look at that, $55 in postage.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.660]   Now, that's gonna be over a few months, Brian.
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:36.820]   You can't use that all at once.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:38.140]   But the digital scale is great.
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.780]   I mean, really, you'll get an assembly line
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:40.700]   going with this thing.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.060]   You plop it on the scale, it prints it out.
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.180]   You don't need any special ink,
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.020]   you don't need a postage, you're just--
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.380]   - You're able to label it like,
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:48.980]   because one of the things we're gonna give out
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.100]   copies of my book when it gets printed next quarter,
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.540]   and we could do media mail.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:54.700]   We don't have to go waiting for it.
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:55.540]   - Totally.
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.100]   - Can I ask a question, Brian?
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:57.940]   - No.
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.020]   - How long did it take you to do your hair in the morning?
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:01.340]   - Today's zero minutes.
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.900]   It's surprisingly robust.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:05.420]   - If you go in the back, there's a spike taped to the wall.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:06.260]   - Really?
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.100]   - Yeah, there's a little--
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.100]   - How do you mean zero minutes?
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.140]   What did you just like, wake up,
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.580]   and like a robot has done your hair for you while you're sleeping?
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.500]   - Like maybe when I wake up, you have one straggler
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.340]   in his quarter of the day.
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.740]   - Brian invented wearable hair.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.580]   It's exciting.
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:18.740]   It's a brand new product.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:19.580]   - That's awesome.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.140]   - And you can look forward to an Apple store near you
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:21.980]   sometimes.
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.900]   - That's a stamp.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.220]   - Back to stamps.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.060]   - Back to stamps.
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.260]   - That's it, just go there.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.380]   Do it, it's really great.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:33.220]   - Stamps.com, $110 value, get the scale four week trial,
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:34.660]   but you gotta use the offer code to it.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.460]   And I'm telling you, if you are in a situation
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.740]   where you're doing a lot of mailing,
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:39.140]   it is a lifesaver.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:42.420]   - I will only use it if next time I come on the show,
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:44.180]   Leo does his hair like Brian.
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.540]   - That would be an amazing moment for history,
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:47.380]   for technology.
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:48.220]   - I don't know.
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:49.060]   - I'm sure I'll lower it.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:52.180]   - I will do my hair that way, and Bartunde will watch us.
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:53.820]   - I will definitely take pictures of you guys.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:54.660]   - That'd be fun.
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:55.500]   We could all do our hair that way.
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.340]   - That'd be fun.
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.180]   That'd be fun.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.020]   That's all dude.
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:19:59.020]   - I will need a wig.
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:01.780]   - You just gotta grow it out.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:02.620]   - That's not it.
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:03.580]   - Well, winter is coming.
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.500]   - Grow it out.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.340]   - Did you ever have a grow?
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.180]   - It sounds so ominous.
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.500]   - When you were a college, you were just coming.
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.020]   - You could sound like the worst.
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:11.500]   - I had a 10 inch fro.
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.340]   - Did you really?
[01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.340]   - Huge.
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:14.180]   - Huge.
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:15.220]   - Are there any pictures existing?
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.580]   - Billions.
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:17.420]   - I wanna see some.
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.260]   - On the inner web.
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:19.460]   - Oh yeah, he's just pictures of him.
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.540]   - I had cornrows, big fro, twist.
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:24.260]   Never have full dreadlocks, but yeah.
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:25.420]   I used to change my hair like every week.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.740]   - If I could grow a fro, I would toe it.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:27.580]   - It's a man of mini fro.
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.020]   - It makes your head look big.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:31.020]   - Yeah, it makes your face small.
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.460]   - Oh, that's not good.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.540]   That's when I cut all my hair, my face was huge.
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:35.820]   - Can you have the great hair?
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.180]   - Yeah, can you guys got the super fro?
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.020]   Can you have the cheese?
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:39.740]   - Yeah, that's actually, if I could not even
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:41.780]   bear a ton day afro, will I find it?
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.740]   I don't know what you've learned.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:45.460]   - If you go to Baratunde, you might not wanna do that.
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:46.820]   (laughing)
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:47.660]   - What is that?
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:48.660]   - All right, this is bad.
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:49.580]   - I'll do the images.
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:50.980]   I'll do the image search here.
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.740]   - No live Baratunde, that's part of the reason
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:55.020]   that the ridiculous guile hairstyle was,
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.820]   so it makes my head a triangle to make my chin.
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:57.660]   - Oh, is that you?
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.940]   - Yeah. - That's so fat.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.740]   - That is me, even the little polyester suit.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.340]   - Oh, wow! - Flaring polys.
[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:05.340]   - Oh, that's so cute!
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:08.620]   - Wow, we're going for the close-up, I see.
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:09.620]   - Yeah, let's zoom in on that.
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.620]   (laughing)
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.460]   - That's great.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:14.020]   - Okay, well, if we found that,
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.900]   we should be able to find an afro here.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.740]   I don't know who that is.
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:18.500]   - I'm looking on, I'm going deep.
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.820]   - Looks like going back.
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.780]   - Yeah, Glenn Beck's crying about Baratunde.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.340]   - I'm going deep. - Going deep.
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.260]   - I'm going deep. - You have like
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:26.140]   special techniques that you can go really deep.
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.180]   - I do have some special techniques.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:28.420]   - Do you ever do this, Baratunde, and go,
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:30.100]   "God, that's history going here."
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:30.940]   - Well, it's just,
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:33.020]   your whole life is flashing before your eyes.
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.540]   - Hey, there I am as Barack Obama.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:35.380]   - Yep.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.220]   - Wow, you look just like it.
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:37.340]   - Oh, this is a good one.
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:38.180]   - There's a good one.
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.020]   - Oh, I got an arse right there.
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:39.860]   - Here it is. - Look at this.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:40.700]   - Here's the afro.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:41.540]   - That's not real.
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:42.380]   (laughing)
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:44.020]   - I got it right here.
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:44.860]   - Let him boom.
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:45.700]   - That's a dumb in the White House.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:46.540]   - That's a dumb in the White House.
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.700]   - No, that's out of the State House,
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.300]   and I lost it.
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:56.300]   - That's, I remember the guy who took that.
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.300]   - That's when you look like the Fresh Pinsabella.
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:00.300]   (laughing)
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:03.300]   - You heard the joke, and this is what I, this is somebody said,
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.300]   when Scott Forstall was fired, they said,
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.300]   "Ah, prepare three envelopes."
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.300]   You've heard that one.
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.300]   - No.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.300]   - A fellow just tired as a CEO at a high tech company,
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:14.300]   the CEO stepping down, met with him privately,
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:16.300]   and gave him three numbered envelopes.
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.300]   He says, "Open these up in order.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.300]   "Just kind of take a downturn."
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:21.300]   And he's getting a lot of heat.
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.300]   He's at Witsen, but he remembers the envelopes,
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.300]   so he goes and he goes to his door and opens the first envelope,
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:28.300]   and the message reads, "Blame your predecessor."
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.300]   Good advice.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.300]   The new CEO calls a press conference,
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:35.300]   tactfully lays the blame at the feet of the previous CEO.
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.300]   Press says, "Okay, Wall Street response, sales pickup,
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.300]   "problems behind him."
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:42.300]   Year later, again, slight dip in sales problems,
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.300]   combined with a serious product issue,
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.300]   maybe an antenna issue, I don't know.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.300]   Maybe maps didn't work, so while having learned from his previous experience
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:51.300]   as CEO, opened the second envelope,
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.300]   the message read, "Reorganize."
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:57.300]   So he did this company rebounds after several consecutive,
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:00.300]   profitable quarters, a company once again falls on difficult times.
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:04.300]   The CEO goes to his office, closes the door, opens the third envelope.
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:07.300]   The message reads, "Prepare three envelopes."
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.300]   - Do you think science works better?
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.300]   - Do you think we're at the second envelope?
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:13.300]   Is that the stage we're at here at Appra?
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.300]   - That's really cool.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.300]   - Envelope number two.
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.300]   Let's see.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.300]   - What's next?
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.300]   - What's their next story?
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.300]   - I'm Google Head and an app that they called off.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.300]   - Go ahead, go ahead, Brian.
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.300]   - Well, we were just talking about Android,
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:30.300]   and I guess this last quarter, Android finally surpassed 75% of the market.
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:31.300]   Is that right?
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.300]   - In that quarter sales.
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.300]   - Yes, and that's important.
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.300]   - That's not cumulative.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.300]   - That's not cumulative.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:39.300]   - On top of that, they hit the same number that Apple touted on number of apps,
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:42.300]   700,000 apps in the Google Store.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:43.300]   - That's right.
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.300]   - That's right.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:45.300]   That's a rough tie.
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:46.300]   Close enough.
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:49.300]   - I think the three envelopes we have a name for the show.
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.300]   - Yes, we do.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:56.300]   - Three envelopes, one with spiky hair, one with an Afro, and one that is...
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.300]   - This is gashing.
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.300]   - This gets the crap out of people and bars.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.300]   - I love it when you guys are all together.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.300]   - So much fun.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:04.300]   - And I thank you for bringing some Prosecco.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.300]   - We really love you to bring whiskey.
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.300]   This time we switched it up.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.300]   - I have whiskey if you want to move on.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.300]   - Do you?
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.300]   - Oh, God, yes.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:15.300]   - I mean, John, would you pick out a fine whiskey or a bourbon?
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.300]   - It's not one for bourbon or whiskey.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.300]   - Bourbon, please, John.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.300]   - A bourbon.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.300]   I thought he was...
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.300]   - You looked like a bourbon man.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.300]   - A bar fighter.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:22.300]   - A lightweight...
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.300]   - But a bourbon.
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.300]   - Wellter.
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.300]   - Wellter.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.300]   - So it's funny.
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:28.300]   So I went to this week.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.800]   I was writing about Apple.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.800]   I was writing about...
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.300]   I had to go to the Windows event and wrote about that.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.800]   - It was an amazing month.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.300]   - And then I went to the Google event.
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.300]   But at the same time...
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.300]   - The Google non-event.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.300]   There was no...
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.300]   - The Google non-event.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:40.300]   We all went to their offices.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.300]   And they showed the things.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:44.300]   And a lot of the reporters there in the bloggers were saying,
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:48.300]   "How do we explain all of these devices to people and tell them what to buy?"
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.300]   And none of us could answer that question.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.300]   - Something has happened.
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.300]   - Everything just looks the same.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.300]   - No, I've been covering this for 30 years.
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.300]   - Yeah, I was about to ask you, like, what is your theory?
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.300]   - And I don't remember ever...
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.300]   - I don't know what's in that bottle, but I don't think anybody should drink that.
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:01.300]   - You should want a cart.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.300]   - My goodness.
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:03.300]   - First of all, I think they like brown leather.
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:04.300]   - Well, that's the white one.
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.300]   - This is king king.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.300]   - Whoa.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.300]   - That's not going to my face.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.300]   - Yeah.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:10.300]   - I like the Woodford Reserve.
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:11.300]   - Love Woodford.
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:12.300]   - That's the one.
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.300]   - I have several bottles of that.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:16.300]   - Do you think that we can somehow figure out how to make my car drive itself back to
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.300]   the city after this?
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:18.300]   - There's an app for that.
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:19.300]   - You can stay up and out for that.
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:20.300]   - It's called Tazs Rapids.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.300]   - It's called Tazs Rapids.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:22.300]   - When are you going to Australia?
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.300]   - Tonight.
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.300]   - Really?
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:25.300]   - Yeah.
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.300]   - You want to just camp out in Petaluma?
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:27.300]   - Yeah, we'll just camp here.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:28.300]   - It's a better Internet.
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.300]   - It's one bed, but it's a big one.
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.300]   - Can you stop and feed my dog on the way to the airport?
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.300]   - A pixel.
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.300]   - A pixel.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:46.300]   - A pixel.
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:47.300]   - Yeah.
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:54.300]   - I'm going to drink it out of a wine glass.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:58.300]   - Tuesday is the Melbourne Cup, which is apparently a big horse race in Australia.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.300]   - How do you know cups are so many things?
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.300]   - And we are arriving.
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.300]   - Look at that.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.300]   - Nipper and his master's voice.
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.300]   How do you like that?
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:07.300]   - That's great.
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:08.300]   - You don't want that one.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:09.300]   - I like that one.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:15.300]   - So we're going to have a meetup at the Hearts Pub, which is at the Rocks in Sydney on that
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.300]   730 PM on Tuesday, Melbourne Cup Day.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.300]   If anybody wants to come by, I'd love to see you.
[01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:20.300]   We're going to have lots of people.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:21.300]   - Excellent.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:22.300]   - Okay, so you've been in this 30 years.
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:23.300]   - 30 years I've been in it.
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.300]   I've never seen anything like this.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:29.300]   And I think what's really changed is these devices now are small enough, popular enough,
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.300]   and affordable enough that they're mass consumer devices.
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:38.300]   So the technology industry had not been until recently creating the number of mass market
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:40.300]   devices that it had in the past.
[01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:44.300]   We've had Big Christmas, you know, the Commodore 64 Christmas, or the Furby Christmas.
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:50.300]   But now everybody wants a smartphone, everybody wants a tablet, everybody's looking at Windows 8,
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.300]   and it is a vast number of products announced.
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:56.300]   I don't remember any year ever anything like this.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:00.300]   - So I have to say, I've always been a totally nerdy gadget guy.
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.300]   I literally just got so excited.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:07.300]   I remember waiting in line six hours for the first iPhone, you know, barely sleeping the
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:11.300]   night before an announcement for like a new video game system, whatever it was.
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:12.300]   And now I just...
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.300]   - It's over well.
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.300]   - Well, that's fatigue.
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:15.300]   - It's fatigue and I don't care.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.300]   - And it's weak.
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:18.300]   - And now they're just the tech journalists.
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.300]   - No, it's not because I would still love the devices.
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:23.300]   I still love the iPhones and all these devices.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:26.780]   And I think what happened this time with the iPhone, it was the first time I didn't go
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:30.300]   wait in line and I waited a week before I got the device.
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:31.300]   - What about you, Schwood?
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:33.300]   - As far as what?
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.300]   - Like how do you still like the model?
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:36.300]   - Do you still care as much?
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:39.300]   - I'm excited that Leo mentioned the Commodore 64 and the Furby.
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:40.300]   - Two devices.
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.300]   - In the same era.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.300]   - In the same era.
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:47.940]   - So you guys still excited about all these devices or do you look at the new Mac, I'm
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:51.020]   back and say, eh, it's just a little thinner.
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:54.100]   - I thought that way for the first time during an iPad announcement.
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:59.740]   I was really annoyed because I bought an iPad three like four months ago and then, and
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:02.940]   now it's like, I feel stupid taking two plugs around.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.740]   It's like, I really felt Apple fatigue at that moment.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:09.100]   Like we talk about cashing in and diminishing your brand.
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:11.300]   Apple has really diminished its brand for me.
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:18.260]   And I'm somebody who is predisposed to want to like shiny objects, but I'm feeling the
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.260]   same thing.
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:22.340]   - I'm actually a little concerned that we're all turning into the Wally world where we're
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:29.500]   just so, it's all about distracting us with the latest gadget, the latest piece of Chrome
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.140]   that they're all disposable.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:35.740]   They're going to fill the landfill and there really isn't any real value or real change.
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:36.740]   - I thought there's a solution.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:40.180]   - What is the solution for the landfills and the environment?
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:45.540]   - The solution is we are going to, as a society, transition to artificial scarcity.
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:49.740]   We are going to start to want objects that are not physical anymore.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:54.380]   We're going to want certain fake objects that are in the MMOs that we play.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:29:00.100]   We're going to want certain exclusive backgrounds or exclusive experiences that happen.
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:01.380]   - Well, exactly.
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:04.300]   It's only going to get better and it's going to be more environmentalist result.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.300]   - Better or worse.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:09.380]   - No, we are built to want new things.
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:10.980]   That's very clear from what we've seen.
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.980]   - That's a biological society.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.980]   - Yeah, that's a biological society.
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:19.700]   We can fight it, which in society, fighting human nature hasn't worked out very well.
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:24.460]   Or we figure out a way to channel it in a way that is helpful, healthy and not detrimental
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:25.460]   to the environment.
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:29.620]   And I think artificial scarcity and artificial objects are going to become the new status
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.620]   symbols.
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.460]   - We should play Diablo 3 all the time.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:38.780]   - So one of the reports that I wrote about a couple weeks ago was interesting, was about
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:42.500]   how long people wait to upgrade their phones and it's slowing.
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.500]   And so in 2007--
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:44.500]   - Oh, that's good news.
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:45.500]   - Look at you getting data.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.500]   - Yeah, in 2007--
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.500]   - Yeah, I can't see many.
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:48.500]   - Because I would have said exactly.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.500]   - Well, actually, PC growth hasn't changed.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:59.180]   It's grown for Apple, but it's flat as far as the entire industry goes.
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:02.500]   The amount of time people wait to buy televisions, all these things have remained the same.
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:07.100]   But what's fascinating is in 2007, Americans upgraded their phone every 18.7 months on
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:08.660]   average, right?
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:13.460]   In 2010, which was the last time this report was done, it was 21.1 months.
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:14.460]   So it has stretched--
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.460]   - Yeah, those are skewed.
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:16.460]   Those are such short--
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:17.460]   - Right.
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.460]   - Because for instance, 2007, maybe they were all buying iPhones.
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:22.300]   - No, but you can see the curve dip.
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.140]   What's fascinating though is if you look at Finland, and this is just one country that
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:26.620]   I noted.
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:30.500]   It was 41.8 months in 2007.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   - Wow.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.500]   - Now it's 74.5 months.
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:34.860]   - Oh, that's crazy talk.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.380]   That's almost-- that's six years.
[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.580]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.580]   But I think that in Europe--
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:39.580]   - That's crazy talk.
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:40.580]   - You look at the numbers--
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:41.580]   - Well, mobile penetration or so much.
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.740]   - You look at the numbers on these-- for a lot of these European carriers, people wait
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.740]   much longer than they do in the US.
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:47.740]   I mean, we are--
[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:53.980]   - So there may be a couple of factors, and one Europe experienced wireless saturation,
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:56.420]   much sooner than we did, so they're for a long time.
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:57.420]   - Absolutely.
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:58.420]   - So that could be the future.
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:30:59.540]   There's the economic situation.
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:05.460]   There's also-- the pricing is very different there in terms of level of subsidy of handsets.
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.300]   That should scale in the same direction though.
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:09.460]   Like, that's a dramatic shift from 40 months to 70 months.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:10.460]   - Yeah.
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:11.460]   - Percentage-wise.
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.260]   - Well, it's also-- it's no key a country, so it's a--
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.180]   - Yeah, so they have a dominance.
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:18.660]   - But if you look at the numbers across the board, there isn't a country where the number
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:19.660]   has actually accelerated.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:20.660]   It's always--
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.140]   - When I know a lot of interesting things are happening in hardware.
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:24.140]   - Yeah.
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:26.660]   - It's not quite a reality.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:29.540]   What does the average contract length in Finland, for instance?
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.540]   Is it the same as two years?
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.540]   - Well, that's the way I'm going to have them here.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.540]   - Contract not even be--
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:33.540]   - Contract not even be--
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:34.540]   - Six years.
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:35.540]   - Six years.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:36.540]   - They should just do that.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:37.540]   - We would like you to buy-- I don't know what the benefit is.
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:38.540]   - We all knew for six years.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.540]   - Yeah, you'd be able to kill those.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:44.620]   - So if you sign that here, you'll be using this Nokia mobile flip-bone for the next
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:45.620]   six years.
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.020]   - I hope you enjoy it.
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.780]   We don't make phones that can last six years.
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:49.780]   That seems impossible.
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:54.780]   - Okay, Brian, Mr. The Environment is perfectly fine on its own.
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:55.780]   - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Tiger?
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:57.780]   - I don't slow down there, spiky.
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.780]   - Spiky versus Tiger.
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:31:59.780]   - Oh, Tiger.
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:00.780]   - Tonight on my turn.
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:01.780]   - Oh, Tiger.
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:04.780]   Watch the prize fights are on.
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:10.620]   - So given that people do upgrade these devices every 21 months in the US, right, and a longer
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:15.420]   period of time overseas, where do they all go when they upgrade and they upgrade and
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:16.420]   they upgrade?
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.420]   - They go to space.
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:19.260]   - What is the environmental cost here?
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:23.860]   - You know what I wish is that there was some place that we could keep all of our goods
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:28.020]   for safekeeping for like a safe amount of time, like some kind of giant vault so that
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:33.420]   when it was economically viable to go back and recycle them, we could do so.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:36.060]   Oh, wait, that exists.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.060]   It's called a landfill.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.300]   And I'm not saying irresponsible dumping.
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.540]   I'm not saying that you should poison the earth.
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:45.500]   I'm saying that there should be responsible management of the disposal of our devices so
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:46.500]   that we could get them back.
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.340]   - Do you know what this sounds like?
[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:51.340]   - Do you think at some point we'll be mining landfills for a threshold?
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:52.340]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:54.340]   100% they're already doing that.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:55.340]   - They're already doing that.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:59.660]   Yeah, and anthropologists go back and they actually, they go back and they dig out giant
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:03.340]   cubes from landfills in the 70s and they're able to see how many condoms there are.
[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:06.580]   - Yeah, but that's a limited, that's a limited, that's not recycling about actual
[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:07.580]   archaeology.
[01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:08.580]   - That's a limited value.
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:12.060]   Hey, we're going to build these landfills so that thousands of historians in the future
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.060]   can see what we can do.
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:17.740]   - What I'm saying is there's already an entire industry there being built in, built on how
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.620]   to take advantage of what's the transfills.
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.140]   And we're seeing outliers right now.
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:22.980]   But look man, humans are smart.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:24.780]   You don't ever bet against humanity.
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:27.420]   They figure out a way to squeeze a profit out of everything.
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:29.180]   - Every once in a while you should bet against humanity.
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:31.980]   We make bad decisions pretty, you don't want to let them out.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   - No, we're not the man.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:33.980]   - There's any percentage of betting against humanity.
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:34.980]   - How do you know that Brian Brushford was a problem?
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:35.980]   - What are you going to collect?
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.980]   - He's not, he's a libertarian.
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:39.300]   - Look dude, I do not call you names.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:40.300]   Don't call me a Republican.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:44.020]   - No, but here's what I love about your proposal Brian.
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:49.900]   You're basically arguing for treating, you know, disposing of your technology like nuclear
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:50.900]   waste.
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:54.100]   You're arguing for a Yuka mountain for your iPhones.
[01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:55.660]   But we're already doing that.
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:34:01.060]   We'll just put these things away and cash them and basically burn, which is really, it's
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.780]   like a debt also if you think about it, like you're saying our grandkids are going to fix
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:08.620]   this because we're not smart enough yet to sort it out.
[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:10.100]   - Well that's true too.
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:12.820]   - That's an interesting burden slash opportunity.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:13.820]   - You bet on the future.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:17.540]   - It's a good take and I'm going to go for that because I built an entire business on
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:20.940]   getting people to buy new crap as much as possible.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:25.060]   So, yeah, I wish we had a gazelle ad here because it's a beauty.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.740]   - That would be so perfect at times.
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:30.180]   - You know what though, I'm big into digital goods.
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:31.180]   That's what you were saying, right?
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:32.180]   - Yeah.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.180]   - Digital goods.
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:34.900]   For instance, audio books.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:35.900]   - Yes, all.
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:38.100]   - There's no cost to the landfill.
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:39.860]   - I love, well there is.
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:42.860]   There isn't that you're supporting a model.
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:43.860]   - Wait, go fair.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:44.860]   - It's indirect.
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:45.860]   - It's indirect.
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:46.860]   - Shut up.
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:48.860]   - Ignat on the ost K.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:50.100]   - No, of course there is.
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:54.460]   But it's, you know, I mean it's a fairly, that's a lightweight cost on that.
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:56.220]   And there's no incremental.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:59.940]   - Given the amount of entertainment you get from a single audiobook, I load it up, you
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:01.740]   know, I'm going to be in a 14 and a half hour flight.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.740]   It's almost paranoid.
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:03.740]   I got like 20 books.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.740]   - So we see you're gonna put my book on there?
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:06.740]   - No.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:07.740]   - Do I read it?
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:08.740]   - How to be black is not on there.
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:09.740]   - I know I read it.
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:10.740]   - And I imagine you.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:11.740]   - When I read it.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:12.740]   - I'm gonna be reading it.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.620]   - You get it from Audible, which is actually, I signed up last time I was on the show and
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:17.620]   I'm still a member.
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:18.620]   - Oh, you have?
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:19.620]   - Yeah, and I signed up with--
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:20.620]   - You ever get time or listen?
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:21.860]   - You know what I go through phases.
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:23.860]   You know what I listened to that was amazing was--
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:26.460]   - How to be black by Beartune Day.
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:27.460]   - How to be black by Beartune Day.
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:28.460]   - No, I listened to--
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:29.460]   - I listened to your book.
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:30.460]   - You did listen to it.
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:31.460]   You like live tweeted it.
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:33.660]   - There was so many good things in it.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:34.660]   I love it.
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:35.660]   - You're amazing.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:36.660]   What can I say?
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:43.660]   - The book that I listened to is Ready Player One.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:44.660]   - Oh, that book is amazing.
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:45.660]   - That book is amazing.
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:46.660]   - That book is amazing.
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:47.660]   - That book is amazing.
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:48.660]   - Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:49.660]   - It's amazing.
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.660]   - I'm gonna listen on the airplane.
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.660]   - I actually, you could tell you're listening to a good book when--
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.660]   - Wait a minute, stop.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:56.660]   It's reading it.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:57.660]   Hold on.
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:35:58.660]   I don't know how to--
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:35:59.660]   - How does this work?
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:00.660]   - That was just one of these devices.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:01.660]   - Really Leo?
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:02.660]   - So I was quite--
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.660]   - I was quite--
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:04.660]   - I was quite--
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:05.660]   - I was literally sitting in my garage in my car listening to the end of the chapter.
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.660]   - I was a host.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.660]   - I just--
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:08.660]   - It's weird about audiobooks.
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:11.660]   They just made me want to sit in my garage in my car.
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:12.660]   - Oh.
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:14.660]   - But don't do that unless you have ventilation.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:15.660]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:16.660]   - It's a door open.
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:17.660]   - Exactly.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.660]   - But no, when you can't leave, that is a great sign.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:20.660]   - No, but it's a great sign.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:21.660]   - I drive around the block a couple extra times.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:22.660]   - I heard that it's gonna be a movie.
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:23.660]   - Oh, I can't wait.
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:24.660]   - It's a fast movie.
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:25.660]   - It's a fast movie.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:26.660]   - And that's so good.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:27.660]   - You know who's gonna play the evil bad guy?
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:28.660]   - Who?
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:29.660]   - I forget his name.
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.660]   - Don't know spoilers 'cause I'm just starting it.
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:35.660]   - Agent Spash, the guy from--
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:36.660]   - I'm a half-hour guy.
[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:37.660]   - My rug.
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:38.660]   My rug.
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:40.660]   The big Lebowski guy.
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:42.660]   - Oh, Jeff Bridges is the bad guy.
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:43.660]   - Oh, Jeff Bridges is the bad guy.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:44.660]   - That works.
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:45.660]   - Oh.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:52.660]   - By the way, this book was written by Ernie Klein, who 12 years ago, or I guess no, 13 years ago,
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:37:00.660]   before either of us were anything, he wrote the script for fanboys that later became a real compromise movie with the Weinstein company.
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:05.660]   He's a slam poet in Austin, and when I heard about the massive success, it's saying once it got put up there,
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:11.660]   he got a $500,000 advance, and then the movie rights auction for $500,000 more, and it could not happen to a nicer guy.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.660]   - Nice.
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.660]   - He is genuinely one of the best people on planet Earth.
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:16.660]   - Yeah, he's so excited that he's been all guys.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.660]   - He's a really good dude here 'cause the book is so--
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:20.660]   - I listened to it on a recommendation from this show, actually.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:21.660]   - Yeah.
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:26.660]   - So Jeff Bridges and then Ellen Page will play the girl who's adorable.
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:27.660]   - Oh, I love her.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:28.660]   - That's perfect.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:29.660]   How old is she?
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:30.660]   - She's 25.
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:31.660]   - She's 25.
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:32.660]   - I like that one.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:33.660]   - We could date.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:34.660]   Is she single?
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:35.660]   - Sorry.
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:36.660]   - I keep going.
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:37.660]   - Turning twins.
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:38.660]   Okay, cute, big.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:39.660]   - I love it.
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:40.660]   - Okay, twins.
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:41.660]   - Okay, twins.
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:42.660]   - So wait a minute.
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:43.660]   - So many--
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:45.660]   - So we've got three books now.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:46.660]   We've got Nick's book.
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.660]   - Ellen, if you're listening, call me.
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:48.660]   (laughter)
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.660]   - I'm glad it's you 'cause usually I'm Mac on the girls, and it's really--
[01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:54.660]   - How does that work out so far?
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:55.660]   - It's not working out so good.
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:58.660]   - And it's really kind of disgusting when an older man like me.
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.660]   - There's a line of creepiness that you cross.
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.660]   - I cross the creepy line about 20 years ago.
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:03.660]   - I think I'm kind of approaching it.
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.660]   - No, you're close.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:05.660]   You're gray.
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:06.660]   - That's not like a gray for like 10 years.
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:08.660]   - Yeah, that gray is not on its own.
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:09.660]   - Yeah, I know that.
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:11.660]   - You know that, but I don't know if the girls know that.
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:13.660]   - Maybe I'll just carry that phone with it.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:16.660]   - She went to the nice to have an Afro.
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:17.660]   (laughter)
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:21.660]   - And so we're talking about audible.com, an amazing sponsor which makes all this quite possible.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:26.660]   - And actually, hey, Baratunde, remember when I got all fired up about single data points to explain statistics?
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:27.660]   - Yeah.
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:28.660]   - Why?
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:29.660]   - Why?
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:30.660]   - Why?
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:31.660]   - Why?
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:33.660]   - Because I'm reading Thinking Fast and Slow by Kahneman.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:34.660]   - That's a big thing.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:38.460]   It's like the human brain is not built to take that big picture.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:39.900]   We see what's right in front of us.
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.660]   We have gut reactions and that's why I got all fired up about that.
[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:43.860]   - Well, that's a great point.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:49.660]   And I think it's adorable that you believe in facts and science as a way to sway people.
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:50.660]   (laughter)
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.660]   So he's all about logos.
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.660]   You're a little bit about pesos.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.660]   - I think it's adorable that you're looking forward to facts.
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.660]   - And this guy's just about hitting on that.
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:58.660]   - You guys want to hear actually a funny nerd?
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:01.660]   - No, 'cause I'm gonna fish this ad and then we'll let you guys.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:03.660]   - Don't walk in the ad and tell us a funny story.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:05.060]   - He didn't even know, this was the beauty of it.
[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:06.700]   He didn't even know we were doing an audible ad.
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.380]   He was just talking about audible.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.380]   And I liked that.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.380]   - Yes, that is big naturally.
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:11.380]   - I did not know.
[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:13.420]   - But I remember that I signed up from the last ad.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:14.420]   - Right.
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:15.420]   You were an audible author.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:16.420]   I live in the future.
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:18.620]   Here's how it works by Nick Bilton.
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.260]   Baratunde is an audible author.
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:21.980]   How to be Black by Baratunde Thurston.
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:22.980]   - Yes sir.
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:23.980]   - Also paperback.
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:24.980]   - Paper Black.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:25.980]   - Paper Black.
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:30.220]   - Get a Kindle, get a paperback, get a hard cover and get audio.
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.540]   In fact Brian, we gotta get scam school on--
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:35.660]   - Yeah, I see, I'm behind the times with you guys.
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:41.780]   I did an ebook first with scam school books one and two, but I'm steps behind.
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:44.900]   I did make it my first publishing deal, signed.
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:46.940]   So that's why we're gonna have scam school in 2013.
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:52.140]   - So you're gonna have to take one of these out because we've got a way to get two books
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:53.140]   and there's three we've got.
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:54.140]   - Ooh, it's in the cage.
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:55.740]   - It's Sophie's choice.
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:56.740]   It's a cage match.
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:57.740]   So here you go.
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:58.740]   - Audible.com/twit2.
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:02.220]   - You're gonna get, signing up for the Platinum account.
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:03.220]   That's two books a month.
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:04.780]   So next month you can get another book.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:08.340]   But if you wanna do it free, first month is free, first two books, first two credits
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:09.340]   are free.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:11.060]   Each of these is one credit.
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:13.660]   And you can cancel any time, pay nothing, keep those books forever.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.180]   And I got one more book for free.
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:19.780]   If you go to audible.com/sanderson, this one is apt.
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:21.140]   This is anybody can get this.
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:22.140]   You should all get it.
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:25.020]   If you're an audible member or not, you don't need a credit card.
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.020]   It's called Legion.
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:27.020]   It's a novella.
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:28.020]   This is interesting.
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.580]   They're just giving it away to anybody who wants.
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:31.580]   And it's really good.
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:32.980]   It's bad a guy.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:36.820]   They call him Legion because he hallucinates all these other characters around him and
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:39.420]   they solve mysteries.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.220]   It's really an interesting book.
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:43.100]   I really like it.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:45.060]   Legion by Brian Sanderson.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.180]   Here's how you get that for free.
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:50.700]   And even if you like are not intrigued by Audible, you don't wanna sign up, whatever.
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:55.700]   Please do me a favor to get this one because you'll love it audible.com/sanderson.
[01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:56.700]   Okay.
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:57.700]   Sanderson.
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:58.700]   S-A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:40:59.700]   And we thank Audible.
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:00.700]   Great.
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:01.700]   Great sponsor.
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.700]   I've been on Audible since before the iTunes integration.
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:06.900]   Did you see that Facebook's gonna give...
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:08.700]   You're gonna be able to buy physical gifts now?
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:10.300]   Yeah, you can buy physical gifts.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.300]   They're kind of...
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:12.300]   But they're bad.
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:13.300]   What are the gifts?
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.260]   There's like friendship bracelets.
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:17.500]   They asked me to buy a Bartone, they have friendship bracelet.
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.340]   They obviously don't know that I already got them on.
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:22.020]   So first of all, I'm disappointed because I have a receipt to get.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:24.500]   Is that the string that you tie around and when it falls off?
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:25.500]   Let's see what the...
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:26.500]   Let's see what the...
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:27.500]   Let's see what the...
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.340]   Let me see if I can buy some.
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:31.340]   Where do I get the...
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:32.340]   Where do I get the...
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:33.340]   What happens is...
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:34.340]   Oh, look at this.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:35.340]   Okay.
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:36.340]   No, I wanna get a gift.
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:37.340]   So where do I go?
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:38.340]   So look for a birthday.
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:39.340]   Birthday.
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:40.340]   So somebody's birthday.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:42.340]   So it's Carrie D. Herrera's birthday.
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:43.340]   I should say buy her a gift.
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:44.340]   This is clearly my cue to go.
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:45.340]   I don't see buy a gift.
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:46.340]   I feel my dream.
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:47.340]   I don't get a buy...
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:48.340]   Maybe you're a special wick.
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:49.340]   Maybe I'm special.
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:50.340]   So I could buy...
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:52.100]   Here, let me plug in the next computer.
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:55.300]   Oh, I don't want people to see my screen.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.020]   You're going to live in a little more life.
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:58.540]   I have a little lesson in your life.
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.740]   I'll tell you.
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:03.580]   So I could buy somebody Stacey a brownie pop bites for $38.
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:04.580]   What is this?
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:05.580]   That's really good.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:06.580]   I love those.
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:08.460]   Amelia's chocolate caramel for $11.
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:09.460]   Right.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.820]   Baggy leather zip clutch for $40.
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:15.540]   Am I really gonna buy someone I don't even know who Stacey is to be quite honest?
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:17.260]   Well, you probably wish to do it for some of you now.
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:18.260]   Stacey, I'm still sorry.
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:19.260]   Here you go.
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:21.620]   So now I just went to a dude, right?
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:26.260]   And it says, "Buy Francois pencils for culture bust for $6.
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:29.380]   I mean, these gifts are ridiculous.
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:31.380]   It could be great if they decided...
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:32.380]   Well, they're plenty of...
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.380]   He needs to be curated over there.
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:34.380]   Somebody stole Spiky.
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:35.380]   He's gone, by the way.
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:36.620]   He's going to get his gift.
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:41.140]   So what could be great is if they mined your data fee, because they do that anyway.
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:42.460]   They look in your underwear drawer, they do all those things.
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:43.460]   They need a tie it to Pinterest.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:44.460]   You can't do your underwear.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:45.460]   You can.
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.460]   But your friends pin and that would be like a registry.
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.060]   And then it could actually work.
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:50.140]   And then it could work.
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:51.460]   But think about it.
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:54.100]   So they have a billion users.
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:57.540]   So if they just did 1% of people, if they could get 1% of their users, I mean, this
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:58.900]   is millions and millions of gifts.
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:42:59.900]   No, this is monetization.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:00.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:04.500]   And this is why all the Facebook employees are selling their stock.
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:05.500]   I know.
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.500]   Because it's gonna be huge.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:08.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:09.500]   That's...
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.500]   So the big...
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:13.580]   Cheryl Sanderson sold a tiny amount.
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:15.260]   Sanderson sold a tiny amount.
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:16.260]   Sanderson's the book.
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.260]   She sold a tiny amount.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:18.260]   She sold a tiny amount.
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.300]   She wanted to go on vacation and buy a new purse.
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:21.300]   I don't know, whatever.
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:25.740]   But the CFO sold half, almost half of a stake.
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:27.740]   47%.
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:33.260]   So the big sell is actually gonna be November 14th when 777 million shares go on sale.
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:34.460]   And they come out of the line.
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:37.460]   So if you're an investor, should that be cost or concern?
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:41.460]   Is it a sign that the people who are like the CFO, who knows better than anybody else,
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:43.060]   how Facebook is going to do?
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:47.540]   I would say if I were an investor at the price that the stock is right now, it's cheap,
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:49.180]   I would buy.
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:51.980]   And I would go long on it.
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.740]   But at the same time, I think that a lot of investors today don't like to do that.
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:57.740]   They don't look...
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.940]   And what I love about Quinn is because I leave because you guys are talking about friendship
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:03.740]   bracelets and I come back and you're already a big pirate.
[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:05.700]   Yeah, you gotta move faster than that, Brian.
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:08.260]   You can't connect it to the matrix, sir.
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:13.020]   I would probably wait till November 14th when the stock goes on sale for the 777 million
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:19.340]   shares go on sale and a lot of people will sell because it's employees that came after
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:20.420]   the first round.
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:23.740]   So the stock will drop more than I would buy then and I would go along with it because
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:27.660]   I think that Facebook is going to be around in 10 years and I think it's going to be essentially
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:28.980]   a blue chip for today.
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:29.980]   So Cheryl Sandberg sold...
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:32.340]   How many do gold business on you?
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:34.340]   I mean, I'd have brought it up.
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:38.620]   She sold seven and a half million dollars worth of shares, but that's just a small amount
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:40.220]   of her overall stock.
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:42.540]   Yeah, that's really nothing when you're saying about it.
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:43.540]   I'm sorry, it was not the CFO.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:44.540]   I'm basically zero-dog.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:46.740]   Like I said, you wanted a new clutch.
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.740]   Yeah.
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:48.740]   Who else?
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:53.540]   Who was it that sold a big chunk of his stocks?
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:56.860]   I can't find it in this story, but nothing to worry about.
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:58.780]   Everything's going to be great.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:01.180]   They're going to sell gifts, friendship bracelets.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:02.740]   That is the business model.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:03.740]   That's the future of Facebook.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:07.340]   You know the thing I do admire about that is that it's not advertising.
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:08.340]   I agree.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.340]   It's a lovely way to figure out.
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:10.340]   It's another way.
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:11.340]   Exactly.
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:15.220]   The dominance of advertising for monetization of the future is a bit much.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.220]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:17.220]   And I think that's exactly.
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:18.380]   They get more creative people.
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:21.260]   How about the Village Voice suing Yelp for the use of Dom?
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:22.260]   Oh, God.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:23.260]   This does.
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:24.260]   This does.
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:25.260]   Really?
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.260]   I want to be the judge.
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:29.820]   That's like Bart and Nate suing anyone that uses the word Bart's name.
[01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:36.260]   Well, this is weird because on the one side, like if you're going to, I mean, which is
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:41.100]   a bigger, more egregious violation, you know, Apple essentially suing over rounded
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:44.380]   corners or the Village Voice suing for best of.
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:45.380]   I don't know.
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:48.740]   Well, Apple because it's a bigger company and I think it stifles innovation, stifling the
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:51.940]   use of the word best of even if they won is not.
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:54.380]   But if they won, that would be a failure of humanity.
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:56.060]   That would be a case to bet against humanity.
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:57.060]   Yes.
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:59.860]   But look at the fact that we have companies like Coca-Cola that have copyrighted the
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:03.140]   color red, you know, I mean, it's like, that's not true.
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:06.100]   There are certain companies that have copyrighted the colors of their logos.
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:07.100]   Yes.
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:08.100]   That was amazing.
[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:10.940]   Like Baratou, they call out Nick and Nick just keeps on going.
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:13.820]   It's just the New York Times and they let them be gone behind.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:17.020]   So I have a question since we're all kind of nerds here.
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.020]   Kind of.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:21.020]   How do we feel about Lucas' art films?
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:22.020]   There you go.
[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:23.020]   There's a story.
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.020]   Nothing but win.
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:26.420]   There's nobody got a son of a.
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:27.420]   Whoa.
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:28.420]   Whoa.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.420]   Whoa.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:30.420]   Whoa.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:31.420]   Just destroyed.
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:32.420]   My heart was broken by George Lucas.
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:33.420]   I was done.
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:38.260]   Like, when they came out with this terrible comedy skit show that's nothing but riffing
[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:41.300]   on the Star Wars movies, I was like, that's it.
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.300]   I'm out.
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:43.300]   Yeah, had a great run, Lucas.
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:44.300]   Yeah.
[01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:45.300]   You're a manless, spiky hair.
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:46.300]   I mean, like, things.
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:47.540]   I'm done.
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:51.500]   And then all of a sudden now people are going to get all bent out of shape saying like,
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:54.300]   oh, I'm not sure about Disney buying everything or whatever.
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:56.060]   Disney did a good job with Marvel, though.
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:57.060]   They didn't they?
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.060]   They did a fantastic job.
[01:46:58.060 --> 01:46:59.060]   It's like you think Avengers was good.
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:02.180]   And now you can have the Hulk body slam Jar Jar Binks.
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:04.100]   It would be a very good moment.
[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:07.740]   So what do you think the next, if we have to predict what is the next Star Wars going
[01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:08.740]   to be?
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:10.820]   Well, I mean, before 2015, they've already said it.
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:11.820]   Christopher Nolan directs.
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:12.820]   Oh, that's good.
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:13.820]   Jeff Darges.
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:14.820]   That's good.
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:15.820]   That's good.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.820]   That's good.
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:17.820]   That's good.
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:18.820]   Dark.
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:19.820]   Yeah.
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:20.820]   Dark, dark.
[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:21.820]   It's going to be.
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:22.820]   That's great.
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:23.820]   It's going to be.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:24.820]   It's going to be like a post-apocalyptic Disney theme park.
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:25.820]   Disney does the road.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:26.820]   It's just like sad children everywhere.
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:27.820]   Have you read the road?
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:28.820]   By the way.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:29.820]   Don't do it.
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:30.820]   Oh, it's the greatest book ever.
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.820]   No, but it will break.
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:32.820]   These are all my favorite writer on planet Earth.
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:33.820]   I listened to that in audio.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:34.820]   It's a great audio book.
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:35.820]   It is.

[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:40.820]   Just search for @nickbuiltin on Twitter and the last one.
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:41.820]   Oh my gosh.

[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:21.820]   Can I share?
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:23.820]   I'll put it in the ad.
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:24.820]   Somebody just tweeted it.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:25.820]   Built it.
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:26.820]   There.
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:27.820]   Look at you.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.820]   Look at that.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:29.820]   That's beautiful.
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:32.820]   You and the girl from -- I feel like you won.
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:34.820]   We look quite nice together.
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:35.820]   We came in here.
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:37.820]   There's definitely no of surgery.
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.820]   What do you think we would call our first child?
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:41.820]   Creepy.
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:42.820]   No.
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:44.820]   That says the creepy guy.
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:45.820]   Creepy doll.
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:47.820]   I think they call it bah to me.
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:49.820]   That was made by Cheetos.
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:50.820]   You made that?
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:51.820]   Cheetos.
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:52.820]   Cheetos.
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:53.820]   Chiarum.
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:54.820]   Well done, Cheetos.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:55.820]   So years ago, so what's the name of the guy?
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:56.820]   Cheetos.
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:57.820]   They named their dog after me.
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:54:58.820]   And that was like --
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:54:59.820]   Somebody named the dog.
[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:00.820]   I don't think that's --
[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:01.820]   I think that's --
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:02.820]   Yeah, that's not as cute as the L.A. page.
[01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:03.820]   Look alike with me and L.A.
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:04.820]   That's not that good.
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:05.820]   You won.
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:06.820]   You won that contest.
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.820]   You know, I watched this --
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:08.820]   Well played.
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:09.820]   There's a really wonderful --
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:10.820]   I'll just say that to my friend Ellen Page.
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:11.820]   Really?
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:12.820]   She thinks about it.
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:13.820]   Tell her that --
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:14.820]   Do you think --
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:15.820]   You know how people go like this?
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:16.820]   They go call me and they put --
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:17.820]   They don't do --
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:18.820]   They're not going to do it anymore.
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:19.820]   You think that the kids today are like --
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:20.820]   Text me.
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:21.820]   No, that definitely happens.
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:22.820]   I was emailing.
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:23.820]   I was texting.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:24.820]   You was texting.
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:25.820]   What do you do?
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:27.820]   You're just running away awkwardly.
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:28.820]   What do you do?
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:29.820]   No, that's pointing at your phone.
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:30.820]   That's like text.
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:31.820]   Check out my new --
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:32.820]   That's like --
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:33.820]   That's like --
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:34.820]   My man first.
[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:36.820]   What is going on here?
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:37.820]   What, Brian, if you wanted somebody to text you --
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:39.820]   One hour, 53 minutes.
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:40.820]   That's what's going on.
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:41.820]   Yeah, no.
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:42.820]   Brian, you wanted someone to text you --
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:44.820]   What was the universal gesture?
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:47.820]   And your tongue had been cut out of your mouth.
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:49.820]   No, they were across the room.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.820]   And you want to just let them know --
[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:52.820]   But you can't speak.
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:53.820]   You don't want to --
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:54.820]   You don't want to --
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:55.820]   You don't want to --
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:56.820]   This is not even a joke.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:59.820]   What I love is grabbing people's attention from across the room.
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:00.820]   Like, I got their attention.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:01.820]   And I'm like --
[01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:02.820]   Like this.
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:03.820]   And then they look up --
[01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:04.820]   Especially if they're in the middle of talking or like a live --
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:05.820]   I'm like this.
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:06.820]   And they go --
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:07.820]   [ Laughter ]
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:09.820]   Just to see this get wrapped up.
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:12.820]   That is not the universal gesture for text, me as a gesture.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:13.820]   What did he do?
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:14.820]   Pretty sure that's not it.
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:15.820]   It's like your number one.
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:16.820]   You described it for our listeners?
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:17.820]   Yes.
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:20.820]   He did something we colloquially call "flipping the bird."
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:21.820]   Oh, oh, schwud.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:22.820]   Yes.
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:23.820]   That was pretty cool.
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:24.820]   No, schwud, seriously.
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:25.820]   How do you do it?
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:26.820]   Like, how would you do it?
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:27.820]   You know what?
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:28.820]   I don't know.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:31.820]   This may be dated, but it's like I'm thinking of Star Trek.
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:33.820]   I'm like, "Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:35.820]   Like I'm holding a Star-Tact file.
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:38.820]   Like I'm holding a Dead Itchin and trying to poke it back to life.
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:40.820]   Why are you holding Dead File?
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:41.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:42.820]   Come on.
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:43.820]   Somebody in the audience.
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:44.820]   What would you do?
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:45.820]   You wanted to say text me.
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:47.820]   Oh, they got it.
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:48.820]   They're good.
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:49.820]   This is it.
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:50.820]   The thumb.
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:51.820]   How do you do that?
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:52.820]   I like Brian's way better.
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:53.820]   It looked more fun.
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:56.820]   But it doesn't hurt me.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:57.820]   This works.
[01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:58.820]   It does work.
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:56:59.820]   What Brian's doing is not talking about that.
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:00.820]   Okay, sorry.
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:01.820]   Sorry, sorry.
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:02.820]   I have another question.
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:03.820]   Hey, Barry, turn day.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.820]   Now that's like your shooting in a video game.
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:07.820]   It's like you intend to harm toward my avatar.
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:08.820]   This is what that says.
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.820]   People are calling it the Dean Stockwell.
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:11.820]   Like from Quantum Leap.
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:12.820]   Like I've got Ziggy.
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:14.820]   Ziggy says you didn't text me.
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:16.820]   We're bringing out Quantum Leap references.
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:17.820]   Quantum or 64.
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:18.820]   I got one more.
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:20.820]   We got to go back to the 90s.
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:21.820]   All right.
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:26.700]   So when you're a kid and your parents said you're like a broken record player, right?
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:28.340]   What will that be replaced by?
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:29.820]   Oh, like what's on the move?
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:30.820]   Like a secret player.
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:32.820]   But no, but CDs don't matter.
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:33.820]   That's still a spinning.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:36.580]   You like you're like a stuck iPod.
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:39.820]   You like you're like a DDoS attack or like I got it.
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:44.660]   You're like a John C. Devorak always saying the same thing over and over again.
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:46.820]   I love how you threw Devorak into the bus.
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:48.820]   You're like a corrupt MP3.
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:49.820]   Corrupt MP3.
[01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:51.820]   You're like dubstep.
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:52.820]   You're like dubstep.
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:53.820]   There you go.
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:54.820]   I love you.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:55.820]   Just add dubstep.
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:58.420]   And think that makes it cool.
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:00.340]   I wanted to campaign ads next cycle.
[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:02.700]   Did you see any of the other shows this weekend to it?
[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:03.700]   I actually missed.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:06.420]   That's good because we prepared something just for you.
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:08.700]   I'm so wish to add to it.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:10.420]   This is to it.
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:11.420]   Know how.
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:12.420]   Oh my God.
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:13.420]   Excuse me, sir.
[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:14.420]   I'm with the mustache, please.
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.420]   I need to have to take this.
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:20.940]   I'm going to have to take this.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:21.940]   Ham Nation.
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:25.380]   Is that a cat costume or is that pepula cue you were?
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:26.380]   He's ham zero.
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:27.380]   Who?
[01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:29.100]   Well, I'm not sure.
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:33.780]   But Julian, I think you've got something on the other side of your face.
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:38.300]   Julian had a little problem with one of our cats, but he'll be okay.
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:39.580]   This week in computer hardware.
[01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:42.140]   So how much kitty hour is it battery life out of it?
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:48.620]   Well, we turned Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off and we played a video on the DVD.
[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:52.460]   No, no, we had it actually it cashed in main system memory.
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:57.580]   And I should be like, let me guess, screen 50% was more like 25%.
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:00.420]   We consider musical and musical office environment.
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:01.420]   Tech news today.
[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:05.700]   No, K'loumae 920 is shipping first two Rogers in Canada.
[01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:06.700]   Wait, wait, wait, come back.
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.260]   It's Canada first.
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:09.260]   Canada.
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:11.260]   Canada is now Canada.
[01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:12.260]   Canada.
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:13.260]   Canada.
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:14.260]   Canada.
[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:15.260]   Canada.
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:16.260]   Canada.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:17.260]   Canada.
[01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:18.260]   Canada.
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:19.260]   Canada.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:20.260]   Canada.
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.260]   Canada.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:22.260]   Canada.
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:23.260]   Canada.
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:24.260]   Canada.
[01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:25.260]   Canada.
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:26.260]   Canada.
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:27.260]   Canada.
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:28.260]   Canada.
[01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:29.260]   Canada.
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:30.260]   Canada.
[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:31.260]   Canada.
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:32.260]   Canada.
[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:33.260]   Canada.
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:34.260]   Canada.
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:35.260]   Canada.
[01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:36.260]   Canada.
[01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:37.260]   That's the quote of the week.
[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:38.260]   Nick Wilk writes in the New York Times.
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:39.260]   Follow him on the bits blog.
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:41.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:43.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:45.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:47.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:49.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:51.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:53.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:54.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:56.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:58.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:58.260 --> 01:59:59.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:00.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:01.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:02.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:03.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:04.260]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:10.260]   No, it's not.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:12.260]   There's an app that helps you out.
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:14.260]   What's interesting is my publisher is Penguin.
[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:16.260]   They were just purchased by Random House.
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:19.260]   I was hoping they were going to call them Random Penguin.
[02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:21.260]   It turns out that's not the name of these things.
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:22.260]   Penguin House.
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:24.260]   I'm actually wondering.
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:27.260]   The problem with this is Twitter is a moving target.
[02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:29.260]   This company has changed a lot.
[02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:32.260]   Yes, but the book is really kind of going to...
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:34.260]   It's really a story of the Valley of the Last Decades.
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.260]   Do you think they'll survive?
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:36.260]   Absolutely.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:37.260]   Without a doubt.
[02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:42.260]   Relevant of any of my skin being in the game because of a book because it's really not because this is more of a history.
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:43.260]   No, no.
[02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:45.260]   I think that in 50 years Twitter will be around.
[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:48.260]   I'm not necessarily sure I could say that about Facebook.
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:49.260]   They're like Ma Bell.
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:50.260]   They...
[02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:51.260]   It's not...
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:55.260]   I'll save this for the next time, but yes, they'll be around.
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:56.260]   Oh, come on.
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:57.260]   Why save any size?
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:00:58.260]   Here's my theory.
[02:00:58.260 --> 02:00:59.260]   You'll have more insights before.
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:00.260]   Here's my theory.
[02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:04.260]   Social media was originally started to say like, I'm eating a hamburger.
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:05.260]   I'm going for a walk.
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:07.260]   That is not what social media is today.
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:10.260]   It is people that are sharing information that they seek.
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:11.260]   It's what's happening.
[02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:12.260]   It's not what are you doing.
[02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:14.260]   It's a digital narrative.
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:15.260]   It's a digital narrative.
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:16.260]   Exactly.
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:20.260]   When you look at the fundamental difference between Facebook and Twitter is on Twitter,
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:22.260]   there is the thing called the humblebrag because people...
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:25.260]   If you say, look, I just got featured in this magazine.
[02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:27.260]   People are like, "Humblebrag, you're a douche."
[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:29.260]   But if you say that on Facebook, it's like, cool.
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:30.260]   Okay.
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:31.260]   That's because Facebook is about you.
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:33.260]   And I believe that we have...
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:37.260]   There is a finite amount of stuff we want to hear about us.
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:39.260]   We want to hear about the world things and the world.
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:41.260]   I know that's Sandy, and that is worth it.
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:42.260]   It's in revolutions.
[02:01:42.260 --> 02:01:43.260]   I love it.
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:44.260]   That's fascinating.
[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:45.260]   Can't wait to read it.
[02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:51.260]   The humblebrag was when you acted like you're like so humbled to be featured on the front page of time.
[02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:53.260]   It's the...
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:02:14.260]   It's the not...
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:15.260]   Absolutely.
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:17.260]   And this is the thing I tweeted about this a while back, and I said,
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:25.260]   "On Facebook, you start out with...
[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:28.260]   You started excited and then you get Facebook fatigue.
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:31.260]   On Twitter, you start out with Twitter fatigue and then you become excited."
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:33.260]   It's actually the big challenge that we come up with.
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:34.260]   It's actually the big challenge that we come up with.
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:35.260]   How do we get people to over that?
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:39.260]   And they've worked with our onboarding process with the recommendations and other things.
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:40.260]   And humping.
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:41.260]   Yeah.
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:42.260]   And humping.
[02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:43.260]   That is Barretunde Thurston.
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:44.260]   Can I miss you?
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:45.260]   Oh, it's good to be humping.
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:46.260]   More often.
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:48.260]   So you're going to want to listen to five or six times.
[02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:51.260]   There's so much good stuff in it that you might have missed.
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:52.260]   I love this cast.
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:55.260]   It is a very deep, rich river of crap.
[02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:58.260]   [laughter]
[02:02:58.260 --> 02:03:02.260]   And you're going to want to listen again and again on the loop.
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:03.260]   How to be black now in paperback?
[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:05.260]   How to be black.me is the website.
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:08.260]   We've got 50% off our hoodies.
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:09.260]   So this is... is this it?
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:10.260]   This is not...
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:11.260]   I love this.
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:12.260]   This is a vote hoodie.
[02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:13.260]   Hoodie vote.
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.260]   This is just encouraging people to vote across all communities.
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:16.260]   They don't have to vote.
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:17.260]   Everybody don't listen to Brian Brushwood.
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:18.260]   He does the matter.
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:20.260]   I don't mean don't vote.
[02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:21.260]   I mean don't vote for the Crips and the Bloods.
[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:22.260]   Yeah.
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:23.260]   Vote for the Crips.
[02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:26.260]   Vote for the Bloods because any other vote is a throwaway vote.
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:29.260]   So if you vote for Roseanne Barr, you're just protesting.
[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:30.260]   No.
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:31.260]   Don't think so.
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:33.260]   Choose a Crip or a Blood, please.
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:35.260]   I don't actually take that position.
[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:36.260]   I don't take that position.
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:37.260]   Just vote.
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:43.260]   So the latest thing I'm working on at CultivatedWid is this your excuse sucks.com.
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:47.260]   Which is about shaming your friends and their terrible excuses and not voting.
[02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:50.260]   And the count of your excuse sucks.com.
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.260]   It'll be super live in a few hours.
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:54.260]   It's not live yet.
[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.260]   It's live.
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.260]   It's temporarily live.
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:57.260]   There's a win to bring it down.
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:03:58.260]   No, you can't bring it down.
[02:03:58.260 --> 02:03:59.260]   I've got some really...
[02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:00.260]   You can't take it.
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:01.260]   We're not quite ready to begin.
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:02.260]   There's not a challenge.
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:03.260]   Like don't try to bring it down.
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:05.260]   But we don't have to put it in this box.
[02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:07.260]   Am I supposed to say why you're excused, sir?
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:08.260]   You're supposed to put your email in there.
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:10.260]   Are you supposed to read the page before asking what's just...
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:11.260]   No, I'm so not into that whole reading page.
[02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:13.260]   What about Mr. New York Times reporter?
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:14.260]   What do I do?
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:16.260]   I don't understand how this works.
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:18.260]   Why do I put my keyboard?
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:19.260]   Why do you have a southern accent?
[02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:20.260]   All of a sudden British man.
[02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:22.260]   He's from Britain.
[02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:23.260]   He's from Brooklyn.
[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:24.260]   He's from Brooklyn.
[02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:25.260]   I don't get it.
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:27.260]   Anyway, great to have you, Berrit.
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:28.260]   Great to be back.
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:29.260]   Always a pleasure.
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:30.260]   Good luck on Tuesday.
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:31.260]   Thank you.
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:32.260]   Where will you be on Tuesday?
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:34.260]   I will actually, because of Sandy, I will be in Brooklyn.
[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:38.260]   For half of the day, I'm flying back to cast my vote because my absentee got washed away.
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:42.260]   And I'll be back in San Francisco Tuesday evening for the national results.
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:46.260]   I have to say, cheers to Bartone for flying back to vote.
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:47.260]   Good for you, man.
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:48.260]   My excuse sucks.
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:50.260]   I mean, it's not very good for the environment, but...
[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:52.260]   I'll toast to you.
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:53.260]   Just count.
[02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:55.260]   It's like, literally, you're going to burn.
[02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:59.260]   Think about your carbon footprint to go cast a vote that's not going to affect the outcome in any way whatsoever.
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:05.260]   Dearest tater, let me explain the ways that I care about democracy in America more than you.
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:06.260]   Are you going to vote, Brian?
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:07.260]   Yeah, I already voted.
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:08.260]   Yeah.
[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:12.260]   I voted, I mean, newsflash, pretty sure Texas is going to go for Romney.
[02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:16.260]   So rather than voting for either of the two big parties, I made a big difference in voting libertarian.
[02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:18.260]   I voted for Gary Johnson and I'm proud.
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:19.260]   There you go.
[02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:20.260]   Good for you, man.
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:25.260]   Did you guys see the graphic on the time site, the 512 space of the White House is beautiful?
[02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:27.260]   It's on the homepage and you can click on it.
[02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:30.260]   By the way, another thing I'll give you a little props to the New York Times.
[02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:31.260]   It's been a big challenge.
[02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:37.260]   I'm sure to go from a print newspaper to a digital newspaper, but they have really embraced digital in a way that I think no one else has done.
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:39.260]   You know what was the telltale sign for me?
[02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:44.260]   It was the fact that I don't have cable TV because I cut my job in the time of the press.
[02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:45.260]   Could you do a modern press?
[02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:49.260]   And I actually watched the debates on the New York Times website.
[02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:50.260]   I watched it on YouTube.
[02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:51.260]   But it's interesting.
[02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:55.260]   You wouldn't think that the New York Times would be the place that you go to watch live television.
[02:05:55.260 --> 02:05:56.260]   They were the stream of record.
[02:05:56.260 --> 02:05:57.260]   They were the stream record.
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:05:58.260]   This is gorgeous.
[02:05:58.260 --> 02:06:01.260]   Nate Silver's doing this?
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:03.260]   No, this is the graphics department that did this and they've been working on this for quite a while.
[02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:04.260]   Wow.
[02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:05.260]   It's a decision tree.
[02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:06.260]   So you can click on, so if you say...
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:07.260]   We're looking at ways to win.
[02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:11.260]   If Obama was Florida, then he wins Ohio.
[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:12.260]   That's a win.
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:13.260]   Then he wins.
[02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:15.260]   Then if you go to the right and you say...
[02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:20.260]   If Romney, if Obama wins Ohio, then in North Carolina he wins.
[02:06:20.260 --> 02:06:22.260]   But there's not a lot of paths for Romney.
[02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:23.260]   So there's...
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.260]   So if Obama has...
[02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:27.260]   Ohio and North Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin.
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:33.260]   Obama has 431 ways to win and Romney has 76 in his five-pimed-type.
[02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:34.260]   This has nothing to do with...
[02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:35.260]   That's exactly.
[02:06:35.260 --> 02:06:37.260]   It's just the electoral college.
[02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:38.260]   Correct.
[02:06:38.260 --> 02:06:39.260]   But it's showing the...
[02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:40.260]   Wow, it's interesting.
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:41.260]   It's also based...
[02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:43.260]   The assumption is taking the current poll.
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:48.260]   So if you go to the top, you can click on, like you can say, Republican, Republican, Republican
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:49.260]   for all these states.
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:50.260]   That's very interesting.
[02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:53.260]   And really it comes down to, as it always does, Ohio and Florida.
[02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:57.260]   Isn't that weird that they basically, for the last few elections, have determined...
[02:06:57.260 --> 02:06:58.260]   Decided who are...
[02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:01.260]   As goes Ohio, so goes the nation.
[02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:02.260]   Yeah.
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:07.260]   Brian Brushwood has having a baby.
[02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:08.260]   That's exciting.
[02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:12.260]   As we refer to it, untitled Brushwood Project, do the plates, December.
[02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:14.260]   Sounds like a Kickstarter.
[02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:16.260]   It's Indiegogo.
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:18.260]   Indiegogo.com/scam...
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:19.260]   What is it?
[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:20.260]   Scamstuff.
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:21.260]   Scamstuff.
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:24.260]   And did you notice what the $10,000 donation was at home?
[02:07:24.260 --> 02:07:25.260]   I did.
[02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:26.260]   I thought that was hysterical.
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:28.260]   I think we talked about it on one of the shows.
[02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:29.260]   There it is, right there.
[02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:30.260]   Name the new Brushwood Kid.
[02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:32.260]   You can give a middle name to my kid.
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:33.260]   No.
[02:07:33.260 --> 02:07:34.260]   You're like, yeah.
[02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:35.260]   Baritone day.
[02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:36.260]   Baritone day.
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:38.260]   I love to brand your child.
[02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:41.260]   Bonnie Baritone day, Brushwood.
[02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:42.260]   Wow.
[02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:43.260]   But...
[02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:48.260]   In all seriousness, one of the things I'm doing is I'm trying to book as many live stage shows
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:50.260]   up until the 24th so I can take paternity leave.
[02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:54.260]   So we actually have like half-price stage shows on that Indiegogo if you guys check it out.
[02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:58.420]   And his, by the way, have a corporate party like a Christmas deal then, you know, now's
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:07:59.420]   the time to book.
[02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:00.740]   I learned a lot from Brian.
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:05.100]   I saw him do a show in New York at a university up in the Bronx and I hadn't seen, I've heard
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:06.100]   him through Twit.
[02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:09.700]   We talked and argued on like three different podcasts for the past three years.
[02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:10.700]   His show is amazing.
[02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:16.180]   So if you have a shot to see Brian Brushwood live, do his native thing with the fire and
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:19.780]   the jokes and the tech, he's like the future of magic in so many ways.
[02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:20.780]   So go see him.
[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:25.460]   Wow, dude, that's going straight on my website now, the future of magic by Maritou today.
[02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:26.940]   Happy to endorse you, man.
[02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:28.100]   Really good stuff.
[02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:29.100]   That's awesome, man.
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:30.100]   Thanks.
[02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:31.100]   What a great panel.
[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:33.860]   I am the past of podcasting and I'm glad you're still here.
[02:08:33.860 --> 02:08:37.860]   I'm going now and I always show you the best.
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:40.580]   And everybody in the studio, you all get books that only with our show.
[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:41.580]   Don't leave without your book.
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:43.140]   I have some really bad news, guys.
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:45.980]   I've heard Ellen, that's for the other team.
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:47.480]   Oh, man.
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:49.300]   That's why you were so cute together.
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:50.300]   I always thought you were gay too.
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:51.300]   Because it was mission impossible.
[02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:53.300]   So I thought it was together.
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:57.380]   It's here I was going out with a good, with a nice positive shot and then Leo just, you
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:58.380]   know.
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:00.380]   That wasn't a negative.
[02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:01.380]   And now he's hugging me.
[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:03.580]   That was just my way of saying.
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:04.580]   He's looking through his porn goggles, actually.
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:06.580]   Would you like to go to Australia?
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:08.580]   I don't go that direction.
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:09.580]   You don't go down under?
[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:10.580]   Oh, that is such a wrap, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:11.580]   It's like three wraps and one.
[02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:22.780]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think it would be a prudent time to wrap up the show.
[02:09:22.780 --> 02:09:24.100]   But I thank you all for being here.
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:28.300]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:31.780]   Now because of the time change, we're going, we went off summer time.
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:33.420]   So we are actually now on standard time.
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:36.020]   And that means UTC, which does not change.
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:40.660]   But our time UTC has changed to 2300 UTC.
[02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:42.180]   I think we add eight now.
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:44.260]   2100, I'm sorry, 2100 UTC.
[02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:46.580]   Some number and the letters you get to figure it out.
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:50.140]   You're looking at me like I might know and I don't.
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:51.300]   Chad Johnson's our producer.
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:52.300]   He knows it all.
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:53.300]   2300 UTC?
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:54.300]   OK, thank you.
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:55.300]   Plus eight.
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:56.300]   So that'd be 2100.
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:57.300]   3 p.m. Pacific.
[02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:58.300]   Plus eight is 2100.
[02:09:58.300 --> 02:09:59.300]   But you're saying 2300.
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:01.660]   Everybody's saying 2300.
[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.780]   That's why it's confusing.
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:04.780]   And the funny thing is--
[02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:06.260]   We need like, star date.
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:07.740]   Nobody lives on UTC time.
[02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:08.740]   Captain's log.
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:09.740]   It's just a star date.
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:10.740]   We need that.
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:11.740]   Never mind.
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:12.740]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:13.740]   Thank you for having us.
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:14.740]   You can't say great.
[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:16.740]   It is really my favorite.
[02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:19.740]   One of my-- I can't say my favorite because I have other favorites.
[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:20.740]   But this is really one of my favorite.
[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:21.740]   You can say your favorite.
[02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:22.740]   It is my favorite.
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:23.740]   All of them.
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:24.740]   And you can say your favorite score.
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:25.740]   You guys are rocking.
[02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:26.740]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:27.740]   We'll see you next time.
[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:28.740]   Another twist.
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:30.740]   And don't forget to vote is in the can.
[02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:31.740]   Or don't.
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:32.740]   Damn it!
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:33.740]   You hate her?
[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:34.740]   Wow.
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:37.740]   That was the four musketeers.
[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:44.740]   Really great way to end it.
[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:50.740]   [music]
