[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.000]   Meta losing more value.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.200]   It's the biggest stock wipeout in history this week.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.440]   They say it's Apple's fault, is it?
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.400]   We'll talk about Google breaking 200 billion in annual revenue for the first time.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.160]   Silicon Valley and the Mafia.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.560]   Self-driving software that runs stop signs.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.120]   And North Korea hacked him so he took down their internet.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.120]   All that and more.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.720]   Coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.800]   Tech news and I've got a good panel as always to join us.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.680]   Nicholas De Leon is here.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.000]   De Leon, I always say it wrong.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's De Leon actually.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   De Leon.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So the third time's the charm.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Hi, Nicholas.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.680]   Senior reporter for Electronics Reporter for Consumer Reports.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.120]   Always a pleasure to have you on.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120]   De Leon.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   De Leon.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.880]   You say it properly.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.040]   I should just say that.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.120]   It's a real struggle.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.400]   You know, when I was a kid, you know, De Leon, it's pronounced De Leon.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.520]   I think folks can handle three syllables to be honest with you.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   I think we can do it.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.520]   I think we can do it.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   We'll do it.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.520]   We'll do it.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.880]   Curtis Sohn is also here.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.480]   He is Dan Paterson is here.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.680]   Technology reporter CBS News.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.640]   Dan, it's always good to see you.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   Welcome.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   You too.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   Yep.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.560]   You'll see him on the streaming service of CBS News, which is bigger, brighter, and
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560]   better than ever.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.800]   A lot of effort being put into that right now.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.520]   Also speaking of new publications, Owen Thomas is back.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.720]   He's at Protocol celebrating two years.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.640]   And it's still free.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.240]   No paywall.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.160]   You're still happy with that.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.680]   Yeah, we've talked about paid products on the road, but still seems like it really
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   is right now for that.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   That's a great resource.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.880]   I use it all the time.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.880]   Thank you.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.880]   We quote you all the time.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.560]   In fact, we're going to quote you about meta in just three seconds.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.280]   I, you know, there's so many places we could begin here.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.680]   I could continue with the Joe Rogan saga, which gets wilder and wilder as we go.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   But I think we should talk about meta.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.400]   The company formerly known as Facebook, which suffered the biggest stock market loss, biggest
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.560]   wipeout as Bloomberg put it in history this week.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.880]   Shares went down 26%, which is a $251 billion change in value.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.160]   I want them though, be clear.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.560]   And I'd love to hear what you all think about this.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   This didn't come out of Mark Zuckerberg's pocket.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.920]   This is not, they don't have a bill for $251 billion they have to pay.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.640]   This is the stock market valuing the company.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.320]   You know, it's shareholders, I guess, who will lose money, not, you know, to the extent
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.720]   that Mark's a shareholder, I guess that means his stock is worth less.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.880]   And I think some of this is because analysts had, you know, were disappointed, which seems
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.800]   like a terrible reason to take value off the company.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:27.120]   Oh, and do you think Facebook meta is worth less in reality or just on the stock market?
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.200]   I mean, what is real Leo?
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.680]   You know, NFTs, baby, that's what's real.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.440]   I mean, what's the difference between a share of stock and an NFT?
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.400]   It's all like a belief.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   It's a good price.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   It's fiat currency.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.280]   So a share is a theoretical claim on the future earnings of the company.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.640]   So I think what people were scared about here was not the present, you know, how Facebook
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.480]   is doing, you know, meta, how meta is doing as a company right now.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.680]   But the future, the fact that users of the Facebook app, you know, the blue app actually
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   dropped.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.080]   First time, right.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.640]   And also usage, you know, I think the, you know, the death spiral is not just people
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.560]   like quitting the service or not, you know, Facebook not replacing users.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   It's losing fast enough.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.840]   It's, you know, it's usage.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.520]   And I think that's, I think Facebook is really scared of TikTok as they should be.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.800]   I mean, this should have been in the stock all along because we know young people don't
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.280]   really use Facebook.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.880]   It's their parents social network.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.080]   They use TikTok or Snap or something else.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.720]   And then maybe they use Instagram, which is Facebook's, you know, holding action against
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.640]   the youth.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.840]   Facebook took, I think Facebook actually did a really interesting thing.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.600]   They took advantage of this moment to blame Apple.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.520]   They, they, they said, it's Apple's fault.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.640]   We lost $10 billion because of the checkbox in, you know, that you now get on iPhones where
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.040]   it says you want to let this company track you.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.800]   I don't think they can actually demonstrably prove that that was where the loss was.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.760]   In fact, the $10.2 billion loss came from the reality labs.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:23.600]   It's VR efforts, which have been very, very expensive with, of course, very little revenue.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.400]   Well, those are all of those are.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400]   Go ahead.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   Go ahead.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   There's, you know, there's the hard cost of investing in AR and VR.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.680]   And then I think the 10, the other $10 billion, I mean, and, you know, 10 billion here, 10
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.000]   billion there pretty soon you're talking about real money.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.960]   The other $10 billion was missed revenue.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   Right.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.040]   Like revenue that they could have gotten but didn't get.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   Right.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.880]   So I think that there actually are like two separate chunks and like you add that up, that's
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.560]   a $20 billion delta.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.120]   Am I crazy though, Dan, to say that Facebook would like you to blame Apple, but in fact,
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.680]   Facebook, what really doesn't, Facebook doesn't want you to know is they have perfectly good
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.400]   other means of tracking you.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.360]   They don't need Apple's ID for advertisers and turning that off is actually meaningless
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.480]   from their point of view, but they would like to pretend, it seems to me that that's, oh,
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.480]   it's killing me.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.480]   It's killing me.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.600]   Well, I don't mean this in the, in the cultural sense, but I think all of these issues are
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.760]   real, substantial and intersectional.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:33.560]   I talk to people at Facebook who genuinely think that the, and they will stay off record.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.560]   They genuinely think that the changes in iOS 14.5 and 15 did kneecap them or at least in
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.520]   the very short term, but I think that the larger picture is certainly this drop in usage,
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.600]   which they have tried to duck into this or roll into this pivot to VR.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.760]   So all of those things intersect with each other and all of them as the end result, not
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:04.000]   just result in losing money, but a loss of influence because that's really what money
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   is, right?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   It's influence power.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:20.200]   The daily active users went from 1.93 billion to 1.9 to 9 billion.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.400]   Now admittedly, what is that?
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.000]   That's a lot of millions.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.360]   That's like a million.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:35.640]   But when you have 1.9 billion, I think it's almost a rounding error.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.440]   Should we, Nicholas, what do you think?
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   Is it over?
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.520]   Should we just throw in the towel?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   Should Facebook go home?
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.160]   I don't know if Facebook should come back.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.640]   I had this conversation with, with my bosses and my friends all the time.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.080]   Like have we reached peak tech?
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.600]   I do wonder about Gen Z.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.560]   Are they so, do they even remember a time before technology?
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.560]   Are they over this stuff?
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.560]   Do they not care?
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.640]   Is it not cool anymore?
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.920]   If you're a parent and you're thinking of sending your kids to college, do you want
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.160]   them to pursue a career in tech?
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.360]   Have we reached peak tech?
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.600]   I don't know.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.840]   I was recently in Puerto Rico for a family thing, and I would say just seeing, hey,
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.320]   I have friends and family down there.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.640]   Facebook, meaning the big blue app, is still heavily used.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.640]   And?
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.640]   Certainly.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.640]   What's app, right?
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.640]   What's app?
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.160]   It's funny when I probably sent like five iMessages in my life, actually.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.600]   I'm on WhatsApp all day talking to my family.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.240]   So I kind of have a slightly different perspective on like the messaging wars, I guess.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.640]   But yeah, I don't know if, if, I don't know people just over tech.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   I don't know.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.560]   Especially in the past two years of looking into Zoom calls and all this stuff where
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.160]   people just burnt out.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.160]   I don't know.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.640]   I think it's a very interesting question.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.160]   I obviously don't know the answer.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.480]   But yeah, I guess we'll see, you know, I guess Zuck is trying to pivot to the metaverse,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.080]   which I don't know how that will go.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.600]   I suppose I'm more inclined to be cool with that as a, as a, as a big gamer and as a
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   huge nerd.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   It's like, that's neat to me.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.720]   But like, is my adopted mom going to sit there with a VR headset?
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.200]   All, no, she's not.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.920]   That's never going to happen.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   So I don't know.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.880]   Very interesting series of events here.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.880]   I think you're right.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.920]   I think the stock market anyway says we're at Peak Tech and that's over and we got to
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.920]   find something else.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:30.160]   I should point out though, if you bought into Facebook when it IPO'd, you're far from underwater.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:38.360]   You've still made more than 250 bucks share since the IPO as my wife keeps telling me.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.560]   So I, it's not, it's not the end of the world for Facebook.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.800]   And I often wonder when you see these kinds of drops, Apple lost almost $200 billion in
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.280]   2020.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.560]   And by the way, that would have been a good time to buy some Apple stock because not only
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.880]   the recover, it kept on growing.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.560]   I often wonder, you know, Monday is the stock market going to say, okay, we had our sell
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   off.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.080]   Let's, let's, let's back to business as usual.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.320]   So that's the real question for me.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.040]   I don't care about the stock market so much, but the real question for me is, is this a
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.480]   bell whether is it the beginning of the end for Facebook is Facebook going the way of
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.440]   my space?
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.760]   Are they going to be able to make a pivot to augmented reality?
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.320]   Clearly Zuckerberg feels like he's, he actually had an all hands the day after the stock tumble.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.080]   He, his eyes were red and watery, but he told everybody it was because of a scratched
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:34.920]   cornea, according to Bloomberg, who had unnamed persons at the event.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:41.320]   He apparently, you know, repeated what he'd already said to in the, in the earnings call
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:50.680]   that it was the rise of TikTok, unprecedented level of competition is the phrase reels competing
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.120]   with Instagram.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:13:01.320]   But he also said, I want you all to focus on video, that this is the future.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   And I guess, does he mean video as in VR?
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.640]   Turned out great last time.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   I mean, they're, their home grown video platform was a terrible flop, right?
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.840]   And not just Facebook, but for media companies as well.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.520]   Microsoft flopped with, with mixer.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.360]   Facebook spent a lot of money to bring creators over.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.840]   That didn't go anywhere.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.280]   Well, Facebook also, I mean, the last time they did a pivot to video, they, they, they
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:37.120]   a couple of maybe 18, 36 months afterwards, they said, oops, we, we did a miscalculation,
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.480]   which caused companies like Mike to just vanish overnight.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   Yep.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:47.960]   I guess that's one issue with this is, it could be that the tremors will be felt throughout
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.840]   the tech market, as you say, Nicholas, because Facebook is so kind of pivotal to, for news
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:00.880]   organizations, for, for everybody in driving traffic that failed Facebook might be bad
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   in general for the tech industry.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.960]   So maybe that, maybe that's what we're seeing.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.200]   I find it hard to write them off at this point.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.680]   Well, they're a platform, like unlike my space.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.120]   I mean, those, the comparisons to a previous era of tech are just not.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.120]   That's true.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.120]   It's not my space.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   That's a really, really good point.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:28.100]   Well, anyway, there's the, there's the meta, the meta story, such as it is.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.880]   It's a great number though, 251 billion dollars in value.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.280]   That does hurt in a couple of ways.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.240]   It makes it harder to attract talent because of course you pay them in stock options.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.320]   So it hurts in that way.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.560]   Might be, make it harder to raise money if they needed to.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:47.240]   So there, it's not, it's not a neutral event for, from their point of view at meta.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.960]   And it's a bad headline.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.640]   But I don't think it means that they're necessary.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:57.160]   I mean, 1.9 billion daily active users.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.280]   That's pretty successful.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.400]   You know, one point about attracting talent, they have had problems attracting engineering
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   talent.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.240]   And in the valley, their reputation is pretty bad, at least when it comes to engineering
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   talent.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.040]   But on the other side, although we talk about all the losses, the 10 billion dollars in
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.920]   the, the, their meta component, they've attracted a ton of people.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.520]   From Microsoft, a ton.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.720]   And the HoloLens people are pretty pissed off right now because they kill HoloLens 3.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.600]   So they've done a very good job of attracting talent, experienced talent when it comes to
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.160]   AR, VR and XR.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.360]   I, I have to think though that, you know, part of the problem here is like Mark Zuckerberg
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.880]   is saying, Hey, we're not the Facebook company anymore.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   We're meta.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.920]   AR and VR is where it's at.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:52.640]   So if you're working at meta on the Facebook app, you've got to feel like you're a second
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.800]   class citizen, right?
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.240]   Like you're not taking.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.920]   Seriously, even though you bring in all the money and that's got to hurt morale.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.480]   Like how are they going to hire, you know, engineers to, to work on, you know, fixing
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.800]   misinformation or optimizing ads or, you know, dealing with the Apple, you know, the Apple
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   ID issue.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.400]   That's, that's where I think they're going to feel the pinch.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.600]   Although remember Apple is paying $180,000 bonuses to its engineers, not to go to Facebook.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.120]   So is a cutthroat competition at Silicon Valley for engineering talent?
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.320]   If you're good, you, you know, you can write your own ticket.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.360]   So all of these companies are trying to keep people, not just, not just Facebook.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.280]   And I don't think Facebook's the only company losing talent either.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.680]   I think people just move around to kind of increase their value.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.920]   Alexis O'Haney and I don't know if he's the expert on this.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:48.280]   These of VC now did found, co-found Reddit said, oh, we all know this is going to happen.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:54.480]   He told Bloomberg Facebook ad products just doesn't cut the mustard anymore.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:00.040]   The savviest marketers have started ditching Facebook for advertising.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   That might be the case.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.520]   I don't think it has to do with Apple to be honest with you.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:10.520]   I think Facebook has plenty of ways of knowing who's watching what on their platform.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.080]   But is it the case, do you think that advertisers are turning their back on Facebook that it's
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.320]   no longer the place to go?
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.960]   That would surprise me.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.760]   What do you think, Nicholas?
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:27.480]   I, well, one thing I will say is that the, I never get better ads than I get on Instagram.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.040]   My interests are pretty explicit.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   It's a soccer.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   I said this is part of soccer.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.240]   They do game stuff, watches.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.040]   Those are pretty much my three things.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.400]   And every ad on Instagram is related to one of those three things.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.560]   And I've definitely purchased several items off Instagram.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.240]   So I don't know how they do it.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.040]   I have a mixture of like, don't follow me, don't track ad blocker.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.160]   I try to put up a fight, I guess.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.680]   And yet the ads on Instagram are pretty good.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.560]   So I don't know if marketers, I don't know.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   They seem to be having a pretty good time.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.040]   At least that's not to abandon either Facebook or Instagram.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.800]   You know, look, we sell ads.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.560]   That's how we make a living.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.240]   And I'm constantly worried about Facebook and Google just eating up the ad space and now
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.000]   Amazon because they have so much more information about the audience.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.640]   We don't know anything about the audience.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.480]   And I don't think Facebook's knowledge has gotten any worse thanks to Apple.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.920]   I think that's a little bit of misdirection.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:30.560]   I think where it hurts Facebook from what I understand is tracking a purchase.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:36.240]   So you get to know this great Instagram ad and it pushes you off to a website.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:43.320]   And Facebook no longer can tell if you are, you know, if you actually like click buy.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.680]   You don't think so?
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:52.080]   Remember Google was telling advertisers, oh, by the way, we can tell how many you sold
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.000]   because we got the credit card data as well.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.960]   All of this stuff is sold to data brokers and sold on, isn't it?
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.480]   Don't they know everything anyway?
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.840]   Do you really think Facebook is in the dark about what you did?
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:09.760]   Facebook's payments features have been, you know, like they've always had trouble getting
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.640]   those kind of universally accepted.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.960]   You know, I still don't see a lot of like, even though in theory you can use your Facebook
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.120]   account, I think to buy on some stores, I didn't see a lot of merchants actually adopting
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.120]   that.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   But I don't think you have to.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.720]   I think that if you use a just use a credit card, that information will filter back to
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   Facebook.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.360]   The merchant can link it up, but just Facebook now.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.720]   And if there's a like button or a Facebook bug of any kind under those pages, they know
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.280]   that you went there.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.360]   I think Facebook.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.040]   But a mobile, that's a desktop feature, right?
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.960]   So a mobile, all those links get broken and that's where Facebook's vulnerable.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.560]   Do they?
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.640]   The idea of the only thing that button on Apple does, by the way, is turn off the ID
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.360]   for advertisers.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:02.800]   So that that information, that unique code is not transmitted, but doesn't mean that Facebook
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.520]   doesn't see like buttons.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.280]   Is that stopped by a Safari?
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.360]   I know I use Firefox and it stops them.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.720]   I don't know, does Safari stop them?
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.080]   Safari has a private-ish feature.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.080]   Like a feature.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.080]   Is that private?
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   I don't know.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.080]   Ish.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.720]   I don't think that's that private.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.400]   But I think these days fingerprinting is so good.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.040]   I don't know.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.960]   It's a safe assumption that what you're doing is pretty well known by everybody on the web,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.120]   whether or not you click that button on the IDFA.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.040]   In fact, there's been a number of research studies that back that up over the last six
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.200]   months.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.600]   So yeah, if you're running an ad blocker, but I don't think most people run ad blockers
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   yet.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.600]   I don't know.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.600]   I think this is interesting.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   We'll see.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.680]   Is it the beginning of the end for big tech?
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.200]   Now, government is making some inroads.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.520]   Congress is moving pretty quickly on a number of fronts.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:11.320]   They came out and went out of committee.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.880]   I'm blanking out Congress.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.880]   That's good.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   That's a good thing.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.200]   I can't remember her name.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   Our senator from Minnesota, her bill, Amy Klobuchar, thank you.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:30.840]   Her bill to, and I think it was Marsha Blackburn was a co-sponsor to force a, by the way, the
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.520]   bill was written with like a paragraph per company.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.240]   It was very clear who they were aiming at Google Apple to force these third party app
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.200]   stores.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.920]   And I think that may well pass a, both Senate and the House and go on to be law.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:56.800]   There's also a very concerning bill that is back the Earnet Act, which is a terrifying
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:04.760]   bill, which was, we beat once last summer, but Senator Dick Blumenthal and Lindsey Graham
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.920]   have reintroduced the bill.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:14.600]   It beats it actually in 2020 that will, according to the EFF, pave the way for a massive new
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:21.480]   surveillance system run by private companies just in time.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.720]   It would roll back some of the most, this is EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.280]   Apple, by the way, agrees.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:33.240]   It would roll back some of the most important privacy and security features in technology.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:39.000]   The framework for private actors to scan every message sent online.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.360]   And the premise, of course, think of the children, the premise is, of course, that we've got
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.800]   to stop a CSAM, child sexual abuse material.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:55.160]   And so companies need to be held responsible for every bit of traffic on their network.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.440]   The Earnet Act could also ensure that anything hosted online backups, websites, cloud photos
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.440]   is scanned.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.880]   The fight over Apple's scanning stuff on your iPhone will get ready.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.320]   It also weakens encryption.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.360]   And here's a scary thing about the Earnet Act.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.160]   It has strong bipartisan support.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.480]   This act matches an act, a similar law that is in front of the House right now.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:26.160]   The bill creates a 19-person federal commission, what could possibly go wrong, which is mostly
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:32.520]   run by law enforcement agencies, which will lay out voluntary best practices for attacking
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.000]   the problem of online child abuse.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.960]   The real concern for a lot of people is this will actually just force child abuse underground
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.560]   where it will continue unabated, meanwhile, leaving us in a much less secure and private
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.760]   state.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:56.800]   So just to be aware of CSAM, it also changes Section 230, which is a big issue.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.560]   In fact, Masnek, who's a big 230 supporter on Techdert, had a number of pieces, I think,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.360]   three, talking about the dangers of the Earnet Act.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.920]   Any thoughts, Dan Patterson, on Earnet?
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.640]   I think any time we talk about changing 230--
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.640]   It's bad.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.800]   I mean, yeah.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:32.840]   I can't tell you my opinions on policy, but I think weakening encryption changing 230
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.320]   bad.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   Mike's headline in Techdert is, "How the Earnet Act is Significantly more dangerous than
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:47.840]   Fosta, Fosta, which did pass," he says, "Ern, it repeats the basics of the Fosta playbook,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.760]   but--" and this is very important, "Since Ern, it appears to have significant momentum
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:57.880]   in Congress, it's significantly more dangerous in multiple different ways that haven't necessarily
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.120]   been highlighted."
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.600]   I will say, we can't lobby Facebook, we can't lobby Google, we can't lobby the government.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.480]   So if we find these policies, noxious, lobby the government.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   Or vote.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.560]   Or vote, or both.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.560]   Or both.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.560]   Actually, both might sound pretty good right about now.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.800]   All right.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.320]   I do find it, interestingly, that all of these laws, not just Earnet, but there's another
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.000]   one about ending platform monopolies.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.840]   Yeah, that's the most sure bill, yeah.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.800]   They have these really arbitrary cutoffs.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.040]   If you exceed $600 billion in market cap, then we're going to take away your section
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   to be--
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.600]   Oh, it's totally end of big tech, yeah.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   Right.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.800]   Well, Facebook almost slipped below that.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.640]   So are they on a Monday?
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.640]   Are they going to be exempt from it?
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   Oh.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.640]   And on Tuesday, are they going to be subject to--
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.640]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.400]   Have they thought about how any of this works?
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.080]   Oh, that's really interesting.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   No.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.440]   And another one was $600 billion in revenue, or $600 billion in market cap.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.640]   And I'm like, you at Congress don't understand the relationship between revenue and market
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.640]   cap.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.640]   Do you?
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640]   No.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.880]   It said even more?
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.680]   Even Walmart doesn't have $600 billion in revenue.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.400]   So it would apply to literally no one.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:30.240]   I mean, these things do get worked out through the amendment process.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.640]   And the most glaring kind of oopsies tend to get fixed.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:43.200]   But I still think it's worth pointing out that's a big tell to me that there's not sophisticated
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.520]   thinking about market structure going into these laws.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.920]   And that's disturbing.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:57.040]   Facebook is on the order of $100 billion a year revenue, something like that.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.880]   Profit's pretty good, though, by the way.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.880]   Don't worry about Facebook.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.760]   Their profit is still in the $30 billion a quarter range.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.760]   It's doing all right.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:11.600]   A lot of the alphabet quarterly results came out as well.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.720]   And alphabet broke $200 billion in annual revenue for the first time.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:23.760]   So they did alphabet did not take this opportunity to blame Apple for anything missed opportunity
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.320]   there.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:34.560]   For 2021, the full year 41% year over year jump in revenue for alphabet, unbelievable.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.680]   Fourth quarter revenue, 75.3 billion.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:43.360]   That's up 32% year over year.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:50.120]   Advertising revenue for the quarter, 61.25 billion.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.600]   Apparently, you know, Apple didn't hurt him.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.280]   I think Google and I think Facebook is the same boat have plenty of ways to get information
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   about you.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   Google.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   They have Android.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   Yeah, they have Android.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.080]   They have Chrome, which is the dominant browser.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.200]   They have, you know, YouTube and they have search.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.320]   So you're sending them plenty of signals.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:21.320]   YouTube adds 8.63 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.960]   Of course, there's always the other bets, which always is always fun.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:33.280]   Google makes so much money in search and then they spend it all on Waymo and Verily.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:41.320]   Other bets, 181 million revenue, but I think a substantial loss cloud loss of 890 million.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.880]   So, these are, I'm sorry.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.880]   It's boring, isn't it?
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   Who cares about money?
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.120]   I don't care about money.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   It's boring.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   I care about money.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   You know, money is awesome.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   I'm team money.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:02.120]   I'll tell you, this is something, it's money related.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.880]   It came from Google's quarterly results, but their Pixel phones had their best sales
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.200]   quarter ever, which probably isn't saying that much given that they've not been huge
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.920]   sellers in general.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.080]   Sundar Pichai and the earnings call said in Q4, we said, "At all time, quarterly sales
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:25.120]   record in spite of an extremely challenging supply chain environment."
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.800]   I just got, speaking of supply chain, I ordered when the Pixel 6 came out, I ordered a Pixel
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:37.840]   6, I got that pretty quickly, I ordered the case, which I just got yesterday, four months
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.240]   after I ordered it, but I got it, thank God I didn't drop the phone in between now and
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   then.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.640]   I think it's the first Google phone just anecdotally that I see in the wild routine line.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.800]   Do you see a lot of Pixel 6s?
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:56.200]   I don't know about a lot, but I think on a weekly basis, which I can't recall on any
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.920]   other Pixel phones.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.520]   They don't break out sales figures, so we just have to go by Pichai's claim that it's
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:09.840]   the largest yet, but double nothing is still nothing.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.360]   It doesn't compare with the iPhone or Samsung's phones at all.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.480]   All right, let me take a break.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.360]   I'm going to find something that's going to get you excited.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.600]   We could talk about Joe Rogan.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   How about that?
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   I got to find something.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   Good to help you.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   That's money.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   No, it's not.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   It's not money.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   Well, it is, isn't it?
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.600]   It's $100 million.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:32.600]   I just wanted to add on the point of Google making money handover fist.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.320]   About a decade ago, I had some free Google host.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.840]   I own my own domain, deleone.org, spelled phonetically, and I had it hooked up to Google
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   for Enterprise.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.240]   I got one free email address hosted by Gmail, basically.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.800]   I'm so excited to see you.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   Why are you more?
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.800]   Yes, exactly.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   I got an email two weeks ago saying, "Oh, remember that free single email address we
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   gave you a decade ago?"
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.320]   Now we're going to charge you.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.880]   It's $7 a month for email.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.360]   I'm like, "A, don't you make enough money, Google?"
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.000]   And B, the only thing that that email did, I'm obviously not paying $7 a month for email.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   I'm like George Costanza.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   I was like, "You're not winning."
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.920]   All I did was maybe figure out an alternative hosting arrangement.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.800]   I think I'm going to go with iCloud or whatever, because I already paid for that.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:22.880]   The greed of how many people could have had that free, is it a million, almost certainly
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.880]   not?
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.480]   And you need an additional $7 a pop for the...
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:33.640]   It was very disappointing, and it made me really question, "What else don't I need from
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.080]   Google or from Amazon or from many of these guys?"
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.240]   Just to make an extra couple of months, I'm just re-evaluating my entire relationship with
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   all these guys.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.320]   That's how I work, I guess.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   No, I understand.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.000]   I did the same thing.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.720]   One more thing that Google's switching off.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.640]   So you had the one free email as well?
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:03.080]   No, I was paying for Google services and got a very similar email saying they were raising
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.840]   the price on it.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.680]   And I mean, this was 2018.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:11.320]   I did a story on it, just the process of quitting Google, how I quit Google services.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:19.160]   It took my entire Thanksgiving week to put in, prioritize what Google services are important.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.000]   Oh, geez, there's all these photos backed up, and then to export everything, to kill
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.240]   everything, and I still have nagging Google services following me around.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.560]   So it is a process.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.200]   But I did just put everything on iCloud and Cloudflare.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.440]   Anyway, Nick, the exact same mindset and process.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.440]   Yeah, I clowed that.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.440]   This is not the...
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.720]   I want to point out, Dan.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   This is not your first rodeo.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.280]   It's not the first time you've tried to quit Google.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280]   This is 2019.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.720]   No, that's sort of 2019.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.720]   That's a newer post of the same old story.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.720]   Oh, okay.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   I mean, I've tried...
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.840]   I nuked Facebook services and to do a story on Oculus, I had to start a Facebook account.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.760]   I mean, it is incredibly hard.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.000]   If you want to quit big tech, it's really hard.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.760]   Sorry, Nick, I didn't mean to hijack your own.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.120]   It just sort of triggered my consumer reports finding the best deal.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.400]   I hope we talk about the Amazon Prime increase maybe later in show.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.400]   Because that is similar thing.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.160]   I'm like, "Where's my money going?
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.320]   What's the most of my paying for?
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.360]   How do I min-max to put in like World of Warcraft terms?"
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.360]   Exactly.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.160]   Yes, thank you.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.800]   So it's not money that's the problem.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.520]   It just has to be the right topic of money.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.320]   And we're going to get right down to it.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.920]   Min-maxing your investment in Amazon Prime.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.320]   Ooh, we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   We got a good panel.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.320]   It's going to be fun.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.440]   Dan Patterson's here from CBS.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.440]   Just CBS, CBS News, right?
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   CBS News.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.440]   CBSNews.com/live.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.280]   Got to get the slash...
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.960]   What happens if I don't do the slash live?
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   The old stuff?
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.480]   He's still getting news.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   Yeah, he's still getting news.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.960]   And there's a button on there that says live, so you can go live.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.960]   He can do that too.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   Okay.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.960]   CBS News.com/live.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:09.080]   He's great to see you.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.840]   Also with us, Owen, Thomas, great to have you from Protocol.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.080]   He's a senior editor over there.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.400]   Long friend, longtime friend.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.920]   And always great to have you on.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:25.560]   Kind of relatively new to the group, Nicholas de Leon, who's been on many times now.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.960]   You're no longer the newbie.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   But it's great to have you.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960]   That's okay.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.400]   I'm a electronics reporter for Consumer Reports.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.520]   Speaking of old times, I remember when Linode first started...
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.520]   Gosh, when was that?
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.920]   In the early 2000s.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.560]   It was so cool.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:48.520]   They were one of the first cloud infrastructure companies to offer SSDs, running Linux.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.520]   Man, it was awesome.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.840]   Well, Linode is all grown up, man, and it is awesome.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:59.560]   It's the industry's best price to performance value for all compute instances.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:05.640]   Whenever you're doing shared, dedicated, high memory, doing artificial intelligence,
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:14.720]   GPUs too, you get free DDoS protection, free cloud firewall, unfiltered API access and more.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:21.200]   From Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E, the original, they started three years before AWS.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.680]   And they're still famous for predictable flat fee pricing, universal across all 11 of their
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.680]   data centers.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.320]   There's no weird tiering, no weird regions.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.800]   You just choose Linode because it's the best.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:38.760]   You can't support better than any because the people who work at Linode are like us.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.320]   They understand.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.600]   They're there to help.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.560]   The interaction's always great.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.520]   People choose Linode who want a better customer support experience because they're independent
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:55.400]   and their mission is keep the customer happy.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.640]   No matter what tier, no matter what level, no matter how much they spend, you are not
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.800]   a number to them.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.320]   You are the reason they're there, the driving force behind everything they do.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.840]   Their pricing is transparent.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   It's predictable.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.520]   It's pay as you go.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.040]   They really started predictable flat pricing for cloud computing.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.000]   And there's still the leader in this, no more anxiety over hidden costs, weird egress
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.520]   fees, things like that.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.800]   They make it simple to launch and scale in the cloud with Linode.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.640]   Your flat pricing is the same across every global data center.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.320]   You get an incredible cloud manager.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.400]   It's very easy to use.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:37.080]   There's a full-featured API, great documentation, award-winning support.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   And it's secure.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   It's proven.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   It's reliable.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.080]   It's enterprise-grade infrastructure.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:45.000]   I think that's the one thing, because I've been on Linode so long.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.720]   It's not a hobbyist thing.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:52.480]   It is for me because I use it for projects and practicing coding, things like that.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.240]   But it is enterprise-grade infrastructure.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:37:01.200]   And so many people use it to run their apps, to run their sites for backup, for CI/CD,
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.840]   for AI, for gaming services.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.920]   Their peering relationships are extensive.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.360]   They've been in this business a long time.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.600]   They peer with everyone.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.760]   Their next generation network gives you the modern infrastructure and performance you
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.080]   need to innovate at scale.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.400]   You could choose shared or dedicated compute instances.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.760]   We're going to give you a $100 credit.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760]   You can use it on that.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.960]   You can use it on S3 compatible object storage.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.880]   Yes, that's nice because your S3 software will work with it.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.600]   You already know how it works.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   Managed Kubernetes.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.480]   Yes, they've got that.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.920]   Virtual machines as much power as you need or not.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.240]   Linode was rated easiest to use by G2 Crowd in 2021.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.520]   That's why cloud developers choose Linode because they make managing complex cloud infrastructure
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.720]   easy.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:52.000]   Simple bundled pricing, full featured API, 100% human support.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.760]   They've been doing this for a long time since 2003.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.600]   They've got the longevity you know.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   They know it.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.880]   They've been in this business a long time.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.080]   No hidden fees, scale up or down without penalty.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:13.040]   And right now, get a $100 credit when you go to linode.com/twit, l-i-n-o-d-e.com/twit.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.560]   I'm a big fan using them for years.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   So, let's go to linode.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.560]   Give it a try.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.760]   And we thank them so much for supporting this weekend tech.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.920]   You support us do when you use that address linode.com/twit.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.840]   So, what about Amazon Prime?
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.600]   What about Amazon Prime?
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.160]   $20 bump, right?
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.960]   In yearly fee.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:43.560]   And it kind of makes me mad because they say, "Well, we got to pass along costs."
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.480]   And it's like, "Wait a minute.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   What am I?
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.240]   What exactly am I paying for?
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.760]   Is it Prime video?
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.080]   Is that why Amazon Prime's going up?
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.440]   Is it your rocket to the moon, Jeff?
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:01.040]   Is it your new yacht that they're going to dismantle a bridge in Holland for?
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.240]   What exactly am I paying for?
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:10.720]   I think the mistake of going up by that much, $140 a year, is that it does make people think
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.360]   about it and say, "Is it worth what I'm getting?
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.080]   What did you decide, Nicholas?"
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.080]   Well, I spent several hours, I guess the day after that was announced, researching, you
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.560]   know, give these sentiment online.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.920]   What are people feeling about this?
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.480]   Maybe or maybe not, we will do a story on reevaluating your relationships to all these
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   companies.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.160]   But I think the thing it triggered in people, like I said earlier, was that it just kind
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.280]   of like, "What am I paying for?
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:42.600]   You know, $20 a year is less than $2 a month, which I'll say two things about because that's
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.880]   all it'll come about this too.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.880]   Oh, it's only $2.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.880]   Okay.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.880]   Well, A, that's not the point.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.080]   And B, you know, this is something that's drilled into me from being consumer reports.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.920]   It's like, people have budgets.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.200]   Money does not grow on trees, whether it's $2 or $2,000.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.760]   People have money allocated that they spend every month.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:03.280]   And if you'd ask all of a sudden, "Well, here's an extra $2 a month," okay, yeah, maybe
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.760]   most people can swing that.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.640]   But it's, but maybe they can't.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   So that's one thing.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.280]   And then when they try to justify it by saying, "Oh, well, we have the NFL on Thursdays."
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.600]   I don't know if there's a thing on this plane and I care less about the NFL.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.960]   I don't want to help pay for the NFL.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.960]   I don't care.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.200]   If the NFL disappears tomorrow, I'll be like, "What are you even talking about?"
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.440]   So that, and I suspect a lot of nerds are the same way.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.840]   This is not relevant to me and the slightest.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:34.200]   Now, I will say at the end of all of that, I kind of, I did run the numbers and what services
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:39.280]   am I paying for, Spotify and Cobas and Google One storage, I did all the math.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.600]   And it, as it turns out, for someone, literally with my specific set of services, it does
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.800]   make sense to keep prime.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:50.320]   If anything else, it makes sense to go even further into the Amazon ecosystem because
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:56.040]   I can say, I personally can save money by doing prime and Amazon music unlimited because
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.240]   they have the high-fi, they save me from pay for Spotify or Cobas.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.280]   They're very, very specific reason, but it's the type of thing where it's like, you should
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.760]   go over with a fine-tooth comb.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   Who are you giving money to every single month?
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.440]   I get the sense that a lot of consumers out there, $5 here, they don't really think of
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:19.000]   it, but I'm here to tell you that stuff adds up and all these little streaming services
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.720]   they want you to subscribe to to watch the Flavor of the Month television show, which
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.680]   is invariably, who care, it's great, let's say it's great, whatever.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.360]   It's like, these things cost money and money doesn't grow on tree.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:34.680]   So I really do think that asking people, you know, a little more, a little more, a little
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:41.600]   more, it may just backfire because I don't know the people are going to put up with it.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:47.000]   It certainly is, you know, if you're a family with, with, with, with, with, but never mind
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.680]   inflation, never, have you bought like a kind of chicken breast recently or milk?
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   Like prices are going up very, very high and for, and now prime wants more money.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   I don't know.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:04.360]   It's very, I don't think it's a good look, especially given how much money Amazon made
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.920]   through the pandemic, through this recent quarter.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.200]   Now they're like an advertising juggernaut.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.480]   So you want an extra $2 a month out of me?
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.600]   Why don't you just, you know, it just, it just smells fishy.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:21.800]   So that's my, it's also the case that primate sense when it was because it was free second
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.160]   day shipping when you would always get that.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.760]   But a lot of times now you don't.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:34.040]   And no, I will say in the past year, I've had several packages delayed, just gone missing
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   the other day.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.080]   I, you know, see, a very specific example.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.960]   I bought Ghost of Tsushima PS5 game.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.600]   I was supposed to get here Saturday and I was supposed to hear Friday.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.600]   It arrived here today.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.960]   Now, is that a big deal?
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.360]   No, obviously not.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.920]   But the point is I'm paying for prime to get, you know, at most two days.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.800]   So what am I paying for exactly?
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.560]   This might be the wrong time to raise prime because, you know, maybe the shipping thing
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.760]   is because of COVID and it's going to get better.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.760]   Sure.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.320]   But, or supply chain or whatever excuse you want to use.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.320]   Sure.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.880]   Because this is now and this is when you're raising it.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:12.040]   By the way, Yahoo Finance, actually Bloomberg pointed out that a lot that almost half, a
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:19.360]   little more than half, I'm sorry, 52% of Amazon prime members are monthly members.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:27.960]   So they're going to $180 a year, which really makes you wonder, is it worth the money?
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:33.640]   I would just advise folks to really look, you know, a calculator and see where your money
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.480]   is going every month because it may not be worth it depending.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.840]   And it may, you know, it may not be worth it if you just tweak your things a little.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:46.120]   It's like, oh, well, if I shop over here or if I treat my shopping habits this way, you
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.640]   know, you can make this so that it works for you.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:54.200]   You don't have to be, you know, beholden to any, any really nearly pricing increase.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.760]   I do encourage folks to like take the time to look at this stuff because it's important.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.360]   And you know, these companies, they don't care, I guess, even though they're making money
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.160]   hand over fist, you know, no one's looking after you.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.400]   So that's my rant with the prime pricing.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.200]   And by the way, I am an NFL fan and I actually would pay Amazon not to do Thursday not football.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.560]   Keep it on, keep it on CBS and ESPN Amazon.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.480]   That was a huge request to do a terrible job.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.720]   They do a terrible job.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.920]   Yeah, there were say a lot of folks were saying, can you just like maybe, maybe there
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.000]   needs to be two tiers of prime service, one where it's just the prime shipping as it used
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.840]   to be back in the day.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.320]   And then one with like all prime plus call with all this other stuff.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   Okay, great.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.960]   But a lot of folks are literally just here for the free two day shipping.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.680]   And now prime is like, all this value, all this stuff, it's like, well, I don't, I don't
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.040]   use this stuff.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.440]   Why am I paying for it?
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.120]   People just get frustrated and like, it's, it's, it's highly understandable.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.000]   The change goes into effect February 18th.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.760]   If you're a new subscriber, if you're existing prime subscriber, renew now because if you
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.720]   were in renew after March 25th, that's when it goes up.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.400]   So if you can renew now, you'll save that $20.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.400]   It's not about the $20.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:08.520]   It's really about thinking about, well, what am I getting for what is now more than $10
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.520]   a month?
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.000]   You know, that's, that's a lot of money.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.680]   My question is bundled in there.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.160]   Oh, that's the other question.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.160]   Who the hell knows?
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.080]   Who's running Amazon, who's running Amazon PR?
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:26.480]   Like how, how did anyone inside Amazon allow this to be rolled out as part of the earnings
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.480]   announcement?
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:36.240]   And we made $141 billion this, this quarter and oh by the way, they had Amazon profits
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.800]   were $14.3 billion in the quarter.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.600]   It's a trillion dollar company now.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   Oh, and by the way, we want more money from you.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.640]   So tone death and think of all the, think of all the union organizers.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.160]   We're going to say, look at how much, you know, look at how much money Amazon reported
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.520]   making and they're raising the price on prime.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.360]   And what are they, you know, what are they giving you?
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.960]   Amazon's PR is not great.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.400]   Remember how they fumbled the sidewalk announcement and got everybody to say, oh, I don't want
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   that.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.600]   They, they're maybe they're not the most accomplished.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:16.080]   And they spend all this time fighting with reporters.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.680]   Like there's, there's actually a team that is devoted to, you know, you know, asking
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.400]   for corrections, whether or not a correction is, is merited.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.440]   And if they, you know, like, and they're not doing their job, they're not doing their
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.000]   job of like presenting a positive image of Amazon or like, is that a left, is that a
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.800]   hangover from Bezos who was pretty combative?
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:43.280]   I remember his ex Mackenzie writing a nasty review of the Amazon book, the everything
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.960]   store, putting it on Amazon.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.360]   I think Bezos is kind of combative.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.320]   I wonder if Andy Jassy, the new CEO will maybe tone that down a little bit.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.080]   It's not a good, it's, I mean, here we are tech journalists.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:01.000]   So obviously we don't like it, but it's not a good look to get in fights with people who
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.160]   buy ink by the barrel, as they say.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.160]   What do you get?
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.160]   I don't know.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:11.960]   Maybe two day delivery, prime video, which is pretty good.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:17.160]   Somebody in the, and the chat room is a cap J is saying, well, you should just drop your
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.440]   Netflix and that'll make up the difference.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.920]   The problem is not everything's on Amazon prime.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.320]   There's stuff on Netflix that you want to see.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:31.480]   I mean, in fact, Amazon prime of all of the streaming services, maybe that's, there's,
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.040]   I don't know, is that one of the, I guess you feel like the expanse?
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.840]   Yeah, there's good stuff on there, I guess.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.560]   This is a big show that people like they also do include, you know, to their credit currently,
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.960]   they include free unlimited photo storage.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.720]   That was one of the reasons why I was like, okay, maybe I'll, I'll go all in on Amazon.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.440]   Now do you get your music free?
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.520]   No, you still pay for your music with Amazon prime.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.160]   They have Amazon music.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:59.080]   They have kind of like, like, like a thin tier that is free with.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.080]   Two million songs.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.720]   So with 70 million songs and high, you have to pay for music unlimited, which if you have
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:13.040]   prime is 799 a month, which is less than, that's less than the 999 for Apple music,
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.600]   Cobas, which is a smaller service, which is high five.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.960]   That's like, like 12 dollars a month.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:23.480]   So it is, you know, you also get like random magazines, like, you know, the February issue
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:28.280]   of, I don't know, business week or like food never magazine, which is like, cool.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.960]   I'm not, I'm not opposed to that, but it just feels so random.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.000]   And like, it's just on a website, like a list of like PDFs.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.120]   Same thing with the, with the books.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.520]   You get the Kindle unlimited, but it's like, I don't know what kind of books are on there.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.520]   Right.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   You don't get audible.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.520]   You don't get comics.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.680]   No, no, no.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:50.520]   And they could have very easily like lowered the price of Amazon music prime or, you know,
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:56.320]   or like rolled out, you know, oh, you're getting this much more, you know, free tiers or like
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.200]   we're boosting, you know, we're boosting what's on prime video.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.080]   Like they didn't package it with any benefit to the consumer.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.480]   I think this is my prime.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.120]   See, I think this is a test.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.040]   I think Amazon's curious.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:18.720]   They know that for some people, this will trigger an ex, like, like Dan or Nicholas,
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.040]   a trigger, a reexamination.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.600]   And they're curious, well, how many people, how price sensitive are people to these subscriptions?
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.400]   How far can we push the in the everything store?
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.440]   Or maybe it's his successor to that Amazon on bound.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   I think it's in the everything store.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.960]   He talked, which is a great, both books are great about Amazon.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:44.560]   He talks about the pricing of Amazon prime and they had no idea what to charge.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.280]   They just pulled the number out of thin air.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.360]   They had no idea what it would cost them.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.920]   There was actually a significant risk.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:55.600]   It would be a big money loser that a two day shipping would end up costing much more.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.120]   Turned out to not be the case.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:02.360]   It was a very, it was a huge success with probably the most successful membership club
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   since Costco.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:11.920]   I'm just a changing of norms or at least pushing norms in a particular direction to test the
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   boundaries.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.920]   That's what I think.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   That's what I think.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.960]   Now, maybe I'm a cynical guy.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:21.700]   I have read, it's Brad Stone, by the way, both of those books, which are fascinating
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.480]   studies in business and psychology.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.920]   A lot of what, at least Jeff Bezos would do, would be like that.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:28.920]   Well, let's see.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.120]   If we change it 20 bucks, let's see what happens.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.880]   See if Dan Patterson notices.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:39.760]   Leo, you're saying that they sat around in their Seattle headquarters and said, "Why
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.920]   don't we make this announcement as ham-handed a fashion platform?"
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.040]   See if anybody notices.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   That's why their PR is so defensive.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:55.760]   I'm like, "Damn it, I got to sell this?"
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   How about Prime Day?
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   That's pretty successful.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.080]   Then that's probably a driver.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.760]   Maybe that'll be the time to announce this Prime Day instead of during your earnings
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.000]   call.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.720]   I'm here on the Prime website on Amazon.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.880]   I'm going to press Explore My Benefits.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:18.200]   Here's a page that probably not many people go to.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:24.040]   Free two-day, free one-day, free same day, free ultra-fast grocery, prescription delivery,
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:28.800]   release date delivery, no rush shipping, Amazon Day.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.640]   That's the one where you pick a day and all of your stuff comes on the same day.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:38.120]   Which see, I guess that eliminates truck emissions.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:43.080]   Key by Amazon where you give the driver your garage door key and they leave your package
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.640]   inside.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.840]   Prime video, Prime Video, channels, Amazon Music Prime, discount on Amazon Music Unlimited
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.560]   Prime Gaming.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.800]   What's that?
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.120]   I think you get free DLC for certain games.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:03.040]   Which is, I'm against my huge free time is gaming, but free game apps.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.440]   Free in-game content though, right?
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   No, something else.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.200]   No, Loon is separate.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.360]   Amazon Photos, which is a good deal.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:16.080]   It's free unlimited, well not free, but included with membership unlimited full resolution
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.600]   photo storage.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.440]   Google charges for that now.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.000]   Amazon Kids Plus.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.080]   I'm not going to go through the whole list.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.240]   It's a lot of stuff.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:33.320]   The whole foods savings, it's no longer whole paycheck if you have Prime.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.320]   Oh, see?
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   See?
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.320]   Pretty substantial.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:44.040]   All they had to do was say, oh, and by the way, we're going to give you $20 off $100
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:49.520]   at Whole Foods for your first year to offset the increase, which they could easily.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.400]   I think they got that in their back pocket.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.560]   They're saying, let's see what happens.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.600]   Then if Dan Patterson quits, we're going to give you 20 bucks.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.600]   Let's just see.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:06.760]   Do you actually take out your phone and scan your Amazon Prime code when you're at Whole
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.760]   Paycheck?
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.760]   I do.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   Do you really?
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   I can't.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.840]   I say, I do the Amazon Go thing too.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   Oh, do you?
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.400]   You probably don't have those up in the north bay.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.400]   No.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   All right.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:27.840]   You also get prime exclusive shipping benefits on Woot.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.880]   Amazon owns so many things.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.200]   They own like fabric.com.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.760]   They own Zappos.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:42.480]   They own like a lot of Zappos you get free shipping as Zappos.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:51.200]   So yeah, maybe this is like, I'm not going to quit because they're going to buy everything
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.000]   eventually and I want to keep my membership.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.480]   There's also the Prime Visa card, which I do have, which it's 5% cash back and anything
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.440]   bought at Amazon.com.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:05.440]   So I use that if you're not a prime member that drops to 3%, so I'm further incentivized
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   to shop from Amazon.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.440]   Which I make your money.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.040]   I don't especially mine to be honest.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.640]   But yeah, it's just like, where's my money going here?
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.720]   I don't, you know.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:23.600]   And if you had to put it all together yourself, I think that might be hard to do.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:30.160]   So, all right, I was trying to gin up consumer outrage.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.320]   And instead we've just said, yeah, that's a pretty good deal actually.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   I think I'll stay.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.960]   I think I'll keep it.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:39.160]   I think I'm pretty sure the journal wrote a story is prime still worth it the other day.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.120]   It's got a lot of people are talking.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.200]   And again, it's a fairly small price, 2000 month, not that.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.240]   But a lot of people are like, huh, anyway, what is what's going on here?
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.960]   The journal's conclusion.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.840]   Here's why it's still worth it.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.840]   There you go.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.840]   We're all in the tank.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.160]   We're all in the tank for Jeff and the company.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:04.680]   By the way, the mayor of the Dutch city says, we're not taking apart the bridge.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.360]   Don't worry.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.360]   You saw that story.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   Jeff Bezos is new yacht.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:13.400]   Again, not a good luck, Jeff.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:19.120]   While you're raising prime costs, Jeff Bezos is new yacht is so big that the shipyard where
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:25.440]   they make it said you got to dismantle the bridge.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.680]   I like Jalopnik's headline on this.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:34.840]   Here's the boat that won't bring Jeff Bezos his hair or his wife back.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.840]   Feel the second hand shame.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.880]   $540 million mega yacht.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.880]   So big.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:50.800]   Built by a company in Holland called Oceano that it can't fit through the bridge.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:57.520]   Although again, I have to find that article, but I saw the article that said the mayor
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.840]   said, no, no, no, because he was getting a lot of pushback.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:06.760]   We're not going to dismantle the historic bridge just for that yacht.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.280]   All right.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:12.680]   You guys are so quiet.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.520]   I was expecting more feistiness over prime.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.400]   Let me see if I can find something that'll upset you.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.080]   Something that'll get you mad.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:29.680]   How about I've been saving this, but I guess it's time to play the Rogan card.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.200]   Yeah, here we go.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.680]   It's interesting.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.800]   John Stewart said, knock it off, everybody.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:44.000]   John Stewart, leftist journalist, the Daily Show host.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.120]   He's now got a show on Apple.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.200]   Maybe it's because he's on Apple now.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.640]   He can't be so.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.440]   He says, people should not call for Joe to be censored or canceled.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.520]   I actually believe it or I kind of agree.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.760]   I don't want to see censorship.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.920]   But boy, the hate fest continues.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.360]   There's now a super cut of Joe Rogan using the N word.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.440]   Pretty old stuff.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:15.240]   There's a video of him laughing hysterically while a fellow comic talks about sexual abuse.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:21.640]   It feels like the guns and knives are out for Joe Rogan.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.040]   Anyone have an opinion on that, Dan?
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.200]   You're a journalist.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.040]   What should Spotify do about Joe Rogan?
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.480]   They are going to post a disclaimer, apparently.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.920]   Well, definitely journalists shouldn't advise on policy.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:41.600]   And I mean, nobody wants to be accused or engaged in censorship.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:48.400]   But I think it's fair that if you say offensive things like the N word repeatedly or you have
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:54.000]   people who are pretty close to racists and Nazi sympathizers like the people he's had
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.920]   on, especially in the early days.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.720]   I think if you have people like Sargon of Akkad who have said horrible things about
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.160]   women.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:14.840]   I think if you advance a ton of misinformation about COVID and vaccines, then it's okay for
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.880]   people to say that is offensive.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:22.080]   And if you take $100 million, that means that Spotify owns you.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.340]   You work for them.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.880]   They're not a platform like Facebook.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:31.200]   It's not analogous to Twitter or QAnon that we find offensive and maybe we want to get.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.200]   It's not the same.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.320]   It works for them.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:38.520]   And it's fair for an employer to say, hey, we don't like you saying the N word.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.320]   We're taking the content down.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   Spotify.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:45.520]   So the whole censorship argument, I have no idea.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.520]   I have no idea.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.400]   Nobody wants to engage in censorship.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.840]   I happen to think that maybe that's a little bit of a red herring.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.320]   And it's a distracting argument.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.440]   It does not talk about the victims.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:00.680]   What about people who don't like hearing the N word?
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:03.560]   Because it's a really offensive term.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:11.160]   What about the fact that misinformation at scale about vaccines is harmful?
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:16.800]   I mean, talking about Joe Rogan, I think, focuses a conversation on Joe Rogan.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.520]   And that's great.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.480]   It's great for his attention.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.280]   But it doesn't talk about the victims.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:29.000]   And I don't ever want to be in a position where censorship is bad.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.640]   Yeah, sure is bad.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.880]   Well, you know what?
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.240]   He's done some things that many people have been hurt by.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:40.080]   And let's maybe talk about those people and the fact that Spotify paid him $100 million
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.080]   to do that.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.080]   Also, censorship is done by governments.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.080]   Yes.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.480]   Spotify is not a government.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.640]   No, there is a employer.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.600]   They're not by the way, they're not.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.640]   He says they say, we don't own him.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.280]   We are not his employer.
[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.080]   We gave him $100 million so that he would be exclusive on our platform.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.080]   But we do not own the...
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.080]   What's the difference?
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.680]   Well, we don't own the show.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.080]   We don't employ him.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.480]   And last week made the point, a good point, you get...
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.680]   You're not Joe off Spotify.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:16.320]   You actually more people will hear him if he goes back to YouTube and plain old podcasting.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.160]   Right now as a Spotify exclusive, you have to listen through Spotify.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.160]   I think one big mental fix for thinking about these is to stop using the word platform.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.160]   Like, do not allow it.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.360]   Facebook is not a platform.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.000]   It's a social network.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.680]   Spotify is an internet broadcaster.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:35.440]   Airbnb is a lodging marketplace.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.760]   Uber is a ride-hailing service.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:44.240]   Once you start calling things what they actually are, it really clarifies policy decisions.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.240]   It's darn good.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:54.400]   It clarifies how we should view actions.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:01.280]   We view CBS as just a pick on Dan's employer as responsible for what is broadcast on CBS.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.880]   Yeah, if Dan started spouting this, they'd fire him.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.720]   Look, you asked me my opinion at the very onset of the show.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.200]   You asked me my opinions.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.800]   And about a topic I don't even remember now.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.960]   But I squirmed a little bit because I had to...
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.240]   You're not used to giving an opinion.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.120]   It's not my job to express opinions.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120]   It's not my job.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   That's so old-fashioned.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.120]   I love it.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.360]   Well, I mean, look, it really isn't.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.160]   I don't even think that that's old-fashioned.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.760]   I think that that harms the trust relationship I have with audiences.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.760]   I agree, I understand.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.440]   I don't mean I'll fashion it in a bad way.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.440]   It's a good thing.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.920]   I just can't do my job.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.920]   People can't trust me.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.920]   And guess what?
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.440]   People don't trust Joe Rogan either.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.080]   And now they don't trust Spotify.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.080]   Right.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.640]   And it's fair.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.680]   It's been a surprising pushback.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.920]   I thought when Neil Young said, "Well, I'm on my music off."
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.040]   Spotify's reaction was probably like mine like, "Well, fine, Neil, go ahead."
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.640]   Big deal, but actually it's hurt them quite a bit.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.080]   With the other artist, Nils Loffgren and Joni Mitchell and podcasters saying, "Yeah, we
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.960]   don't want to be on this platform."
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.280]   It actually seems to have hurt them.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.480]   There seems to be a movement to cancel Spotify memberships.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:15.760]   The funny thing is a lot of musicians came forward saying, "Oh, yeah, we're going to
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.920]   take our stuff off of Spotify, too."
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.200]   And then they discovered, or someone reminded them, they sold off their publishing rights.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.200]   Whoops.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.200]   It's not up to you.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.200]   It's not up to you.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.200]   It's a private equity firm.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.200]   Talk to Ask Dad.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.200]   It's not up to you.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.880]   I guess I would say I have a pretty, I don't know, I think a pretty interesting take on
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.880]   this.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.840]   I've been listening to Rogan basically since day one.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.400]   I used to listen to Howard Stern and Opie and Anthony as a young man.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.040]   And Rogan was always on the time on the Opie and Anthony show.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.480]   This is like 2005, '67.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.880]   So this is a very long time ago.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.840]   Back in the day, he used to talk a lot about ancient aliens and exoplanets.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.840]   Was he?
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.800]   Can I ask you, because I am not, I've never listened to the podcast.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.720]   I'm somewhat familiar with him.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.320]   Was he ever a stand up?
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.680]   They call him a comedian.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.280]   So he did do stand up.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.880]   Yeah, he's got a bunch of specials.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.280]   Yeah, he's a stand up comedian.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280]   Okay.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.440]   So stand up, say all sorts of nutty things.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.440]   Sure.
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.440]   And it's understood.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440]   It's comedy.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   I mean, you could still get canceled as a stand up.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.720]   God knows, but there's a certain understanding that you push the limits.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.200]   Stern pushed the limits.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.640]   It's funny to see the Rogan debate pop up because I was actually part of a podcast a
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:32.200]   couple of years ago where we analyzed what was called the Joe Rogan experience experience.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.240]   We had like four episodes.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.640]   The problem was that man produces such a volume of content that is impossible to listen
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.760]   and to like take notes on that stuff.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.480]   So if anyone's been like listening closely to what this man has been saying for the
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.920]   length of his career, it's kind of been me.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:53.440]   And I just wanted to add, you know, as you've got a Joe Rogan expert on the show.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.080]   I'm also look, I've also been racially abused in my life.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.080]   It is not fun.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.880]   Yeah, I could think of every.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.920]   There is one particular instance why I felt very I was not going to get into it.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.120]   But to have your person who diminished because of the color of your skin is not fun.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.800]   Having said that as that person, I listened to his, you know, obviously you really can't
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.640]   defend the viral video that came out this weekend that's indefensible.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:24.360]   But like just some like spicy humor is like, I don't know, it's never bothered me.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.520]   Is that is that my family background is I've been around this kind of content.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:33.320]   You know, frankly, my family is a very blue collar family, a lot of law enforcement.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:39.480]   It is not exactly as a waspy family that is offended by like words and stuff.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:46.280]   So that I don't know if like, you know, the elite media has a very similar background.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:51.080]   But yeah, it is it is it is very interesting to see, like you said, the knives come out.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:56.080]   I personally as someone who has listened, I don't listen as much anymore just because
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.400]   I can't stand the COVID talk.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400]   I'm over this.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:04.880]   I talk about like, it's like it's like, it's like, it's it's too much.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.200]   It's like if you're hosting like a radio show, it's like, can we get on to another topic?
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.360]   I do wish he would go back to, you know, like the aliens and like, you know, he had the
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.960]   UFC fighters on like, like I like that stuff.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:22.960]   The focus of the show really seems to have fallen off, fallen off with the move.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.080]   And you know, it was great that you guys had the Spotify debate last week because I was
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.600]   like, you know, I'm Spotify.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.760]   Is this even worth the trouble anymore?
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.200]   Like have people join Spotify, Spotify premium because Rogan is there, you know, they'll
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.200]   show growth right?
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.440]   But would that growth have occurred?
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.320]   Anyway, I see that big of a draw that it is worth the constant and unrelent, the relentless
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:48.480]   like news cycle, like focus on this man.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.960]   I don't know that it is.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.240]   Ultimately, this is probably good for him, right?
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.440]   More people know about him and probably more people.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.960]   And the idea and I also think it's kind of funny.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.240]   Let's say Spotify's, you know, this is actually not worth our trouble.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.720]   We're not good by Rogan.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.280]   There's some clause in the contract with a, they sever the relationship.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.720]   Are people gonna like, who is mega fans?
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:12.640]   Are they gonna all of a sudden start reading like the Atlantic or are they gonna, like,
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.280]   that's not happening.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.480]   So like, I don't, I kind of understand, you know, I don't think you should be saying fake
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.640]   things about the vaccine.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.240]   Like obviously, not a fool, but like the idea that the people listening to this are all
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:28.360]   of a sudden going to be, going to be listening to, to Edward R. Murrow or whatever is like,
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.720]   that seems fanciful and fake.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.760]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:37.360]   And I kind of think that maybe the bothers folks at this, this, this meathead who is
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.840]   a commentator in MMA has such a reach and influence.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.200]   Maybe like bothers people.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.280]   I don't know.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.840]   But yeah, that's sort of, that's sort of my take.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.680]   I, I, I, as, as a one time fan of this guy, I wish he would kind of get away from this
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.120]   stuff because exhausting and it is not fun.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:58.560]   It's just not a fun, you know, let's, let's get back to ancient civilizations and that
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.560]   type of thing.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:05.160]   That was, as a young man, that, that was interesting talk and he doesn't do that as much anymore.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.240]   I, you know, I listen to Stern too and sometimes it's offensive.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:13.320]   Sometimes it's like, I can't believe you're talking about this, but you can turn it off.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:22.360]   And I guess the big issue is if he's giving advice to people who believe it about health,
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:29.200]   which is where he has no expertise or he's having pseudo experts on and people are listening
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:35.440]   to it and not getting and actually risking their lives because of it is what then, then
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.840]   what do you do?
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.760]   Because I'm not, I'm not for shutting people's voices down.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.160]   I think we just have to.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.280]   Yeah, I think he acknowledged on one of his, he's done a couple of apology videos in the
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280]   past week or so.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.640]   I think in one of them, he said, yeah, maybe we should step away from this.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.280]   Maybe I should have, I should be better informed.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.080]   I think he know it's kind of, you know, obviously I don't know him.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.960]   I was a fan from way back.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.920]   It feels like the show has gotten out of control.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.160]   It has gotten so big that maybe like the power has gotten, this was a show, again, this was
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.680]   a show he was live streaming from like his basement or whatever, talking about the co-op.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.680]   And it's like he's so big and it's so proud.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.600]   You got that rush of like, you know, people wanting to deplatform him.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:20.920]   He's his fans egging him on when everything has to, everything has to become that doesn't
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.080]   it these days.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.680]   Well, I think that's the challenge here.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:31.720]   I don't like the polarized conversation.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.680]   I don't think anybody does, but I think it's fair to like, I listened to Rogan for a long
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.400]   time too.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:45.440]   In 2017 and 2018, I heard really offensive stuff about women and about people of color.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.160]   And I stopped listening because I heard a lot of offensive stuff.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.880]   I don't recall thinking this guy should be canceled.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.080]   What I did is dial out.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.800]   And I think that there is a nuanced conversation that can be had here.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:04.320]   I agree that maybe nobody is going to stop listening to Joe Rogan and start reading The
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.320]   Atlantic.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:13.240]   But I think that it is fair to say, I find this offensive and I find that the profit from
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.040]   that to also be offensive.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.440]   And that's fair and fine to say.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.040]   I don't think that dismissing that is helpful.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:31.320]   Well, and just to give you some ammunition here, according to the Verge, who talked to an ad
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:36.640]   buyer who wished to be anonymous, it's a million dollars an ad to get an ad on the Joe
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.640]   Rogan experience.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.160]   It is absolutely a money maker.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.400]   That money does go to Joe, of course, but Spotify sells the ad.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.720]   So it's part of the Spotify ad network.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.800]   So it is very good for Spotify's business, whether they'll make a hundred million dollars
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.800]   in a year or two.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800]   I don't know.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:00.080]   But there's no question it's added to their subscriber base and they make good money on
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.080]   the advertisements.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:07.440]   And it's also to me, it's like, there's, sorry, there's clearly a demand for this talk.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.880]   It's like, it feels like one of like the unspoken, oh, this, he's so popular.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   Let's let you know.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.880]   Spotify has a release number.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.600]   But Joe says 11 million listeners per episode.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.040]   That's like, I don't know if I credit that, but that's a lot.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:24.160]   That's a huge number of people who are listening to this guy who are not consuming other forms
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160]   of media.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.440]   And I think it's like, why, why are people attracted to this?
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.400]   Are those are like interesting media questions?
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.400]   Don't come.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.400]   Don't come.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.780]   comics often ask this though, isn't this kind of a common discussion among comics?
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.780]   What is my responsibility?
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:40.960]   As you become huge, do I change my act?
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.040]   Do I change my stick or do I stick with what I'm doing?
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.640]   What's my responsibility now that I have a large audience?
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.040]   I think it has to be a comic to ask those questions.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.040]   I came from radio.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040]   I remember this.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.040]   I'm a journalist.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.360]   I ask myself those questions all the time.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.080]   You can be a normal person and ask yourself, what's my responsibility to the culture and
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.440]   society in which I live, especially if I'm profiting from something.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:07.200]   I don't think this has, I look, I, I agree with a lot of what we're talking about here,
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.320]   but I don't like the, let's wrap this in comedy.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.320]   Let's wrap this in.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.640]   I'm just an entertainer.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   Those all seem like easy excuses for not taking responsibility.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   I mean, do and say what you want.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:27.200]   That's fine, but you don't get it in out just because you're a comedian.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.480]   I don't get it out for being a journalist and getting out for responsibility.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.200]   He does, let's face it, he sells vitamins and stuff.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:42.680]   Yes, maybe some incentive to say, well, you just need these immune pills instead of a
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:50.240]   COVID vaccine, which would be reprehensible if he's profiting from misinformation.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.040]   There are those who say, in fact, there's an Atlantic article from a couple of years
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.320]   ago that Joe Rogan is so popular because he understands men in America better than most
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.080]   people do and we should be paying attention.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:06.840]   It's no surprises to young guys who listen to Rogan a lot.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:07.840]   Did he speak?
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.320]   I certainly did a lot when I was young.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.600]   Did he speak to you as a young guy as a young man?
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600]   It was like, he's...
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.400]   I mean, more than like, you know, barons or something like that.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   Right, right.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.400]   Nicholas, I found the same content.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.960]   I mean, I think a lot of people use the YouTube discovery in engine when I would be
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.080]   editing a story or something.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.640]   It was fairly, I could listen to something else.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.120]   Definitely, I wanted to hear about spaceships and I wanted to hear maybe a talk with the
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.120]   guy from Tool and I wanted to hear Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:47.760]   It's when you bundle that in with the sargon of a cod or the, you know, he had some...
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.640]   Maybe I shouldn't name names, but he had some people who have fairly reprehensible beliefs
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.480]   on it and he platformed them.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.520]   He amplified them.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.120]   And I think that there's a responsibility there.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.120]   I'm not saying, oh, let's cancel pitchforks, but I'm saying that maybe there should be a
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.960]   responsibility and wrapping it in comedy seems like an easy out.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.760]   Sure, but as a listener, I don't know who's sargon.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.520]   Like, if I'm listening to this, it's like I'm not into it.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.880]   I'm gonna turn it off.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.240]   If he's interviewing, you know, Michael Bisping of the UFC, I'm probably gonna listen to that.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.920]   Like you said earlier, it's like if I'm the engineer, I could tune out of it.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.720]   You know, if there's a controversial comedian coming to the local, you know, chuckle huts,
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.480]   I don't have to go.
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.720]   His fans will go whether does everybody like that comedian?
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.720]   Probably not.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.800]   But if the man has fans and they go and they pay and they...
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.440]   I don't necessarily have like an ideological problem with that, I guess.
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.800]   And for advertisers, you know, they might object to some of the content, but they're
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.680]   looking at it from the perspective of, you know, these are people who are probably not
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.120]   gonna watch CNN, probably not gonna listen to the audience.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.520]   They are hard to reach.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.960]   And Spotify sells packages of ads where like, if you want to buy Joe Rogan, you have to
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.960]   buy other ads on the Spotify network.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.960]   So it's more than just the 100 million, more than just the 250 million.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.280]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.200]   I'm sorry to bring up the Joe Rogan thing.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.200]   I just wanted to just...
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.440]   It's a funny piece of people.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.440]   You're not sorry.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.440]   You're not sorry.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.480]   Sorry, not sorry.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.160]   Not at all.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.960]   Our show today brought to you by podium.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.760]   You know text messaging is the best way to talk to your customers.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.880]   That's how they want to hear from you.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.720]   They don't want you to call them.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.720]   They don't...
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.240]   Who wants junk mail?
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.120]   Who wants email?
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.080]   We want text messages.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:48.040]   If you own a business that just aren't enough hours in a day to waste playing phone tag,
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.240]   the list of customers you need to reach doesn't get any shorter, especially when business
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.240]   is good.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:59.240]   That's why local businesses everywhere turn to podium, podium, podium, P-O-D-I-U-M makes
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.360]   every interaction as easy as sending a text.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.000]   So everything that makes your business great can get done faster.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.280]   I'm noticing more and more businesses around me are using podium, my dentist when I leave,
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.120]   says, "Leave a review."
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.120]   Or they...
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.120]   No, I love it.
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:15.360]   They send me my appointment.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.400]   So I just click it and it's added to my calendar.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.380]   You can collect payments with podium.
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.760]   You can market to your customers.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.240]   The ice cream store in town sends me a...
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.480]   It's the worst thing ever.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.040]   Every few weeks we miss you.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.440]   Here's a coupon for 30% off ice cream.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.440]   No!
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.440]   (laughs)
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.440]   Potium does it.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.440]   It works.

[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.760]   A lot of times that's how you can get a job issue a quote.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:53.760]   People text you.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760]   You text them back.

[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840]   Potium.com/twit.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:27.280]   What do you think?
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.120]   Is the pandemic coming to close?
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.120]   Are we up?
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.880]   I feel like it's all over.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.600]   It's over.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.200]   Go home.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.200]   Go out of your home.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.040]   Go to work.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.880]   Stop working at home.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.040]   Do you feel that?
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.440]   Do you feel that sudden like, you know, I'm watching a football game and there's a 100,000
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.440]   people without mess.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.920]   Just sitting cheering and everything.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920]   No?
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.920]   I don't know.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.200]   I'm in New York and it definitely doesn't feel like it's over.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.320]   But you guys are shell-shocked.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.320]   You got PTSD.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.480]   I mean, you've had two big searches.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.800]   You were maybe fewer people.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:10.640]   All McCrond was, was, felt December and early January, felt a lot like March, 2020.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:18.240]   I, we're, I was supposed to go to the office tomorrow, but we're just going to do a remote
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.640]   hit.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.640]   So I don't know.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.120]   I mean, I think we were supposed to be back in the office in January and then it's, so
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.120]   who knows?
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:30.440]   I don't, I don't think that this doesn't feel over to me.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.600]   I'm near, I'm, I'm, I'm in Hudson Valley.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:38.840]   So let's call it two hours north of New York City and it's not over up here, but I was
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.560]   visiting, visiting a friend of the city of the day.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:48.400]   It is over-ish up here, you know, masks, people wearing masks and our county executive
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.480]   said he was not going to enforce the New York State mask requirement.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.880]   So it's kind of kind of weird, but it feels like it's, it's maybe winding down a little
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   bit.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:03.640]   But inside CR, we have been working from home since March of 2020.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:07.560]   I have not been back to the office in Yonkers since March of 2020.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.800]   I may actually go back in a month or two.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.800]   We're testing.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.800]   Do you miss it?
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.800]   Do you want to go back?
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.800]   No.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.800]   Do I miss the office?
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.800]   No, no, no, no.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.440]   It's, it's a nice office too.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.120]   It was, it's the nicest office I've ever worked in as a matter of fact, but I've had the most
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:28.440]   productive years in my life as a worker be working for any organization over the past
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.440]   years.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.080]   So I don't know, but yeah.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.080]   So who's not, who knows?
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:38.000]   I mean, there's going to be a lot of news because we're going to hit a million deaths,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.040]   you know, that's for sure.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.800]   And there's going to be a lot of news about that.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:44.880]   But as a start, I don't know.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.880]   What do you think?
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.520]   Am I, I feel, I just feel a lightning.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:53.280]   And at the same time, I notice I'm, I don't, I'm not uncomfortable wearing a mask.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.960]   So I might still wear a mask all the time.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:55.960]   I don't know.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.960]   What, what do you think going?
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:05.000]   You know, San Francisco has been kind of, you know, we've been pretty far out there
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.840]   in terms of masking like the Bay Area, as you know, was one of the first areas is to
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.720]   shelter in place voluntarily before the state went, you know, went to shelter in place.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.400]   So it feels like overall we've handled it really well.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:27.000]   You know, the, the continued weird thing is that, you know, speaking here from downtown,
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:35.280]   ironically, in an office is that many employers are, you know, have gone remote first or they've
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:39.720]   postponed yet again, returned to office.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:45.920]   I think that might be one of the, one of the reasons it's not over is we've kind of normalized
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.480]   this way of life and we like it.
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.000]   And I don't, I think, you know, people are traveling like crazy.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.320]   The TSA numbers are really back to normal.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.960]   They're flying, they're traveling, they're going places.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.040]   But I think a lot of people don't want to go back to the office.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.720]   And so that may not happen.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.720]   I don't know.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.080]   I mean, even for certain jobs, like my job, I'm basically in Google Docs and on the phone
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.600]   or on Zoom all day.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.960]   That is basically, you don't need to be in the office.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.080]   I could do that from Jupiter.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.080]   It doesn't necessarily matter.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.720]   You know, a decade ago or more than a decade ago when I was at TechCrunch, I was also working
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:20.320]   from home, you know, TechCrunch had offices in San Francisco, New York at the time, and
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:24.440]   I would go into the New York office every now and then, but I would work from home and
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.960]   it was not, I didn't, you know, I wasn't building Toyotas.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:31.520]   I was writing articles in Google Docs and talking on the phone to people.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:37.880]   So it's like, does my job, if I'm a business owner, do I need an office with X-many seats?
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:43.120]   If I could just have the folks work from home, why am I going to pay for that office space?
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.120]   So I guess we'll see.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.120]   I agree.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.000]   I think that one of the bigger things coming out of the pandemic will be people's relationship
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.280]   to their jobs and what is my labor good for?
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:55.160]   Do I need to be in any specific place to do this?
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:00.000]   You know, obviously if you have, you know, my brother is a forklift driver in a warehouse.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.800]   He cannot do that remotely.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.160]   He's been going to the office this whole time.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.440]   I'm different.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:09.000]   So it does sort of depend on what you're doing.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.640]   How does he feel about the pandemic and so forth?
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.760]   How is, he's had to work.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.760]   He's, he's had to work.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.280]   I, I, I, I'm reluctant to give his true opinion.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.560]   It's a slightly spicy opinion.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:28.160]   I think he would say something along the lines of, you know, people who are so lucky to work
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:32.400]   from home don't like don't talk to me type of thing.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   No, I don't blame him at all for that.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   I mean, yeah.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.960]   There's so many people who are who had to go to work regardless.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   He's, he's a little younger.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:42.960]   He's, he's 26.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:47.200]   So he, you know, he'll see articles online and we're like, oh, going back to the office,
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.200]   should we, should we?
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:53.680]   And he just shakes his head in so many words that he's like, whatever, bro, whatever.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:59.240]   He doesn't have a lot of time for, or a lot of sympathy for people in my position to
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   be honest.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.880]   I mean, I, you know, I'm, I'm recording a podcast from our office because it's just
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:06.880]   more convenient.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:10.040]   You know, I don't have to worry about someone ringing the doorbell.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:15.320]   You know, we live in a relatively small San Francisco apartment.
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.760]   Have you been to a movie theater?
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.760]   No.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:23.360]   And, you know, one of our, one of our favorite theaters, you know, one where my husband and
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.280]   I saw so many movies just closed.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.280]   The Embarcadero Center.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.920]   Oh, that's sad.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.400]   Great, great little movie theater.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   Close forever.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400]   Close.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.120]   As far as we know, forever.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.120]   Wow.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.120]   That's possible.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.800]   Someone might reopen it as a, as a theater.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:48.920]   But yeah, it's, you know, and it's hard for that category of like art house theater.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:54.920]   Is that something really want to leave your house and, you know, go into a crowd of people
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.920]   for?
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:00.400]   I mean, I think we'll be dealing with like the, the psychological reverberation, you know,
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.640]   reverberations of this for, I'm telling you, for a year.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.640]   PTSD.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.880]   We're going to be the, the, the COVID generation.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:13.640]   We're going to see, because yeah, we're like the depression, survivors who didn't want
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.680]   to spend a dime.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:18.280]   You know, we all know them or elders.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:23.560]   We're going to be, you know, our grandkids would say, why does grandpa wear a mask everywhere?
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.560]   It's very interesting.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.480]   I haven't been to a movie theater since it started or a concert.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.080]   Oh, no, I have been to concerts actually.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.080]   That's interesting.
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.240]   I, I, it's neither here nor there.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:41.760]   I just, when I was talking about Joe Rogan, I thought, well, I wonder what everybody thinks
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.680]   as we, I feel like the light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.680]   Is that reasonable?
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.520]   And it could be an oncoming.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:55.960]   Uh, yeah, I think it looked a lot of a lot of European countries that are winding down
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.520]   restrictions.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:02.320]   So there's that trucker thing in Canada, the guy's demand like that.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.720]   Uh, it feels like it is beginning.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.280]   Yeah, I think light at the end of the tunnel, uh, feels okay.
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.280]   But then who knows?
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.480]   My, my, my adopted mother is like, uh, has a PhD in biology.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.000]   She's like, you have no idea, like a snap of a finger that could be another variant that's
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.560]   like there could be one.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.560]   Oh, what?
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.560]   There could be.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.560]   Yeah, we have.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.560]   Absolutely.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:24.560]   We don't know.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.360]   And I think to your point of the, the psychological, it's the uncertainty and the constant yo-yoing
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.360]   back and forth.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.360]   Oh, it's over.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.360]   Oh, it's not.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:31.360]   Oh, that's just, we're done.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.280]   I've been lucky enough to be working from home.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.880]   It's, it is a real blow psychologically.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.880]   I think we're done.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.000]   Can someone explain to me the trucker protest because aren't proctors like alone in the
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.520]   cab?
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.720]   How are they affected?
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:53.280]   Uh, did you see that, uh, they, they raised, it turned out it really was out of the US.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:25:01.080]   And, uh, and a lot of the money raised and go fund me was, uh, was, uh, really political
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.240]   fundraising in effect.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:06.400]   Go fund me is actually frozen.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:16.720]   Almost $10 million, um, saying, you know, uh, this is Fox news even says promoted Capitol
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.520]   Hill occupied protest appeal.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.680]   I don't know what that means.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:26.320]   Uh, Danny, are you doing any reporting on the, uh, on the Canadian trucker protest?
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320]   None.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.320]   None.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:31.720]   Uh, a lot of Trump flags in the group.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.880]   I don't think they can vote for Trump in Canada.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.080]   I might be wrong.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.760]   The other thing I was going to add is that the, I was, I'm not obviously not doing any
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.520]   reporting on a Canadian trucker protest, but, uh, the go fund me shut down reminded me of,
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.160]   I'm sure you remember Leo and Owen too.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.400]   Uh, I'm probably, you too.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.560]   Uh, WikiLeaks way back in the day.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:55.080]   Uh, I guess it was like 2010, uh, when, when like PayPal and Visa shut them down.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:58.280]   Uh, and then they started asking for donations in Bitcoin.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:02.680]   Uh, and it's just the idea of, of, of, you know, not, not casting any sort of judgment
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:08.520]   on this protest, but that the idea of like, uh, a fundraising, uh, scheme being shut down
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:13.800]   by a centralized authority was like one of the great like selling points of crypto back
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.480]   of the day is like, ah, this, this wraps around that damage.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.400]   You don't even have to deal with centralized authorities anymore.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.520]   So that's, that's really what this thing reminded me of more than anything else.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.520]   Uh, okay.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.520]   I don't know.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.240]   I don't really know much.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.400]   It's interesting how little we know.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.560]   If you lived in Ottawa, you would know you would care.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.720]   It would be a big deal for you.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:38.440]   This, you know, the freedom convoy is overwhelming Ottawa apparently, but I think it's mostly
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.240]   American truckers, which is one reason probably Canadians aren't real thrilled by the whole
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.240]   thing.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:55.000]   Um, how about, how about this article from a guy named Owen Thomas, still in protocol,
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.960]   Silicon Valley loves Mafias and you should too.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.960]   What's that?
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:02.960]   What's that?
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.160]   What's your premise here, Mr. Thomas?
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:11.760]   So there was a, this guy named Ryan Bress, now who co-founded a, uh, a payment startup
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:17.080]   called Bolt and he went on Twitter to say that, uh, Stripe, you know, which is kind
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:23.320]   of the, you know, the big, you know, up and coming player in payment processing and Y
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.200]   Combinator, which is a startup accelerator that helped Stripe get it started.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:33.680]   We're acting like mob bosses and, you know, that, that they had actively, you know, tried
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:37.200]   to, tried to prevent his business from getting off the ground.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:43.360]   You could not attack two more beloved entities in Silicon Valley than Stripe and Y Combinator.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.560]   I mean, if any, if anybody's beloved in Silicon Valley, it's these two companies.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:56.080]   Y Combinator is a, I should mention is a kind of a startup camp where you can go.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.160]   You get a little bit of investment.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.080]   You get a lot of education, a lot of learning, a lot of companies have come out of Y Combinator.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.720]   And of course, as you mentioned, Stripe is the, is the leader in payments processing.
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:12.680]   Airbnb, Dropbox, you know, a lot of, you've heard of got there, but they're starting.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:18.320]   And Stripe is, you know, Stripe is well regarded because they made tools that are really easy
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:24.400]   for developers to integrate into, you know, their, I should, at this junction, mention
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.000]   that we use Stripe and we are, they are a sponsor.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   So okay, go ahead.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   Full disclosure.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   Full disclosure.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.360]   So it doesn't affect how we cover it, obviously, but yeah.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.400]   So I, I thought it was interesting.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.120]   Bressel was, was, you know, playing on this idea that there are these like networks in
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.960]   Silicon Valley, but they're often called mafias.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.240]   That's probably why you use the term mob bosses, you know, the PayPal mafia, but there's also
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:55.960]   a Facebook mafia, which just means a bunch of alumni from Facebook who went and started
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.640]   companies after they left Facebook.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.640]   And this is history, you point out that that's how Intel was started or if actually Fairchild
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.640]   was starting.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.280]   It's, I mean, the, you know, the whole history of Silicon Valley is groups of employees
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:11.960]   meeting at one company and leaving to start another.
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.400]   Now, you know, Breslow is saying, well, this, you know, this system got kind of broken
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.880]   because like he wanted to, you know, he wanted to bust in and start his company.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.640]   Well, both started three years after Stripe.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:31.400]   So, you know, his complaint is that Stripe had lined up all of the, you know, all of the
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.880]   great startup investors.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:38.680]   Well, it's considered really bad form if you're a venture capitalist to invest in a direct
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   competitor.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.880]   So they don't generally do that.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:45.560]   So I didn't really get what his complaint was there.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:52.080]   And then he also had like, you know, these other theories that, that hacker news, which
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:57.320]   is this website that Y Combinator operates, it's, you know, Reddit, like, you know, upvoting
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.400]   and downvoting links.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.240]   I live on hacker news.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:07.800]   You know, so he claimed that when Bolt had some announcement that his, you know, his
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:12.280]   announcement got downvoted and Stripe had a similar announcement that got upvoted.
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:18.400]   And the editor of Hacker News, you know, or moderator went on to explain, well, Bolt's
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:24.640]   post was very, you know, commercial and kind of, you know, advertiser, like, and people
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:25.880]   said to downvote that.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:33.000]   So this guy sounds, I would have just said, oh, he's just a whiny loser, except for the
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   fact that he's worth 11, the company's worth $11 billion, actually about to raise $14 billion.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.320]   I know it's like, if, you know, so if Stripe and Y Combinator are mob bosses, they are the
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.320]   most inept, mofiosis.
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.320]   It's not worth it.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.320]   We've ever met.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:54.600]   But I, you know, I, I did think it was an interesting, you know, an interesting discussion
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:59.880]   to be had about like these networks of people that kind of make Silicon Valley run.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.840]   And you know, are they always to the good?
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.960]   Something I didn't get into in the piece is that there is a problem with mofias, which
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.600]   is that, you know, they tend to perpetuate a lack of diversity.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:16.840]   Like if you have a group of mostly young white men at say PayPal and they go and start
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:22.560]   companies, they have a tendency to pull that same, not very diverse network with them.
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.760]   Now, it happens that, you know, at PayPal, there were actually a lot of women too, who
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.200]   went and started companies played key roles, became investors.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.760]   For some reason, they get ridden out of the history of the PayPal mafia.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.480]   Anyway, that's not their here and there.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:43.440]   But you know, I think there are critiques to be made of mofias, of alumni networks,
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.360]   of these connections, but Bresseli did not make them.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.680]   It's a story as old as time.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:52.240]   By the way, Breslow stepped down a CEO after this.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:57.640]   So the story that's old as time is one, people getting in trouble on Twitter.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:02.080]   Never, ever a good thing to get get spicy on Twitter.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.320]   But, but two, that's how it's always worked.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:10.740]   When I, when I was in college, I went to a prestige university because that's where
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:15.160]   you make the connections and the people who really wanted to be prestigious would join
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.560]   the secret society where you'd really make the connections.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.800]   But that's a hundred years old.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.320]   It's probably as old as humanity.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:28.500]   And it's fact, for a long time was the, the kind of the, the, the, the praises of San
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:34.080]   Francisco and Silicon Valley is, well, you know, that's where you're going to have these
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.200]   serendipitous interactions with other people who are working and you'll share information
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:41.020]   and that's the value of it.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.740]   I'd be hard to stop that.
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:45.660]   Yes, diversity would be nice.
[01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:47.940]   So maybe work on that.
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:50.980]   But then they, that's not part of the, that's not the critique he made.
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:54.740]   You know, he wanted to be part of this, you know, old boy.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:58.580]   I wanted to join, but they wouldn't let me.
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:03.780]   And you know, and, and again, like his company's been very successful.
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:09.560]   You know, it's just, it felt a little sour grapes and, um, you know, on the other hand,
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:11.720]   we're all talking about bolts now.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:16.320]   And it wasn't even, you know, it wasn't even on the radar before.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.320]   You know, it's good.
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.320]   Maybe he won.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:22.760]   You know, it's good marketing is to please your girlfriend by writing a word game and
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:25.760]   then selling it for seven figures to the New York Times.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.360]   That's good marketing.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.640]   I'm talking, of course, about wortle.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:34.340]   Um, I had to laugh though.
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:36.220]   Anderson Cooper wants to do it.
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:38.540]   He's a big wordle fan wants to do a story of wortle.
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:41.860]   Does he invite Patrick Wartle, the creator of wortle on to CNN?
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:47.820]   No, he invites Monica Lewinsky on to talk about how much she likes wortle.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:49.700]   And that's what's wrong.
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:57.300]   That's why I'm only going to watch CBS news.com/live from now on because you guys would never ever
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.900]   do that.
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:00.900]   Do you play wortle?
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:01.900]   Anybody?
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.600]   John, you playing it?
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:04.600]   All right.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.520]   None of these guys play wortle.
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:07.760]   Are you actively avoiding it?
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.280]   Have you never heard of it or?
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.000]   I'm actively avoiding it.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.280]   I saw people on Twitter talking about it and like, read lines for me.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.280]   He hates it.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.760]   He says all the people sharing their wortle on there has ruined.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.760]   I'm happy for them.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.120]   I hope they have a great day.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.120]   I'm not.
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.120]   It's stopped by the way.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.120]   It seems to have stopped.
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.120]   It doesn't.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:29.120]   It doesn't happen anymore.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:35.540]   I think Monica Lewinsky, by the way, has had this incredible second act.
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:44.580]   You know, I mean, you know, and good on her for like not letting what a man did to her
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.580]   define.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.580]   Oh, no, it's great.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.580]   I appreciate it.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.580]   It's great.
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:54.620]   It's just this is kind of unfortunately the celebrity mindset of, I guess, of CNN.
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:58.020]   I would invite the programmer on to talk about it.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.260]   Well, Jeff Sucker isn't there to make those decisions.
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:02.420]   No, no, no, he's gone.
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:08.060]   And apparently Lewinsky is writing for the Atlantic and wrote a story about wortle and
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:09.060]   the Atlantic.
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:12.620]   So that's the, see, there's a real natural tie in there.
[01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:17.220]   But I think that I think that the fact that the New York Times, you know, splashed out,
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:21.220]   I understand like what low seven figures they said seven figures.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:25.700]   I've got to figure it's low, which means a million bucks, but still good on Patrick,
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:26.700]   right?
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:35.060]   But I think that also tells you how, you know, like how important games are to the New York
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.060]   Times strategy.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:39.340]   And we're talking word games, crosswords, of course, as, you know, being kind of the
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:41.940]   iconic offering from the New York Times.
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:48.300]   But you know, it's just good to show you that, you know, just like pumping more URLs out into
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:55.140]   the internet is not necessarily the answer to, you know, to internet media's problems.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.740]   By the way, I want to correct myself.
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:00.900]   And if, if Anderson Cooper had invited Patrick Wardle on, he would have gotten the wrong
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:01.900]   guy.
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:02.900]   It's Josh Wardle.
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:07.500]   Patrick Wardle is also a programmer, well known from the Mac, the Mac world.
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:14.300]   Josh Wardle, who invented a wordle, he's a nice Welsh guy who invented it for his girlfriend
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.340]   during lockdown.
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:25.100]   And, and is now making some, some, well, low seven figure money for it, which is good.
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:26.100]   And it's smart.
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:29.100]   It's very smart in the New York Times to scoop that up.
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:30.100]   Right?
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:35.180]   Because you, you, they have word games already and you want that word of mouth.
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:38.140]   You want that attention, don't you?
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:43.180]   Speaking of bundled subscriptions that is the future of the time.
[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:45.420]   Times has done very well with that.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.420]   Very smart.
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.420]   Very well.
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:49.860]   Like, yeah, I pay for cooking crosswords.
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:54.940]   In fact, my biggest problem with the New York Times, I can't get them to stop sending, delivering
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:55.940]   the newspaper.
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.620]   I don't want the newspaper.
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.620]   Just want the other stuff.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:04.780]   And I can't figure out, maybe somebody could tell me, how do you subscribe to the digital
[01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:06.780]   only version of the New York Times?
[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:10.620]   You know, I've narrowed it down to just the Sunday times, but I don't want it.
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:14.420]   I can read it online two or three days ahead of time.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:20.060]   The Times also just recently bought the athletic at a sports website, which is amazing if you're
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:22.620]   into like sports writing, like in depth.
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:23.620]   It's, it's, I guess.
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:24.620]   It's really good.
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:26.620]   I've subscribed Brady's Facebook since day one.
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:27.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:28.620]   That's awesome.
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:33.900]   All right.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:37.580]   Let's talk about Apple.
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:45.300]   They have responded to Dutch regulators who said you've got to allow, for some reason,
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:50.260]   Dutch dating apps to have their own in-app purchases.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:57.300]   This is one of many places like South Korea, perhaps soon the US where Apple is being forced
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:03.060]   to give up their, their app store, their 30% VIG.
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:11.700]   So the Apple's response was, okay, okay, we'll, we'll give you your own app store and you'll
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:18.460]   only owe us 27% commission because we're not doing the payments processing anymore.
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:23.060]   And the response from the community is amazing.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:27.940]   Stephen Trott and Smith, who's Apple developer, uh, absolutely, this is on Twitter, absolutely
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:29.580]   vile.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:32.700]   His response, he says, this says everything about Tim Cook's Apple and what it thinks
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:33.700]   of developers.
[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:36.780]   I hope the company gets exactly what it deserves.
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:41.900]   Everybody on the executive team should be ashamed and some of them should not be here
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:43.900]   when it's all over.
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:55.060]   We all see you Marco Arment, who of course is a well-known developer and for, for iOS,
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:58.580]   his overcast is a very popular podcast player.
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:38:59.900]   He also worked at Tumblr.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:07.900]   He wrote, you can just feel how much Apple despises having to do any of this.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.420]   And by the way, if you're a developer, they've made it.
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:17.100]   So there's absolutely no way you're going to do this because once you pay the 3% to your
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:21.220]   credit card company and you still pay Apple 27% and there's a lot of hoops you have to
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:25.740]   jump through, you have to have a dedicated app just for it, special app.
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:28.980]   There's, you have to do all sorts of paperwork.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:38.740]   Um, it's just, I think it's fascinating that Apple is willing just to go balls to the wall.
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:39.740]   Excuse me.
[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:42.540]   Um, testicles to the wall for this.
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:46.860]   Like, dudes, you don't read the room.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:50.300]   This is not what people are talking about here.
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:57.340]   You know, I think, I think what it says is that the App Store Commission is only marginally
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:58.540]   about payments.
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:00.380]   It's about marketing.
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:02.380]   It's about marketing.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:03.660]   It's about distribution.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.780]   It's about, you know, discoverability in the App Store.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:14.820]   It's about the, you know, the SDK, all the tools that you get as a developer to build
[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.820]   your app.
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.820]   So you're defending Apple.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:18.060]   You think Apple's wrapped?
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:19.060]   Absolutely.
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:22.140]   I mean, you know, like, look, it's capitalism.
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:25.140]   Like this is, this is the cost of doing business.
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:27.820]   We created this beautiful platform.
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:32.380]   And if you, and we're going to do all the hard work, if you want to sell apps here, but
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:40.260]   you're going to give us 30%, which is less than, you know, uh, Ingram microcharged when
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:45.140]   I was selling, you know, when you were selling software in a box, they would take 50 or more
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:46.140]   percent.
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:48.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:52.860]   And actually in the Fortnite case, if I, if I recall the judge's decision correctly,
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:57.500]   they actually found that, you know, maybe there's a case to be made that Fortnite shouldn't
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:04.020]   have to use Apple's payment system, but that doesn't get Fortnite out of the 30% commission.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:09.940]   You know, so, so like, fine, go ahead, use a different payment system and you're going
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:12.020]   to have to pay Apple 30%.
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:16.300]   That was where, if I recall again, the, you know, the judge's decision correctly where
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:19.060]   that was, uh, where that was heading.
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:22.420]   Judge got overturned by the ninth district, by the way.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:26.660]   And they said, yeah, no, Apple, you don't have to do that.
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:29.740]   And, you know, it's, it is complicated.
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:35.740]   I mean, I think pulling apart the payments, you know, it is conceptually interesting to
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:41.300]   pull apart the payments processing part of things from distribution from marketing, but
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:46.300]   it's always been kind of a package deal that like, this is what you get for the 30%.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:52.900]   Now, it's 30% the right price for every app, for every market, for every situation, probably
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:53.900]   not.
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:58.660]   So when Apple's even admitted that, they offer 15% for some subscription services and so
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:41:59.660]   forth.
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:00.660]   Right.
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:03.060]   Like after the first year, you know, yeah.
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:06.460]   By the way, again, for the second time on this show, I have to apologize.
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:12.260]   I, uh, I, uh, inferred that the phrase balls, the wall had to do with male genitalia.
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:15.220]   In fact, it has to do with a game dodge ball.
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:20.020]   So just edit that all.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:21.020]   Go ahead.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:22.020]   I don't care.
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:24.060]   I'm humiliated.
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:26.540]   I'm going home.
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:32.420]   We're, we're just going to take a 30% 30.
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.820]   Take a third of that.
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:35.740]   Well, yeah, take a third of that.
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:36.740]   Please be my guest.
[01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:37.740]   Um, I don't know.
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:43.740]   I feel like Apple, uh, so there is a certain amount of rent seeking and what Apple's doing
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:48.740]   when they, when they say to Amazon, you kind of lap, you're going to give us 30% of books.
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.500]   You sell there or Netflix.
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:53.620]   You got to give us 30% of your subscriptions or Spotify.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:56.100]   Um, and yeah, they cut it to 15%.
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:58.740]   But, uh, that seems like rent seeking.
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:03.540]   They didn't, that's not why people subscribed to Netflix is because you, you made an iPhone
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:07.340]   or, or Spotify or buy books on Kindle because you made an iPhone.
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:12.180]   That's not Apple doesn't participate in that success and shouldn't.
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:18.460]   On the other hand, if, if you make a, a, a, a wordle on the iPhone and they're distributing
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:19.500]   it and they're promoting it.
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.860]   And yeah, maybe that's, maybe that should be 30%.
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:23.580]   That's not an unfair amount.
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:26.740]   So I don't know.
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:31.140]   It gets hard though to, you know, to make an exception here and an exception there.
[01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:33.900]   Like you want, you want to have consistent rules.
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:37.740]   And I think that's where, that's where Apple, besides the rent seeking, which I think is
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:39.220]   absolutely a fair critique.
[01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:45.740]   I think I think also wants to have a level, you know, a consistent approach.
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:46.740]   Yeah.
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:51.940]   Consistency though has been the challenge I've spoken with, with big developers like Facebook
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:58.140]   and Amazon, but I've also spoken with very small developers, including a, a review site.
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:05.060]   They reviewed, uh, iOS indie games and their contention is they used the term rent seeking
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:09.460]   and that they were essentially put out of business.
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:15.100]   And they, they argued that the Apple is not evenly applying their, their rules and that
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:21.940]   they would go after, um, companies that appeared to mimic or do some things that Apple did,
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:22.940]   but better.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:29.260]   And that's maybe that's, that's, they were a little resentful, but I can understand how
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:35.180]   maybe the rules weren't evenly applied and that that has generated some pretty ill will.
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:42.740]   And, and the pandemic made some things weird because you had, uh, you know, like Airbnb
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:47.740]   had these, these things called experiences, like you go, you know, you go stay in an Airbnb
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:49.940]   and you take a pottery class.
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:55.340]   Well, Airbnb figured, oh, like, okay, well now people aren't saying there, but the potter
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:57.220]   still wants to have students.
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:00.580]   So we'll sell a, you know, a zoom pottery class.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:05.900]   All of a sudden Apple is saying that's a virtual experience and are in a purchasing applies
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:06.900]   to that.
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:13.060]   Uh, whereas, you know, like they didn't charge 30% on the Airbnb stay or the, you know, or
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:14.700]   the pottery class before.
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:15.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.700]   Let's take a little break.
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:20.700]   I'm going to charge you all 30% for this next commercial.
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:23.580]   I hope you don't mind the bill is in the mail.
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:27.420]   I wonder by the way, what the Dutch regulators are going to do with, because Apple's clearly
[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:31.260]   like going, yeah, okay, well, yeah, how do you like this?
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:35.540]   I have a feeling that the, the, the Dutch regulators might have something to say about
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:36.540]   it.
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:40.540]   So carefully, our show today brought to you by our crowd.
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:46.860]   This is a really interesting idea for people who, you know, and I want to emphasize this,
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:49.380]   you know, you're, you're saving up for retirement.
[01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:53.220]   You're doing all the right things, but maybe you want to, you kind of watch in all this
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:55.820]   excitement happen in Silicon Valley, all this money being made.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:00.260]   You say, I kind of like to participate in this exciting world of startups.
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:02.100]   Here's the problem.
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:04.900]   Uh, you're not getting the information.
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.580]   You're not getting access to these companies at the right time.
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:11.980]   Once they go public, once you, yeah, you can buy stock, but, but that's already after
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:12.980]   the exit.
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:18.500]   What you want to do is get in as the big investors do on the ground floor at the beginning so
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:21.300]   that when the exit comes, you can, you can benefit from that.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:22.540]   And that's what our crowd does.
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:27.580]   Our crowd is a venture capital firm that has what we call deal flow.
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:34.140]   They, they know about what's going on in those little startup garages around the world.
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:39.700]   They analyze companies, look at the ones with the greatest growth potential and then let
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:46.900]   you get involved from personalized medicine to cybersecurity to proton therapy.
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:52.460]   This something new, a $20 billion total addressable market in state of the art labs and startup
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:57.500]   garages and everywhere in between our crowd is an identifying innovator so you can invest
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:01.500]   when the growth potential is the greatest at the beginning.
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.860]   And it works.
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:07.420]   Our crowd accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars in growing
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:08.820]   tech companies.
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:13.500]   Twenty one of their portfolio companies are unicorns.
[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:18.620]   Many of our crowd's members have benefited from over 40 IPOs or sale exits of portfolio
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:19.620]   companies.
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:23.660]   It is the fastest growing venture capital investment community.
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:25.700]   Let me explain a little bit about how it works.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:31.820]   When you go to our crowd.com/twit and please go there so they know you saw it here.
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:36.060]   You'll tell them what country you're in and there are rules in every country in the US
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:40.500]   they call it an accredited investor, a certain amount of net worth, certain amount of experience.
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:44.260]   They don't want you to be betting the rep money here.
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:48.620]   But if you're an accredited investor, you can, and again, depends on which country you're
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:49.900]   in, what those rules are.
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:51.140]   So go there and sign up.
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:55.220]   It's free to sign up by the way and get deal flow and find out what's going on.
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:56.940]   It costs you nothing.
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:00.260]   But once you see something you like, you can get in a single company deal for as little
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:06.260]   as $10,000 or not talking millions of dollars, just $10,000 or get into one of their funds
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:08.100]   for $50,000.
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:12.380]   But there isn't, and now you should know, there's a minimum of $10,000 required to invest.
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:14.780]   But those terms again may vary depending on where you invest.
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:19.160]   So when you go to the site and put the country you're investing from, I'll give you an example
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:23.580]   though of some of the early stage startups you can get involved in.
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:29.140]   And now you can invest in something called HIL Applied Medical.
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:33.100]   They're using Nobel Prize winning technology to bring the most advanced radiotherapy treatment
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:35.100]   to cancer patients.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:39.420]   It's the world's first laser based system that's earned them an agreement with Proton
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:44.540]   International, the largest proton therapy operator in the US and Europe.
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:46.140]   Oh, interesting.
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:50.580]   So they're already kind of getting into gear, HIL Applied Medical.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:52.660]   But find out more.
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:49:00.980]   You can invest in that or many other portfolio companies at OURCROWD.com/twit.
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:05.460]   But it costs you nothing to join to find out more, to read the prospectuses, to read the
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:08.300]   information, to follow what our crowd is doing.
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:09.300]   It's really fascinating.

[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:16.300]   I'm not an investor, but I find it fascinating to read up on this stuff.
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:21.860]   And I think it's a really good idea to give people access to stuff that normally, only
[01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:25.300]   people down there on Sand Hill Road get access to.

[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:41.300]   Let's see.
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:47.060]   Tesla's going to recall a whole bunch of cars because it turns out, to me, this is a
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:49.820]   great story.
[01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:55.020]   They even said this when they talked about full self-driving, that it would run some stop
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:56.020]   signs.
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:59.060]   Well, now technically that's illegal.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:01.300]   We call it here at California Stop in California.
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:04.500]   I don't know what you call it in the Hudson River Valley, but it's called a California
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:06.260]   Stop here.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:14.940]   And the way Tesla did it is, I think, I understand how the engineers were thinking.
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:17.980]   The Tesla says, "looks at the intersection.
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:18.980]   There's nobody there.
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:20.300]   You do, right?"
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:27.140]   And instead of coming to an energy inefficient full stop and start, it says, "I'm going to
[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:33.940]   go through at up to 5.6 miles an hour, 9 kilometers per hour."
[01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:35.900]   So okay, here's the bad news.
[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:37.500]   It's against the law.
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:42.580]   But I also understand exactly why Tesla did it.
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:45.940]   Now you're a consumer reporter, Nicholas.
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:49.900]   Oh boy.
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:53.420]   Well, I will preface this, but I don't know a ton about cars.
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:54.420]   So we'll say that.
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:58.900]   I'm not actually involved in the car team at two reports, but I would say I'm in favor
[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:01.540]   of laws and following them.
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:05.020]   Like you said, I could see the engineering mind being like, "Well, technically this is
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.860]   more efficient."
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:10.580]   Sure, but there are rules of the road for reason.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:14.420]   So I actually don't know how I feel about this.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:19.620]   The Governor's Highway Safety Association says this is not aware of any state where a
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:21.220]   rolling stop is legal.
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:24.020]   But I bet you in Montana, come on now.
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:25.020]   Come on, man.
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:26.020]   You get to an intersection.
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:27.660]   You're in the middle of nowhere.
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:29.900]   You can hear the tumbleweeds blowing.
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.980]   There's nobody in sight for miles.
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:34.220]   You're not going to stop at that stop sign.
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:39.460]   You might slow down like the Tesla would, but you're not going to stop.
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:43.180]   Maybe I'm like a very, like, I stop at stop signs.
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.540]   I'm fairly rural here.
[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:45.540]   I stop at stop signs.
[01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.100]   Do you come with a link?
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.100]   I do, actually.
[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:50.700]   And I blink when there's literally no, but I'm turning right.
[01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:51.700]   I put my blinker on.
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:52.700]   I don't know if I'm just doing--
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:53.700]   You're a good boy.
[01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:54.700]   You're a good boy.
[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:55.940]   I'm a goody two shoes in the road.
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:56.940]   I don't know.
[01:51:56.940 --> 01:52:03.580]   Tesla will have to recall a whole, I think it was something like 58,000 vehicles.
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:08.500]   There will be a over the air software update to turn this off.
[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.020]   Tesla agreed to the recall after two.
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:15.660]   Not one, but two meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:20.180]   Tesla did say, well, there haven't been any-- we don't know of any crashes or injuries
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:22.020]   caused by this feature.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:26.580]   Model S sedans and SUVs from 2016 through 2022.
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:29.460]   Model threes from 2017 to 2022.
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:31.420]   Model Ys 20 through 2022.
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:32.980]   I think it's almost everything.
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:36.580]   Everything that was capable of it.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:42.860]   The firmware update will go out in early February, which makes me wonder why they have to do
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:43.860]   the recall.
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:46.700]   Maybe that's what's going to fix it.
[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:51.100]   I was going to ask, what does a recall even mean in the age of--
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.180]   If you could software update, right?
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:56.780]   I mean, like, fix the software probably.
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:02.940]   It doesn't excuse Tesla for allowing this to get out there in the first place.
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:11.780]   But I do wonder if we have to rethink the whole system of recalls, because that's an
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:18.780]   enormous amount of expense to get the cars back to a service center.
[01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:22.780]   And for what, for an over the air update that you can get with the car just sitting in the
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:23.780]   garage?
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:24.780]   Yeah.
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:27.260]   I wonder if it's just-- I mean, this is totally speculation.
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:32.580]   But I wonder if using that language, recall is just smart PR.
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.180]   It's language that we all understand.
[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:35.660]   Yeah, because it's really not--
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:38.100]   Yeah, not-- yeah.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:39.100]   They say recall.
[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:41.220]   And maybe that's also that maybe the legal term.
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.220]   I don't know.
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:44.300]   Yeah, yeah, right.
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:49.340]   But it's-- Recall documents posted Tuesday by US safety regulators.
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:51.220]   I'm reading from the AP.
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:56.580]   Say that Tesla will disable the feature with an over the internet software update by sometime
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:59.100]   this month.
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:03.100]   Now I had read it was two kilometers, but it says 5.6 miles an hour.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:06.300]   So it is pretty fast going through there.
[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:10.220]   And AP interviewed a professor at Carnegie Mellon.
[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:13.140]   He's a professor of electrical and computer engineering.
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:16.620]   He said, "Four-way stop signs are commonly placed."
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:18.540]   We have them all over in California.
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:23.940]   "Commonly placed to protect intersections for kids when no crossing guard is present."
[01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:28.300]   He said, "Tesla's machine learning system can mistakenly identify objects.
[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:33.500]   What happens when FSD decides a child crossing the streets not relevant and fails to stop?
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:37.780]   This is an unsafe behavior and should never been put in vehicles."
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:39.580]   I guess I agree.
[01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:42.180]   I do not do-- by the way, I do not do rolling stops.
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:47.100]   I have family members who do.
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:48.660]   But I like to stop.
[01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:49.940]   You know, it's a token stop.
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:53.500]   I don't like-- I don't like sit there for a second.
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:55.500]   But I come to a full stop.
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:56.500]   Right?
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.140]   And I look around.
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:54:59.740]   You should do the same.
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:03.540]   Otherwise, get your firmware updated.
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:08.260]   So wow.
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:11.420]   Has anybody purchased any board APs?
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:12.420]   Wow.
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:13.420]   No.
[01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:21.620]   You know, when-- around the time I started at Protocol, we actually had to come up with
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:24.740]   a policy around NFC.
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:33.220]   And we had a policy around cryptocurrency and whether you could hold it and disclosures
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:35.180]   that were needed.
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:38.940]   But we struggled to figure out with NFTs.
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:46.340]   If you have an NFT, does that give you a financial motivation to promote that group
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:49.180]   of NFTs or like the general--
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:51.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:56:01.500]   Or if it's really unique, then it's just your-- it's just owning a piece of art doesn't
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:06.100]   give you a motive to pump the whole art world.
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:11.740]   You just think that your piece of art is nice and worth whatever you paid for it.
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:14.700]   Well, tell that to Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:18.860]   This clip on Twitter from a recent tonight show.
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:19.860]   I know.
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:21.300]   I'm so happy I taught you what they were.
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:22.300]   You did.
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:23.300]   You taught me what's happened.
[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:24.300]   And then I bought an AP?
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:27.900]   I got an AP too because I saw you on the show with people and you said you got a moon
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:28.900]   pay.
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:30.540]   So I went and I copied you and did the same thing.
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:31.540]   You did?
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:32.540]   Mm-hmm.
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:33.540]   And they--
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:34.540]   This is your AP.
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:35.540]   But we gave you a very cool--
[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:36.540]   That's Paris paid--
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.540]   Paris paid--
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:38.540]   Are you ready?
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:39.540]   300--
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:40.540]   How did you pay--
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:42.020]   $1,000 for that board AP?
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:49.820]   Jimmy Fallon's board AP, apparently $216,000 because what you do is you go to the top.
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:52.220]   You go back through the blockchain.
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:57.380]   And at the same time as he said, I bought one, there was this transaction for the AP that
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:56:59.060]   you know he has.
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:01.300]   So that's half a million dollars on--
[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:06.380]   By the way, you don't get the one and only copy of this art.
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:07.380]   What do you get?
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:10.380]   You could say I own it and you get a URL.
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:12.700]   And that's it.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.100]   It is, I think, if you're going to--
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:17.740]   I mean, maybe I'm cynical.
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:22.820]   But if you're going to spend $216,000 on that, it's not because you love it so much
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:23.820]   that it's--
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:28.700]   Or that you're so infinitely rich that it's like small change, it's that you hope to sell
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:32.700]   it on to somebody else for $316,000, right?
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:33.700]   It's an investment.
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:34.700]   It's speculation.
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:36.860]   So then, to go on a tonight--
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:40.940]   By the way, 7 million people have seen that clip on Twitter alone.
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:46.700]   I don't know how many millions have seen it on the tonight show and say, look, look,
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:50.380]   it sounds vaguely unethical.
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:52.500]   Am I wrong?
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:55.180]   See, to me, it's--
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:56.180]   Now, I don't know.
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:58:00.300]   Anybody wants to defend NFTs, please do, or Bitcoin or crypto or Web3.
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:06.820]   But I am increasingly of the opinion and it's all a scam.
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:08.060]   I think it's--
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:09.060]   You should disclose.
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:10.060]   I mean, I--
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:13.260]   Well, they said they owned it.
[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:15.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:21.140]   Speaking of, I do work for my organization, so I'm promoting my organization.
[01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:22.140]   That's true.
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:25.860]   I'm publishing a story tomorrow morning, interview--
[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:31.500]   Short story, but an interview with Timo Riley, a famous publisher and technologist.
[01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:33.260]   He coined the phrase Web 2.0.
[01:58:33.260 --> 01:58:36.860]   I think Tim had the first-- or one of the first commercial websites.
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:41.900]   And he uses really strong language about NFTs and crypto.
[01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:43.580]   We have some video that we'll publish.
[01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:48.740]   But he's-- I don't know if he uses the word scam.
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:49.740]   Wow.
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:54.500]   But he references the trading back and forth of NFTs, which is pretty common to boost their
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:55.500]   value.
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:00.180]   And he does call it a pyramid scheme or that it's like a pyramid scheme.
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:06.180]   He was pretty OK with the technology, the underlying--
[01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:07.740]   The blockchain, fast-evident.
[01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:08.740]   Right.
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:13.300]   But the use of it-- I mean, look, O'Reilly knows his stuff.
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:14.500]   And he's a trusted person.
[01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:17.540]   He has-- I think he has a blockchain conference.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:19.060]   So he has a lot of conferences.
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.060]   He has a lot of conferences.
[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:21.220]   I think he had a blockchain conference.
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:23.100]   So he's not against block.
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:24.100]   He's not a fool.
[01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:26.100]   But he's not a-- no, he's not a fool.
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:27.700]   I think I really liked him a lot.
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:30.340]   I don't think he's against crypto or NFTs.
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:37.860]   I think he is smartly pointing out the behavior around these products.
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:41.740]   I don't know that I would call an NFT or cryptocurrency, actually, technology.
[01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:46.820]   These are products that come from blockchain technology, but that these products have
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:49.500]   pretty scam-like behavior around them.
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:54.860]   And if you go to the very top of-- well, I won't get into the pyramid scheme stuff.
[01:59:54.860 --> 02:00:02.340]   But it really-- some of the behavior seems to be pretty similar to it.
[02:00:02.340 --> 02:00:08.100]   It did strike me that a lot of people who were buying NFTs early on were people who
[02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:11.340]   were very heavily invested in crypto.
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:18.380]   Now, if you convert your crypto to fiat currency, that generates a transaction that
[02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:23.380]   may or may not get reported to the IRS, but the IRS is definitely going to be interested.
[02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:30.940]   When you convert your crypto to an NFT, not as clear to me that there is a taxable transaction
[02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:36.180]   that at least that the IRS can kind of pin down.
[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:46.180]   But I kind of wonder if there is some of that motivation of this is basically a way we can
[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:56.260]   get our value out of crypto and out of a fungible cryptocurrency and into this non-fungible token.
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:01:02.660]   There's also a ton of wash trading, basically meaning trading like for like, which when
[02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:06.220]   it happens with stocks, stocks is pretty suspect.
[02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:11.220]   So I think we have to look at that pretty carefully in the NFT market.
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:16.900]   Well, and as Dan pointed out, there's evidence now that people are buying their own NFTs to
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:20.580]   get the price up to kind of stimulate some interest in the NFTs.
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:23.460]   I think Fortune Magazine published a story.
[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:24.700]   It's not my reporting.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:27.060]   It's I think Fortune's.
[02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:36.060]   BuzzFeed has discovered the guys behind the board chimps, the B.A.Y.C., the board apes
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:38.060]   Yacht Club.
[02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:40.060]   And it's interesting.
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:43.060]   They've attempted to be pretty anonymous, although they've now confirmed that that is,
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:45.660]   in fact, they are, in fact, the creators of this.
[02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:52.620]   A couple of liberal arts majors, writers, journalists, and they lived in Florida and they
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:54.060]   thought, you know, we should do this.
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:56.620]   They're not even the artist, by the way.
[02:01:56.620 --> 02:02:01.860]   They thought, eh, they were both in their 30s, met while growing up in Florida, according
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:05.620]   to BuzzFeed, and both had literary aspirations.
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:09.460]   They both were interested in crypto, wanted to create some sort of NFT collection, came
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:14.740]   up with a concept of rich apes living in a swamp clubhouse.
[02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:19.580]   So they hired a freelance illustrator to draw them, partnered with two engineers as co-founders
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:22.860]   to execute the collection, and they've been selling them.
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:27.860]   They have, this is actually, this is where you get the profit is, they make money not
[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:31.820]   just from the initial sale, because remember, they didn't sell it direct to Jimmy Fallon
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:35.380]   or to Paris Hilton, probably somebody bought it and sold it and bought it and sold it and
[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:36.620]   they eventually got to them.
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:42.380]   They made $2 million from the initial sales of the NFTs, but they get a 2.5% royalty in
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:43.620]   all future trades.
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:47.860]   So every time that NFT is sold, they get 2.5%.
[02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:51.540]   So there is some money in this.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:54.580]   I don't think there are scammers necessarily.
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:03:00.300]   I don't think anybody is a scammer in this exactly, but I think you should consider the
[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:07.460]   source when you hear people pumping up the notions of NFTs or crypto or Web3, because
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:10.980]   they may have invested interest in pumping it.
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:11.980]   Go ahead.
[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:18.420]   The whole point is we did not know who these two co-founders of Board Apiat club even were
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:19.580]   until Katie Tops.
[02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:20.580]   They were not.
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:21.580]   Yeah.
[02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:26.900]   Did that great reporting in BuzzFeed to uncover their identities.
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:29.140]   And she's gotten tons of criticism.
[02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:30.500]   People are saying it's doxing.
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:31.940]   She's doxing the board.
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:32.940]   It's interesting.
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:33.940]   Yeah.
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:34.940]   I mean, it's just reporting.
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:35.940]   Yeah.
[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:36.940]   But...
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:42.780]   No, and it's appropriate because for accountability reasons, I think people shouldn't know who this
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:43.780]   is.
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:46.780]   It's doing this.
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:50.780]   There is in the cryptoculture this kind of...
[02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:56.580]   Sort of like in the gaming world, this idea that you have pseudonyms and that you have
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:59.140]   semi-form of anonymity.
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:00.140]   Yeah.
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:01.140]   Right.
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:02.900]   I mean, well, that's the whole point of black china, isn't it?
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:08.300]   Is that there's no central authority and everything's recorded in the blockchain, but
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:09.780]   it's not recorded with your real name.
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:15.060]   It's recorded with your account number or your pseudonym or whatever it is you're using
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:17.780]   to identify your holdings.
[02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:24.140]   But someone who actually used the blockchain to discover that big crypto project was being
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:26.980]   run by someone who had been involved in a previous scam.
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:27.980]   Yeah.
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:31.140]   And they did all of that through blockchain analysis.
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:36.460]   Well, and that's how the people like Mark Cuban defended in Katie's article saying, "Well,
[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:38.860]   look, this is all out in the public because it's in the blockchain.
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:42.860]   Everybody can inspect the blockchain and you don't have to know their real name.
[02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:45.060]   You know their blockchain reputation."
[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:49.060]   It's an interesting point.
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:54.860]   Here's what Tim said, just a short quote.
[02:04:54.860 --> 02:04:58.740]   When I hear a lot of people say, "Oh, there's so much money going into this, it must be
[02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:01.100]   valuable and therefore it's going to be successful."
[02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:05.140]   I actually have the opposite reaction when there's so much money going into it.
[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:10.340]   And then he quotes the famous Uptonson Claire line, "It's hard to convince a man of something
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:12.140]   when he's invested in it."
[02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:13.140]   I'm paraphrasing there.
[02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:15.660]   But we'll post the whole video tomorrow.
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:23.060]   His point was him seeing the first web bubble come and go, the technology, the underlying
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:27.500]   framework of the internet, of course, was technologically sound.
[02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:35.060]   But the products that were built on top of it had so much fud around them or so much hype
[02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:39.220]   around them that it caused this bubble.
[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:41.860]   And a lot of people got hurt in that bubble.
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:46.180]   And that's the underlying thing of what Tim is saying is that the tech is one thing, the
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:50.780]   hype is another thing and that if this bubble pops, people could get hurt.
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:51.780]   Yeah.
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:52.780]   I can't wait.
[02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:56.420]   I will listen to that or watch that story tomorrow.
[02:05:56.420 --> 02:05:57.420]   That sounds really cool.
[02:05:57.420 --> 02:06:00.100]   Yeah, I look forward to reading that, Dan, because that's sort of like, "Jods with my,"
[02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:03.860]   like the tech is very interesting as, you know, people here.
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:05.620]   It feels a little hypey.
[02:06:05.620 --> 02:06:10.100]   It feels a little, if Paris Hilton is on Jimmy Fallon, like, "Look at this."
[02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:14.100]   Like that, my spidey sense is tingling a little bit there.
[02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:18.100]   But I will say it's also interesting to see companies continue to like experiment with
[02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:21.780]   UFC just launched a bunch of NFTs last week or two weeks ago.
[02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:24.500]   They're very similar to the NBA Top Shot stuff.
[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:25.500]   Top Shot.
[02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:30.500]   But on the other hand, EA said, again, a week or two ago that blockchains are not something
[02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:32.180]   they're actively pursuing.
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:34.660]   You know, after the previous quarter, they said they were pursuing.
[02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:39.780]   I would like to like just fast-forward like maybe five years to see where all this NFTs.
[02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:41.260]   Is this just flavor of the month?
[02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:45.580]   Just like every marketer at an org is like, "We got to get involved in NFTs because the
[02:06:45.580 --> 02:06:47.180]   kids are into it."
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:49.300]   And it just ends up being nothing.
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:54.740]   It feels, again, the tech is super cool to me, but it feels like this particular implement.
[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:59.660]   I'm super not impressed with like eight pictures on Twitter, like I'm sorry, like that's not
[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:01.180]   like I don't know.
[02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:05.100]   Even you have the octagonal, like, "Oh, because you pay for Twitter, Blue."
[02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:06.100]   What?
[02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:09.100]   I just made it an octagonal profile, but yeah.
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:10.100]   Exactly.
[02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:11.820]   You can use it, and that's fine.
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:17.180]   But on the other hand, if people get, if it like does something for them and they feel
[02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:21.140]   cool by having that, I also have no problem with that either.
[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:28.020]   But it does feel a little hypey and a little weird, I guess, as it currently exists.
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:34.340]   Reed Max, Max Reed is his name, Reed Max is his sub-stack, actually did a little digging,
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:35.980]   and it's kind of interesting.
[02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:41.740]   The interrelationships Jimmy Fallon is represented by CAA, which is by the way an investor in
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:47.700]   OpenSea, which is the number one NFT marketplace, and also is representing NFT collector,
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:53.940]   ZeroXP1, who owns NFTs from the board A/PYOT club, and another CAA client, Ashton Kutcher,
[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:58.020]   also an investor in OpenSea.
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:03.420]   Kutcher is starring in a Netflix movie with Reese Witherspoon, who owns the world of
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:07.860]   women NFTs, who opens to be married to a CAA agent.
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:09.900]   I think it can get a little bit crazy.
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:15.100]   In fact, he's got one of those crazy maps that you tie the strings from here to there
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:16.540]   and everything like that.
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:21.100]   And I'm sure it's a little tongue-in-cheek, but it is kind of interesting how this, and
[02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:25.020]   I have, you know, these things happen in Hollywood and elsewhere in other communities, where
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:29.620]   they, these trends burn through and everybody's, "Oh, I got to get one, I got to get one."
[02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:36.780]   And just, you know, I feel like maybe people should be cautious.
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:37.780]   That's all.
[02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:40.780]   Just, if it's money, you don't need, go ahead.
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:46.620]   But there seems like there might be other things you could do that would be more useful.
[02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:55.420]   Boy, I'm wondering what Google's intentions are with Stadia.
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:58.700]   It seems like it's slowly winding down.
[02:08:58.700 --> 02:09:04.700]   While everybody else with their streaming gaming systems is just getting started, Stadia
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:11.860]   has apparently killed their white label version.
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:12.860]   Businesses.
[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:13.860]   How about the business?
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:20.180]   Well, it wasn't initially, but then they pivoted.
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:24.020]   Anyway, just another buyer beware, I guess.
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:25.020]   And speaking of buyers...
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:29.180]   Why does Google need to be in all of these lines of business?
[02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:30.180]   I mean...
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:31.180]   Yeah, maybe not.
[02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:39.500]   I mean, I think their mode of operation is, "We'll just try everything and kill it the
[02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:43.420]   minute it's not a good idea or not profitable."
[02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:47.780]   That gives us a better chance of finding the next big thing than a company like Apple,
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:52.780]   which is saying, "Well, let's spend $100 billion on self-driving vehicles and maybe that'll
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:53.780]   be the next big thing."
[02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:58.980]   I think Google's a little bit more like, "Let a thousand flowers bloom."
[02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:03.860]   But there's a downside to it, which is that people who use Google's services start to
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:08.100]   get a little worried that their favorite's going to disappear too.
[02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:12.180]   I think one of the issues with Stadia was always the specific business model.
[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:14.700]   It wasn't quite the Netflix of game.
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:15.700]   Compared to Game Pass.
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:16.700]   You had to buy the game.
[02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:17.700]   You had to buy the game.
[02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:21.340]   You had to buy the game so that it never actually made sense as a consumer.
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:22.780]   It was like, "Why would I do this?"
[02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:27.540]   Again, compared to Microsoft Game Pass, where I say, "Oh, that's just part of my $50
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:28.540]   month."
[02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:31.020]   It's a bundle, like I play on my phone or shoot on my laptop.
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:32.020]   That's cool.
[02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:34.180]   I've used Game Pass streaming.
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:35.180]   It works fine.
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:37.700]   I happen to have a decent internet connection.
[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:41.220]   That's the trick, if your internet is good enough or not.
[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:43.740]   But yeah, Stadia, I don't know.
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:48.420]   It had a weird, highly structured that always felt wrong, basically.
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:49.420]   Yeah.
[02:10:49.420 --> 02:10:50.420]   All right.
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:51.420]   Let's take a break.
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:53.420]   Then we'll wrap up with a few shorties.
[02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:54.420]   A little quickies.
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:55.420]   We've got a great panel.
[02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:57.380]   I'm so glad to have Dan Patterson here.
[02:10:57.380 --> 02:11:00.300]   cbsnews.com/live.
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:02.580]   We'll look for your interview with Tim tomorrow.
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:05.180]   I think Tim is a smart guy, really interesting.
[02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:08.540]   I can't wait to hear what he has to say about all of this.
[02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:14.580]   @Dan Patterson on the Twitter, "Do you have a special super secret drop for people who
[02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:16.940]   want to give you tips or anything like that?"
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:19.660]   No, just a product on mail or email.
[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:20.660]   Okay.
[02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:22.020]   There you go.
[02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:23.020]   That's all you need.
[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:26.900]   Oh, and Thomas, "From Protocol, senior editor over there doing great.
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:27.900]   Boy, I love Protocol.
[02:11:27.900 --> 02:11:29.820]   Give our regards to Meghan.
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:31.300]   Meghan Moroni's over there."
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:32.300]   Absolutely.
[02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:33.300]   Yeah.
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:34.660]   Anything you're working on you want to talk about?
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:43.100]   Actually, speaking of money, I have a disposition on the stock market dropping tomorrow in
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:44.580]   Protocol Source Code.
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:45.580]   Good.
[02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:46.580]   Can't wait.
[02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:49.100]   I'll try to make sense of it all.
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:52.220]   So you kind of have a newsletter?
[02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:54.140]   I do.
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:59.660]   My day job is senior editor of Protocol FinTech, which is now a daily newsletter.
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:03.180]   We're really excited about that five days a week.
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:08.860]   And occasionally they let me out of my cage and write for Source Code, which is the flagship
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:10.300]   newsletter over here.
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:11.300]   Nice.
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:12.300]   Very nice.
[02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:13.860]   I always enjoy your reading.
[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:14.860]   You're writing.
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:19.220]   I enjoy reading your writing, but not writing your reading because I don't write it.
[02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:20.220]   I hate writing.
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:25.780]   Also with us speaking of writers, he is the senior technology or electronics reporter
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:27.460]   for Consumer Reports.
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:29.980]   Nicholas de Leon, great to have you.
[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:30.980]   Nicholas.
[02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:31.980]   Thank you.
[02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:34.740]   Yeah, it's funny.
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:40.780]   I'm actually working on a crypto thing now for CR that should be published within the
[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:41.780]   month, maybe.
[02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:43.780]   It's kind of a tricky thing to do.
[02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:48.220]   If I may, if I could publish a side project, I have a podcast.
[02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:53.140]   We talk about wristwatch, a Seiko in Rolex News called The Hour Time Show.
[02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:54.140]   Just a fun thing.
[02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:58.700]   Give me something non-tech related during the week to opine about.
[02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:00.500]   So The Hour Time Show.
[02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:03.220]   Is it H-O-U-R or O-U-R?
[02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:04.220]   Yes.
[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:05.220]   H-O-R-L-R.
[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:08.620]   Like the hours of The Hour Time Show.
[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:10.420]   Ristwatch review.
[02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:13.540]   Yeah, it's a fun little side face.
[02:13:13.540 --> 02:13:15.420]   What are you sporting these days?
[02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:16.580]   What's on your wrist?
[02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:19.780]   I actually have on today, I just got this from my brother.
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:24.660]   I have an or, I am not quite in Rolex money quite yet, but this is an O-R-E-N's Bambino.
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:25.660]   Where's my camera?
[02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:27.300]   It's kind of a fun little wristwatch.
[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:29.260]   I love wristwatch.
[02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:35.580]   You know, it's sad because I only wear an Apple watch now because of, I don't know why.
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:36.940]   I love wristwatches.
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:39.540]   Kevin Rose, of course, bought H-O-Dinky.
[02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:46.700]   Yeah, no, I had a story in H-O-Dinky in December about how the Apple Watch was my gateway drug
[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:47.700]   so to speak.
[02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:49.100]   Oh, got you into it.
[02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:50.100]   I had no idea.
[02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:54.380]   I didn't know watches existed, frankly, until I got the Apple Watch and was using it.
[02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:58.860]   I was like, "Ah, it kind of like got the wheel, the gear spinning," or whatever.
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:02.260]   And so, yeah, I have the article in H-O-Dinky going into that.
[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:08.300]   So, yeah, I wear the Apple Watch nowadays mostly just for fitness stuff or cycling or
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:10.540]   working out or whatever.
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:16.420]   It is nice to not have the constant buzzing of messages and WhatsApp and all that stuff.
[02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:19.140]   Just the time is good enough for me.
[02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:24.460]   Kevin, I have so much more money than I do.
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:31.980]   So, he's wearing these most amazing, beautiful $100,000 wristwatches.
[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:32.820]   That's my problem with this.
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:33.820]   I love wristwatches.
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:35.420]   I think they're beautiful.
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:41.180]   But I'm more of a Timex guy than a tech-Philippe guy.
[02:14:41.180 --> 02:14:46.700]   But I wish I had, at the same time, the idea of having something worth $100,000 on your
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:48.620]   wrist, it just seems unconscionable to me.
[02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:50.260]   So, I don't know.
[02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:53.420]   I actually shouldn't say that that's how much Kevin's watches cost.
[02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:59.500]   But we did go to a dinner with him at the French Londay that was sponsored by some high-end
[02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:01.700]   Swiss watchmaker.
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:06.620]   And they had a guy there with little magnifying glasses on, a little hammer, and he was building
[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:08.780]   watches and filing stuff down.
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:10.260]   It was like wild.
[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:11.660]   Hand, these things are handmade.
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:12.660]   It's amazing.
[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:13.660]   Yeah.
[02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:17.420]   I had an editor in New York City about a decade ago who, you know, he would hold up a picture
[02:15:17.420 --> 02:15:18.900]   of the magazine in the back.
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:21.100]   There was invariably like a Rolex or a mega ad.
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:24.100]   And he was like, "Roll X pays for all of your salaries."
[02:15:24.100 --> 02:15:25.660]   And it was like a 25-year-old.
[02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:27.900]   I was like, "Oh, yeah, I guess I'm a rank and file.
[02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:28.980]   What do I know?"
[02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:31.980]   Those watch companies spend money.
[02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:32.980]   So very interesting.
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:33.980]   Big money.
[02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:34.980]   Big money.
[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:35.980]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:36.980]   Yeah.
[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:37.980]   Yeah.
[02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:38.980]   Interesting.
[02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:39.980]   Anyway.
[02:15:39.980 --> 02:15:40.980]   Someday.
[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:41.980]   But you know what?
[02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:42.980]   I can listen to the "Hour Time" show and I can get my watch fixed at that.
[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:48.900]   I have a-- Lisa gave me, and it's a beautiful Cartier Tank watch, which is a kind of very
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:51.060]   classic, beautiful watch.
[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:52.060]   Again.
[02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:55.300]   She always says, "Why aren't you wearing your tank watch?"
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:58.900]   She said, "Well, I can't--" I would look dopey to have two watches.
[02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:00.380]   That's a debate in the watch.
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:01.380]   Can you double risk?
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:02.380]   No.
[02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:03.380]   I swore scoffed it back of the day.
[02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:04.380]   If I'm not--
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:05.380]   Norman or Norman Swore?
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:06.380]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:07.380]   Norman Swore today.
[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:08.380]   Norman, wow.
[02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:09.820]   Double watched.
[02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:12.980]   He probably had one that was the Iran time, Iraq time, and--
[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:13.980]   I don't remember.
[02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:14.980]   --and the US time.
[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:15.980]   There's a couple photos of him.
[02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:19.740]   But that is a debate in the community because then it's like, "Okay, then I'll wear the Apple
[02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:22.300]   watch and then like a real watch."
[02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:27.100]   I've been thinking I could probably wear the Apple watch around my ankle.
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:28.580]   It would probably work.
[02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:30.900]   I haven't tried it.
[02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:32.420]   C.L. has it tested it, so I don't know.
[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:33.420]   Test it, would you?
[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:34.420]   I showed it.
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:37.100]   I brought to you by Nureva.
[02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:39.100]   Nureva.
[02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:42.140]   You've got the, you know, the huddle room, the conference room, the big one where you
[02:16:42.140 --> 02:16:43.660]   have people come in and stuff.
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:46.260]   And maybe you've looked at, "Well, how can we get the audio better?"
[02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:48.380]   You probably had the speakerphone on the table, right?
[02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:49.380]   That's terrible.
[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:50.380]   That's the best experience ever.
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:51.940]   How can we get the audio better?
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:59.980]   So maybe you went and you talked to, you know, big audio technical firm and, you know, they
[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:03.660]   said, "Well, you know, we've got to bring the designers in and we've got to spec it out,
[02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:04.660]   measure everything.
[02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:06.940]   We've got to do some echo testing and stuff like that.
[02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:11.300]   And then we've got to get the mics and they've got to put them on the table when you've
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:13.220]   got a tape of a mark where they are.
[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:17.580]   And oh, by the way, because of COVID protocols, you've got to sanitize in between meetings
[02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:21.380]   and there's going to be wires and there's speakers and we've got a technician in there
[02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:23.820]   every few weeks because he's got to calibrate it.
[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:25.940]   This is not what you want.
[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:33.060]   But I have a better solution, a leap in technology that has transformed conference rooms.
[02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:36.140]   It's called Noreva and you are EVA.
[02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:39.400]   It's as simple as a sound bar.
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:41.420]   You could install it yourself.
[02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:48.420]   No wires, no microphones, just their patented microphone mist technology.
[02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:53.180]   The microphones are in the sound bar, but they work so there are no dead zones.
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:57.780]   That it's as if there are thousands of microphones filling the room virtual microphones.
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:02.460]   You can hear everyone everywhere, no matter what way they're facing, no matter how their
[02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:04.020]   social distancing.
[02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:07.820]   You could just talk and move naturally and you'll be heard by everybody, the remote
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:09.700]   part tested participants.
[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:10.700]   It's amazing.
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:14.140]   It's got continuous auto calibration.
[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:17.580]   Your room is always ready to use with optimized audio.
[02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:19.380]   You don't need an outside technician.
[02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:20.540]   You can install it yourself.
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:22.860]   It's a 30 minute DIY job.
[02:18:22.860 --> 02:18:27.780]   If you can hang a sound bar, a couple of screws and boom, you can do Noreva, which you can
[02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:29.860]   save you a lot of time.
[02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:33.820]   If you have multiple rooms, you'll use the Noreva console, which is awesome, to manage
[02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:34.820]   the rooms.
[02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:39.780]   Gives your IT department the power to monitor, manage your adjust systems from anywhere.
[02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:41.540]   They don't even have to go to the room.
[02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:43.380]   They can just do it all from the console.
[02:18:43.380 --> 02:18:45.460]   Noreva is brilliant.
[02:18:45.460 --> 02:18:47.020]   It sounds great.
[02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:50.620]   It works, saves you thousands of dollars.
[02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:52.300]   It's simple.
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:53.300]   It's modern.
[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:57.580]   Ask yourself, you want to go with that costly, complicated traditional system, or do you
[02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:01.100]   want to make the leap to simple, economical Noreva?
[02:19:01.100 --> 02:19:03.700]   And you are EVA.com.
[02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:04.780]   Find out more.
[02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:06.820]   It really is a brilliant solution.
[02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:10.060]   And as we get back to work, as we start having those meetings, some people are remote, some
[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:14.060]   people are in office, you're going to really want to have this in your conference room.
[02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:18.620]   Noreva.com and you are EVA.com.
[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:21.500]   We had a great week on Twitch.
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:25.460]   We have prepared a small mini movie for your enjoyment.
[02:19:25.460 --> 02:19:30.780]   We don't actually know if the Pixel 6 is their best selling Pixel device yet.
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:31.780]   It's too heavy.
[02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:32.780]   It's too premium.
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.780]   This is premium.
[02:19:33.780 --> 02:19:34.780]   It's too heavy.
[02:19:34.780 --> 02:19:40.060]   It's too heavy for my delicate floppy wrist.
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:43.620]   Just damage me forever.
[02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:45.460]   I'm not the grumpy one today.
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:46.460]   Two of you.
[02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:47.460]   You're crazy.
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:48.460]   Wow.
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:50.460]   Is that grumpy?
[02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:54.100]   Previously on Twitch, Tech News Weekly.
[02:19:54.100 --> 02:19:55.980]   There's the real estate market.
[02:19:55.980 --> 02:19:58.860]   And then there's the virtual real estate market.
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:01.460]   And I played this basically in Monopoly game.
[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:06.540]   But so instead of using a traditional game board, they use maps of real cities where
[02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:08.620]   you can then buy and trade.
[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:10.060]   I just put in my own address.
[02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:16.100]   It turns out that somebody had bought the address of my property in this game a couple
[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:18.700]   months ago and was now renting it out.
[02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:20.340]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:23.860]   PCMag started answering the big question.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:29.700]   What is the difference between a VoIP and UCAS, which is Unified Communications as a
[02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:31.020]   Service?
[02:20:31.020 --> 02:20:36.780]   The bottom line really is the definitions are not real clear.
[02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:38.100]   All about Android.
[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:41.900]   The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE.
[02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:45.740]   Always, as I recommend, make sure you have a case on them.
[02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:50.740]   Despite it being made out of plastic or a plastic, I recommend you have a case on it.
[02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:54.060]   And more importantly, supporting Big Mokodile to it.
[02:20:54.060 --> 02:20:55.060]   This is the year.
[02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:56.060]   Big Tech is out.
[02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:57.060]   Yes.
[02:20:57.060 --> 02:20:59.700]   Big Mokodile is in.
[02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:03.260]   We should mention, by the way, speaking of Samsung, we will be covering Samsung's event
[02:21:03.260 --> 02:21:04.260]   this Wednesday.
[02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:08.380]   It is 10 AM Eastern, 7 AM Pacific.
[02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:10.620]   So I'm making Jason how I'll do it.
[02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:13.860]   He will come in and you can watch Samsung.
[02:21:13.860 --> 02:21:19.100]   It's expected they'll announce the S, I think the S22 and probably a stylus and maybe some
[02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:20.140]   other things as well.
[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:31.860]   So Samsung unpacked Wednesday, February 9th, 10 AM Eastern, 3 PM GMT, 7 AM Pacific time.
[02:21:31.860 --> 02:21:33.380]   And watch our live stream of that.
[02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:38.660]   And of course, as with all of our live news streams, you can then watch it after the fact
[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:40.180]   on the Twitter feed.
[02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:45.380]   If you don't like ads on this show or any show, you can watch them also on your ad free feed
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:46.620]   as a member of Club Twitch.
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:52.100]   I hope you are a member.
[02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:58.540]   If you're not, $7 a month gets you ad free versions of all of our shows.
[02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:00.980]   You're paying us so we don't have to advertise to you.
[02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:03.140]   We don't have to do anything.
[02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:04.140]   So get that.
[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:07.140]   You also get access to the Discord, which is always fun.
[02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:13.580]   We have a really nice community in there and Twitch plus feed, which has not only some of
[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:19.340]   the guests out of, it has some unusual shows like our entitled Linux show, which is getting
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:24.460]   its own feed, Stacey's book club, which is monthly and is really fun.
[02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:26.820]   The Giz Fizz with Dick D. Bartolo.
[02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:29.980]   And we just launched this week in space Club Twitch members.
[02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:35.060]   We'll get to hear that first because we want to give them a chance to start the show in
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:37.220]   a friendly environment.
[02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:41.300]   So it'll appear only on Club Twitch at first, but eventually, of course, we hope to make
[02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:44.780]   it a public show, our newest show.
[02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:46.260]   And we can do that, by the way.
[02:22:46.260 --> 02:22:47.460]   It's an audio only show.
[02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:49.060]   Thanks to members of the club.
[02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:53.940]   So please, if you're not yet a member, help us do what we do best, which is make great
[02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:58.420]   content for you by going to twit.tv/clubfoottuit.
[02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:04.380]   All right, one more thing as long as I'm haranging you, we also want to encourage you to take
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:05.580]   our Twitter audience survey.
[02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:06.580]   I said we don't track you.
[02:23:06.580 --> 02:23:07.580]   We don't.
[02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:10.820]   But from time to time, we like to get to know our audience a little bit better.
[02:23:10.820 --> 02:23:12.820]   Others want to know.
[02:23:12.820 --> 02:23:17.580]   And of course, it helps us develop content more to your liking.
[02:23:17.580 --> 02:23:18.660]   It's our annual survey.
[02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:23.220]   Once a year, go to twit.tv/survey22 for the 2022 survey.
[02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:25.660]   It shouldn't take you more than a minute or two.
[02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:26.660]   And it really helps us.
[02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:28.900]   And of course, it's completely voluntary.
[02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:31.260]   So you don't have to answer any question.
[02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:32.460]   You can skip them.
[02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:34.460]   You can not take the quiz at all.
[02:23:34.460 --> 02:23:42.540]   But if you do want to help out a little bit, it's a great way to do that twit.tv/survey22.
[02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:45.620]   South Korea hacked him.
[02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:50.220]   So he did us the whole country.
[02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:55.140]   Hermit Kingdom, he's a US security researcher.
[02:23:55.140 --> 02:23:59.740]   And apparently he found out that the North Koreans, does he South Korea?
[02:23:59.740 --> 02:24:00.740]   I did.
[02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:01.740]   I met North Korea.
[02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:04.420]   There's somewhat of a difference.
[02:24:04.420 --> 02:24:11.380]   North Korea had hacked him and other-- I guess his handle is P4X.
[02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:16.340]   Gone after him and other Western security researchers trying to steal their hacking tools, find
[02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:19.020]   out what they knew about software vulnerabilities.
[02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:22.580]   He says he managed to prevent them from taking anything of value.
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:29.220]   But he was so upset by North Korean state-sponsored hackers targeting him personally.
[02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:34.300]   And by the lack of any visible response from the US government, he said, this is an
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:41.300]   article from Wired, Andy Greenberg writing, of course.
[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:48.740]   He said, after a year of simmering, he said, "I'm going to take matter into my own hands.
[02:24:48.740 --> 02:24:51.220]   It felt like the right thing to do here.
[02:24:51.220 --> 02:24:55.020]   If they don't see we have teeth, it's just going to keep coming."
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:25:02.020]   So he said he looked into it, found numerous known but unpached vulnerabilities in North
[02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:04.900]   Korea's systems.
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:10.420]   For instance, a known bug in Nginx that mishandled certain HTTP headers.
[02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:16.580]   He found ancient, his word versions of Apache.
[02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:21.740]   He started to examine North Korea's own national operating system, the Red Star OOS, which he
[02:25:21.740 --> 02:25:26.100]   described as an old and likely vulnerable version of Linux.
[02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:30.260]   He was able to single-handedly launch a denial of service.
[02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:32.060]   I don't know why I'm laughing, but I think it's…
[02:25:32.060 --> 02:25:33.980]   I come laughing because it's great.
[02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:38.420]   Single-handedly launched a denial of service attack on the entire nation, partly because
[02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:43.580]   they only have a handful of routers connected to the global internet.
[02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:49.140]   He said he largely automated his attacks periodically running scripts that enumerated the systems
[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:52.420]   still online and watching Hixplaits to take them down.
[02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:58.580]   "For me," says P4X, "it's like a small to medium-sized pen test."
[02:25:58.580 --> 02:26:04.700]   Pretty interesting how easy it was to actually have some effect there.
[02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:07.900]   And so I don't think he took it down for very long.
[02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:10.020]   I think as I remember it was just a few hours.
[02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:17.060]   But totally took the nation of North Korea offline.
[02:26:17.060 --> 02:26:19.140]   Cyber is asymmetrical.
[02:26:19.140 --> 02:26:20.140]   Yeah.
[02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:21.140]   Wow.
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:22.140]   I think…
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:23.140]   That's what…
[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:24.140]   What a story, huh?
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:32.900]   That's what's scary to me because if you look at the situation in Ukraine and Russia,
[02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:34.500]   I mean, yeah, Russia…
[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:38.900]   We see from satellite images that Russia is moving all of this military equipment and
[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:39.900]   troops.
[02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:46.580]   And what we don't see is what Russia might be lining up in the cyber realm or what Ukraine
[02:26:46.580 --> 02:26:51.220]   might be preparing as an asymmetrical response.
[02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:52.220]   Yeah.
[02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:54.220]   That's kind of…
[02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:58.100]   Other security researchers have also said, "Maybe you don't want to mess with it because
[02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:01.900]   maybe we have stuff going on that you might interrupt.
[02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:05.980]   So maybe just, you know, it's not the right way to go."
[02:27:05.980 --> 02:27:06.980]   Oh.
[02:27:06.980 --> 02:27:07.980]   Yeah.
[02:27:07.980 --> 02:27:13.020]   You know, in other words, you don't want them to suddenly harden their systems.
[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:16.060]   That law enforcement is always going to save them.
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:17.660]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:18.660]   I just…
[02:27:18.660 --> 02:27:19.940]   I like this story.
[02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:20.940]   And I don't like this story.
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:28.340]   Blackberry has decided to sell all its patents to a non-practicing entity.
[02:27:28.340 --> 02:27:29.940]   Kids we know what that means, right?
[02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:30.940]   Non-practicing entity.
[02:27:30.940 --> 02:27:31.940]   $600 million.
[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:33.860]   I can't blame them.
[02:27:33.860 --> 02:27:36.260]   That's a good amount of money.
[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:42.860]   They sold it to cattlepult IP innovations, which doesn't make anything or do anything.
[02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:47.700]   In fact, it was created specifically to buy these assets.
[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:50.940]   So they brought in, I guess, investors.
[02:27:50.940 --> 02:27:56.500]   Blackberry gets $450 million in cash, a promissory note for $150 million.
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:57.500]   What is…
[02:27:57.500 --> 02:27:58.500]   What is…
[02:27:58.500 --> 02:27:59.500]   I…
[02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:02.300]   Cattlepult IP get the right to sue.
[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:04.740]   And so I think you're going to see…
[02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:05.740]   Maybe not just…
[02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:06.740]   Maybe not…
[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:07.740]   You know what?
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:08.740]   That's…
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:09.740]   That's judgmental.
[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:10.740]   The right to charge royalties.
[02:28:10.740 --> 02:28:13.740]   And then sue if they don't get paid.
[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:21.260]   I'm surprised that Google, Microsoft, Apple, like why wasn't there a consortium of industry
[02:28:21.260 --> 02:28:27.140]   players who came out and made a decent market clearing bid for…
[02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:29.620]   So Google's done that before, actually.
[02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:34.020]   They've bought up old patents and said, "We're not going to…
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:35.380]   We're going to indemnify everybody.
[02:28:35.380 --> 02:28:37.300]   We're not going to assert these patents.
[02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:38.300]   Go ahead.
[02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:41.300]   Have at it."
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:46.780]   So, should we say shame on you, Blackberry?
[02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:49.260]   Or maybe we should wait and see.
[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:50.260]   We'll see.
[02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:54.940]   You know, if you think about it, the patents were going to be with a non-practicing entity
[02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:57.700]   one way or another because Blackberry is way out of…
[02:28:57.700 --> 02:28:59.100]   Yeah, they don't do it.
[02:28:59.100 --> 02:29:00.100]   Yeah.
[02:29:00.100 --> 02:29:01.100]   It's the mobile business.
[02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:02.100]   Yeah.
[02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:05.300]   They actually had licensed some of these technologies, so there's money to be made on it.
[02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:06.300]   Maybe it's just a license.
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:09.060]   Maybe it's just they're going to license, make money on licensing.
[02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:10.060]   Maybe that's it.
[02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:11.060]   I shouldn't assume.
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:12.060]   I shouldn't assume.
[02:29:12.060 --> 02:29:13.060]   But I agree with you, Owen.
[02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:17.500]   That would have been a smart thing to do for Microsoft Apple.
[02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:22.860]   Google companies that make devices that use these patents to maybe just get together and
[02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:27.460]   buy them up.
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:28.460]   Let's see.
[02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:30.820]   North Korea.
[02:29:30.820 --> 02:29:33.620]   I think I've covered everything.
[02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:41.220]   The House anyway has passed a bill to invest in chip manufacturing R&D.
[02:29:41.220 --> 02:29:44.540]   This is the America Capets Act of 2022.
[02:29:44.540 --> 02:29:50.980]   The Senate passed something similar last summer, the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, so
[02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:53.420]   the bills will have to be reconciled.
[02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:58.340]   The House version includes $52 billion in funding to help send me conductors companies
[02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:01.460]   build new factories to fund research and development.
[02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:05.660]   The President says he will sign that as soon as it comes to his desk.
[02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:08.660]   This is probably a good thing.
[02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:16.460]   It's a direct way to address the chip shortage and encourage new factories to open in the
[02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:18.560]   U.S.
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:23.460]   It is, but on the scale of time that it takes to build a factory, is that really good?
[02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:26.580]   It's going to take a while.
[02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:32.340]   I do think it is fascinating, though, that the ongoing chip shortage, often it's not
[02:30:32.340 --> 02:30:34.180]   the most cutting-edge chips.
[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:41.060]   It's these older chips that get embedded and do really simple functions like roll your window
[02:30:41.060 --> 02:30:43.740]   up or down in a car.
[02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:48.060]   The fact that we're having shortages in those is telling.
[02:30:48.060 --> 02:30:53.020]   Actually, a good article in Business Insider Car Company stand to make billions by charging
[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:58.020]   your monthly fees for adding features like heated seats unless they can't get the heated
[02:30:58.020 --> 02:30:59.020]   seats in.
[02:30:59.020 --> 02:31:02.060]   General Motors actually stopped putting heated seats in some of their vehicles because they
[02:31:02.060 --> 02:31:04.020]   couldn't get the chips.
[02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:10.820]   Right, because you need a temperature, you need a thermometer basically to make sure that
[02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:14.220]   the heat doesn't get too high.
[02:31:14.220 --> 02:31:22.380]   It's all of this little sensors, all of this little electromechanical features that you
[02:31:22.380 --> 02:31:24.700]   don't really think about.
[02:31:24.700 --> 02:31:30.340]   A lot of manufacturers have taken the approach of, "Okay, you're not getting power steering
[02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:32.660]   in your car."
[02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:43.820]   We in our Twit community forums, Twit.community, I got a great message from Cortex_M0 because
[02:31:43.820 --> 02:31:48.380]   we were talking about this and these legacy nodes in the heated seats.
[02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:51.900]   He wanted to address this because we've also talked about how much Samsung spending $17
[02:31:51.900 --> 02:31:57.740]   billion to build factories, Intel spending $20 billion to build factories in Ohio.
[02:31:57.740 --> 02:32:01.780]   We've talked about how the big chip guys are stepping up TSMC.
[02:32:01.780 --> 02:32:06.740]   He said there's also significant investment in additional fabrication capacity for legacy
[02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:07.740]   nodes.
[02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:10.740]   TI is making a huge investment.
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:15.420]   Three new fabs under construction in the United States, one due to be online this year.
[02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:16.420]   One next.
[02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:20.900]   However, he says, "Every vendor I hear from, I guess he must work in this industry," says
[02:32:20.900 --> 02:32:23.060]   their backlogs have no end in sight.
[02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:28.820]   The CEO of Swiss-based ST Microelectronics told analysts last week his company had about
[02:32:28.820 --> 02:32:36.460]   40% more orders than projected capacity for 2022, 40% more than they can make.
[02:32:36.460 --> 02:32:42.540]   That's despite ST bringing on whole new fabrication plants in Lombardy, Italy.
[02:32:42.540 --> 02:32:47.380]   Also despite the fact that he said in January that his company was sold out for the year.
[02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:53.660]   The companies which have recently opened fabs include Infineon in Austria and Bosch in Dresden.
[02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:57.060]   I'm not sure if these are operating in capacity yet or if they're running at low capacity
[02:32:57.060 --> 02:32:59.780]   while setting up tooling and qualifications.
[02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:02.340]   Thank you, Cortex, for that extra information.
[02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:10.420]   Yes, it is often these older chips, but there's a response to that as well.
[02:33:10.420 --> 02:33:12.260]   Maybe not Pito.
[02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:16.740]   Maybe next year.
[02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:18.660]   Guys, I'm going to let you go.
[02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:20.140]   It's been a blast.
[02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:21.980]   I hope you have a wonderful week.
[02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:24.140]   I thank you so much for joining us.
[02:33:24.140 --> 02:33:27.380]   Nicholas De Leon from Consumer Reports.
[02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:29.420]   He's their senior electronics reporter.
[02:33:29.420 --> 02:33:33.100]   It's funny that you mentioned you're going to do something on crypto because I felt like
[02:33:33.100 --> 02:33:37.700]   this morning on the radio show I spent about 10 minutes just trying to explain blockchain
[02:33:37.700 --> 02:33:40.900]   NFTs and Web3.
[02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:46.100]   Because people hear this and I don't know, I think even for me it took me a while to even
[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:47.660]   understand what's going on.
[02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:49.020]   That's one of the hardest part of this article.
[02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:51.220]   I don't want to give it to it about the article.
[02:33:51.220 --> 02:34:00.340]   Just explaining all this cockamamie stuff, magic, internet money, and imagine it's easy
[02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:03.660]   enough to talk to people who deal with tech every day.
[02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:08.180]   For CR it is the most mainstream audience in publishing.
[02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:14.900]   You don't want to say to them, even your dollar bill is made up, it's just a piece of
[02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:15.900]   paper, kids.
[02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:17.900]   That's what I've tried in the past.
[02:34:17.900 --> 02:34:18.900]   People just like looking at it.
[02:34:18.900 --> 02:34:19.900]   Scares the hell out of them.
[02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:20.900]   They don't want to hear that.
[02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:23.820]   Yeah, it's very so challenging.
[02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:28.940]   The only reason we're even doing this is people have asked is can you talk about these topics.
[02:34:28.940 --> 02:34:34.300]   And by the way, you've got to do it in 1500 words, so get to work.
[02:34:34.300 --> 02:34:35.700]   Yeah, I've doubled that.
[02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:36.700]   Oh, good.
[02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:38.700]   It's a long one.
[02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:40.300]   It's fun.
[02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:41.300]   I enjoy it.
[02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:43.620]   I think the topic is just inherently interesting.
[02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:48.260]   Again, like I was saying earlier, some of the products may be a little hypey or whatever.
[02:34:48.260 --> 02:34:51.820]   But we wouldn't be doing it, folks didn't ask us to look at this stuff.
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:52.820]   Yeah.
[02:34:52.820 --> 02:34:58.220]   And as you were saying, Dan, and I can't wait to hear the interview tomorrow with Tim O'Reilly,
[02:34:58.220 --> 02:35:02.340]   but there is some very interesting technology here that probably is going to be around for
[02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:05.540]   a long time, like blockchain in interesting uses.
[02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:08.580]   So it's important for people to understand that too, I think.
[02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:15.580]   Dan Patterson, so great to have you technology reporter CBS News, CBSNews.com/live.
[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:16.580]   Don't forget you can--
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:17.580]   Not that is.
[02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:21.100]   Now, do you have a regular time slot or anything?
[02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:26.540]   No, I do segments throughout the week, and I write stories.
[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:33.700]   So tomorrow I'm on in the 7.40A Eastern Hour, but it could be the afternoon evening.
[02:35:33.700 --> 02:35:38.220]   Sometimes it's when news breaks, other times it's when I have a story.
[02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:46.100]   I am really glad that CBS is taking streaming seriously, because I've always thought CBS
[02:35:46.100 --> 02:35:48.140]   News was like the quality.
[02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:51.780]   Ever since Edward R. Murrow, it's the Tiffany network.
[02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:54.540]   And I hope that that standard still applies.
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:57.500]   I think it does, and we need it.
[02:35:57.500 --> 02:36:00.780]   So I'm glad that they're taking streaming seriously.
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:03.140]   This is obviously the future of broadcasting.
[02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:04.140]   Yes?
[02:36:04.140 --> 02:36:05.140]   Yeah.
[02:36:05.140 --> 02:36:07.700]   We take streaming seriously.
[02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:09.580]   In the chat room wants to know just a question.
[02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:10.420]   You don't have to answer it.
[02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:14.900]   Are you really tall or do you have a very low ceiling?
[02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:17.340]   I know I have a lofted apartment.
[02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:18.340]   OK.
[02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:22.540]   Because it looks like you're scraping the ceiling there.
[02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:25.940]   It has big hair, too, right?
[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:26.940]   That is true.
[02:36:26.940 --> 02:36:28.740]   Now I'm just--
[02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:29.740]   It's New York.
[02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:30.740]   What do you want?
[02:36:30.740 --> 02:36:34.580]   They don't have room for high ceilings.
[02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:36.900]   It's very-- it's still a little island.
[02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:38.380]   There's not a lot of room.
[02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:39.220]   Thank you, Dan Spread.
[02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:39.980]   Great to have you.
[02:36:39.980 --> 02:36:41.220]   And of course, always a pleasure.
[02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:46.900]   Owen Thomas, I hope to see you at the theater someday soon.
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:48.740]   I think it's the last time I saw you in person.
[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:51.580]   Was it the Golden Gate Theater in San Francisco?
[02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:52.260]   That's right.
[02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:54.140]   Was it Hamilton Night?
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:54.900]   I don't remember.
[02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:57.740]   But you were with-- I think you were with Ian Thompson.
[02:36:57.740 --> 02:36:59.860]   And you were just coming out.
[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:00.820]   We were just going in.
[02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:02.900]   And it was great to see you.
[02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:04.620]   And I don't know if it was--
[02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:06.220]   Remember?
[02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:07.100]   Remember theater?
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:08.100]   Remember theaters?
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:09.100]   Theater.
[02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:11.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:14.740]   You know, Lisa and I were all set to go back to New York,
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:16.900]   and then they closed Broadway again.
[02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:18.780]   So we're just going to have to wait.
[02:37:18.780 --> 02:37:19.580]   Just have to wait.
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:20.500]   It's great to have you, Owen.
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:21.420]   Thank you for being here.
[02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:22.180]   Protocol is--
[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:22.980]   Thanks for having me.
[02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:26.180]   --very good publication, protocol.com.
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:28.740]   Thanks to all of you for joining us, by the way.
[02:37:28.740 --> 02:37:30.300]   We do Twitch Sunday afternoons.
[02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:31.420]   We take all the weeks news.
[02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:34.940]   We mush it up in a great big ball and then throw it at you.
[02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:39.900]   All you have to do to watch live is go to twit.tv/live.
[02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:42.140]   Or you can go to live.twit.tv.
[02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:46.460]   And we do that live stream about 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern,
[02:37:46.460 --> 02:37:48.300]   2230 UTC.
[02:37:48.300 --> 02:37:52.460]   People who watch live like to chat live, that's at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:37:52.460 --> 02:37:54.340]   You can do it with a browser or an IRC client.
[02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:55.220]   It doesn't matter.
[02:37:55.220 --> 02:37:58.500]   IRC.twit.tv or in the Discord channel,
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:37:59.980]   if you're a member of Club Twit.
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:03.980]   After the fact, every show we do is available on our website.
[02:38:03.980 --> 02:38:06.020]   For most of the show's audio and video,
[02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:07.860]   although, as I said, we're going to try some new audio
[02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:09.660]   shows, which is cool.
[02:38:09.660 --> 02:38:12.020]   Twit.tv is the website.
[02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:13.100]   Twit.tv/club.
[02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:14.620]   Twit to sign up for Club Twit.
[02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:19.460]   Twit.tv/store to buy mugs or face diapers
[02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:22.500]   with the Twit logo on it, whatever it is you wear in them.
[02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:26.660]   Yeah, we have really good looking masks.
[02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:27.620]   With all our--
[02:38:27.620 --> 02:38:30.140]   you could have the security now mask, which I think
[02:38:30.140 --> 02:38:32.500]   would be a good conversation starter,
[02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:35.020]   not to have Steve Gibson on your face.
[02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:37.020]   That's at Twit.tv/store.
[02:38:37.020 --> 02:38:41.300]   You have two ways to interact with us after the fact.
[02:38:41.300 --> 02:38:43.220]   You can go to our Twit.community, which
[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:46.940]   is our discourse forums, regular kind of forums,
[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:47.740]   online forums.
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:50.700]   We also have a Mastodon instance at Twit.social,
[02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:53.260]   kind of like Twitter for the Fediverse.
[02:38:53.260 --> 02:38:55.900]   There's a YouTube channel for this show on all the shows,
[02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:57.860]   so you can watch the video.
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:00.620]   Best thing to do would be subscribe in your favorite podcast
[02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:02.020]   player, so you get it automatically.
[02:39:02.020 --> 02:39:05.060]   And if your podcast player allows for reviews,
[02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:07.420]   please leave us a five-star review.
[02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:08.140]   Let the world know.
[02:39:08.140 --> 02:39:12.700]   You listen to the world's longest continuous running technology
[02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:15.060]   podcast.
[02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:17.020]   17 years.
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:18.660]   17 years.
[02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:21.980]   We're going to celebrate an anniversary in April, right, John?
[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:25.060]   2015.
[02:39:25.060 --> 02:39:29.380]   2005, 17 plus 2, carry the 4.
[02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:30.700]   I think it's 17 years.
[02:39:30.700 --> 02:39:32.740]   I'm pretty sure.
[02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:33.900]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:34.700]   We'll see you next time.
[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:35.660]   Another Twit.
[02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:36.860]   This is in the can.
[02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:39.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:40.940]   Do the Twit.
[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:41.940]   Do the Twit.
[02:39:41.940 --> 02:39:42.940]   All right.
[02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:43.940]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:44.940]   Do the Twit.
[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:45.940]   All right.
[02:39:45.940 --> 02:39:47.940]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:39:47.940 --> 02:39:49.940]   Do the Twit.
