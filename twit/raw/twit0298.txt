[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   It's time for Twit the Show that covers all the technology news.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   I'm laughing because we have a full house in the Twit Studios.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.400]   You know, I don't know what happened.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   It used to be that a holiday would come and I wouldn't be able to get anybody to do Twit.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400]   And I'd sit here doing it all by myself.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.400]   And lo and behold, we got like eight people in this little teensy,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   weensy room starting with to my left.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   My good friend, an old radio partner, Gina Smith,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   who is now editor in chief of Bite Magazine.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   I'm coming back.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   Good to have you back.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   Yeah, a bunch of people in the chat room,
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   which we received from your listeners at Twit.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400]   You're getting contributors from our chat audience?
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   I came on your show.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   That does not sound good.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.400]   I came on your show.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   I came on Twit to actually announce Bite and asked for contributors.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   About 1,500 emails took the best of the best.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   And teambite is 60.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   You have a team.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   Amazing people from Purnell.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   You're going to get Purnell, right?
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   You're going to get Jerry Purnell on that.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   I got Jerry.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   He's mine.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   And it'll be at bite.com.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   Will you do a paper magazine?
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   www.bite.com.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   And I don't know if we'll do a paper magazine or not.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   I for sure will do special PDFs.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   If you want to be around, my suggestion,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   don't do a paper magazine.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400]   Exactly.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   You know who knows about this?
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   Mark Million is here.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   Formerly with the LA Times.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   And now Mark is at CNN.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   No more dead trees for him.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   No paper involved there.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   I don't know what happened to your lower third.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   It says you're with AAA.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   Let me just fix that.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   How is that?
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   That's CNN.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   I must have leaned on the --
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   I like to -- I like the folks at CNN when I was at ABC.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   Are you at CNN's -- LA or San Francisco?
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   San Francisco.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   So you're up here now?
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   That's great.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   Live in San Francisco?
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   I always say San Fran, but apparently that's not acceptable here.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   It's been a little bit more porn here, which are like one out of every 400 people you'll
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   need.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   Hate San Fran.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   For example, I said it once in front of my wife.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   That was nine and a half years ago.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   I've never said it's a set on this.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   We call it the city.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   The city.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   It's called the city.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   Which confuses everybody.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   Because there's like which city?
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   My wife's lived here for 30 years and I've never heard her call her that.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   She called it San Francisco.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.400]   Very explicit.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   No diminutive, no Frisco, no San Fran.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   That ladies and gentlemen, that guy is Patrick.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   Frisco is bad.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   Don't say that to the Hell's Angels because that's what's printed on a lot of their
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   T-shirts.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   Oh, really?
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Well, our offices are down around the corner.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   Are you down by Santa Cruz?
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   No.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   Are the revision three offices are around the corner from the San Francisco Hell's Angels.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Santa Cruz.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   Well, Santa Cruz is the Los Angels.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   Is that where the Hell's Angels are?
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   The Henry's a criminal attorney instead of the lot of the Hell's Angels are down there.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   That's where I grew up.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   The devil lives in Santa Cruz.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   Well, that's where the devil is from.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   The Santa Cruz was the devil.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   Yeah, the devil comes from Santa Cruz.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Patrick Norton from Techzilla, my old buddy.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   And you were in the desert last week when we did our sixth anniversary tour.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   So thank you for the video.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   We played it.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   It was really, really nice.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   My apologies for thinking it was the fifth anniversary.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   Can you believe it's been six years?
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   No, apparently I couldn't.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   It's a shocker, isn't it?
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   Well, it was, we had Kevin and David Prager and Robert Herron back and it was really fun,
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   but we did miss you.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   It wasn't the same with that, just so thank you for coming this week.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   Did we save any of that champent?
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   No, of course not.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   So we'll just take a shot.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   This champent in the future.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   There is?
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   There is.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   I saw him.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   I start drinking everyone runs.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   Oh, that's right.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   He's a black coffee guy, a guy.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   Would you like some black coffee?
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   Always.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   Okay, black coffee for Mr. Norton.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   The Pope celebrate Easter.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.400]   So there was so much news this week.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   It's kind of hard to know where to begin.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   One of the things we spend a lot of time on Mac Break Weekly talking about is Samsung
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   and Apple.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.400]   Samsung, who released, has actually quite a, I think, a very good Android phone, the
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   Galaxy S.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   Apple sued saying it's a direct copy of the iPhone.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   Mark, you've probably been following this story.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   Is there any merit in that?
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   Well, I mean, Apple seems to be on a frenzy recently with their patent lawsuits.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   So I'm guessing they overstaffed in that department and they're just looking for
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   something to do.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   They have a big, that's what happens when you hire lawyers by the yard.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   Samsung responds by account or something.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   Samsung is one of the big suppliers to Apple.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   They supply about almost $5 billion a year worth of gear.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   Make the A5 chip.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   The A5 for the iPad 2.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   They make a lot of the flash RAM that's used in all Apple devices.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   But now we actually, if you go back and listen to Mac Break Weekly this week, we had
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   Neelai Patel on, who is not only former editor at Engadget, but wrote a very good
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   piece on his website talking about this.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   And he's also an IP editor, a former IP, a reformed IP.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   What does he think?
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   You know, he thought there was some merit to it.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   In fact, if you go to his website, which is the next big thing, is that right?
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   Say again?
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   This is my next big thing.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   I guess next big thing was taken.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   This is my, that's a lot of type.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   Sorry, I have to type now.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   This is my next big thing that doesn't work either.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   This is my next title.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   This is my next.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   Oh, this is my next whatever.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   They say online, this is my next title.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:53.400]   And he has a very, I think, a very good and lengthy article about the suit and the countersuit.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   But let me show you.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   The article is good because it has the points of comparison that Samsung provided in their
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   Apple provided in their lawsuit.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   By the way, you can see right in the front page, it is a complaint for patent infringement,
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   federal false designation of origin, and unfair competition, federal trademark infringement,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   state unfair competition, common law trademark infringement, and unjust enrichment.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   Apple's contention is that Samsung intended to confuse consumers by releasing a phone that
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   looks so much like the iPhone that consumers might accidentally buy it.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   Yes, that'll happen.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   Now, there's one picture from the, yeah.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   I mean, this is my point is that I don't think anybody was fooled by this.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.400]   But look at this.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   This is the Samsung phone on the left, the iPhone on the right.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   This is Samsung's Android kind of sugar that they put on top of it.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   I'm just looking at this and I'm like, okay, actually the icons.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   Well, look at the icons.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   I'm with the lawyers, the icons.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   Here's the icons.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   So on the left, Apple, on the right, Samsung.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   Yeah, they're all about the drop shadow.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   But I'm going to tell you, look, if you're going to do an icon for a phone app, you're
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   going to put a handset on it.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   Now it's green and it's got a gradient.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   If you're going to do a chat, they've got a chat bubble, chat bubble with a smile.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   Yeah, flower, flower.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   The flower is kind of bad.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   The gear in the settings, they've got a notepad for the notepad.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   But see, that's kind of just literal minded.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   What do you think, Patrick?
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   I don't know.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   Yes, okay.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.680]   One, Apple and Samsung are obviously severely pissed off at each other because Samsung's
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.480]   countersuing in four countries.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.400]   They're going for 10 major patents.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.960]   Well, this is what happens when you do a patent or a trademark lawsuit.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.800]   It's mutually assured destruction, right?
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   Exactly.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.200]   People acquire patents specifically so that you won't sue them so that if you do sue
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.800]   them, they can countersue you.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.440]   Yeah, and Reuters is saying like the Samsung countersuits involve power reductions during
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.680]   data transmission, 3G technology, producing errors during data transmission, wireless data
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.200]   communications technology.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.880]   So Samsung's like great.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.840]   You want to get pissy about a retail product.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.440]   We're going to try to undermine how effective your device functions as a phone.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.520]   With our own chips.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   That's a big stick.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.120]   Well, let me just throw something else in because I showed this to Niele and this is,
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.600]   of course, he said, yes, we've all seen this.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.280]   The phone on left is a Samsung phone.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   It's the F700.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.760]   It predates the iPhone.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.760]   Samsung.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:28.040]   Amazon could probably pretty reasonably say, judge, it went the other way.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.680]   The left phone is a Samsung phone and predates their phone on the right, the iPhone.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.240]   But icons aren't in color.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   They aren't.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.760]   You don't have the same icon issue.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.440]   I think any phone is any smartphone these days going to have a big glass screen.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.240]   Stick, you hold up next to your head.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   How many does that?
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   Nokia.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240]   How many ways do you do it?
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   How many ways do you do it?
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240]   They did the taco phone.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.960]   One of the most epic fails in phone history.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   Exactly.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.560]   The flip phones are effectively dead.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.080]   Slide out keyboards or the minority at this point.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.240]   Even when you close the keyboard, you still have a stick, a box, a deck of cards, a pack
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.400]   of cigarettes, you hold up next to your head.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.280]   There's not much to go to.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:11.840]   That's kind of my point is, what will come down to in court, I guess, is did Samsung
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.240]   intentionally attempt to deceive consumers?
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   Did they?
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   It doesn't matter.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.080]   It's about what you try to prove in court.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   Right.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.680]   It's a much larger playing field.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.760]   Now, Apple's got lawyers dancing in three continents, five, six countries, something
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.760]   like that.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.760]   This is going to be crazy.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.400]   It's going to cost stockholders a fortune.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.240]   It's not going to cost us.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.320]   You have me, Apple's lawyer has in the building.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.320]   Yeah, they're ready to go internally.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.240]   This is like chilling effect.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.440]   They have 100 plus lawyers, I think.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.040]   I think they have their own building.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.440]   They do have their own building down there.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.440]   The lawyer building.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   Probably.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.800]   Remember when Apple was suing Microsoft because they thought that Microsoft had ripped off
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   the trash can.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   The recycle bin.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   The recycle bin and everything.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   In fact, Microsoft had ripped off the Apple GUI and then zero.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.520]   But Apple lost that lawsuit.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.480]   Apple lost that lawsuit and Xerox came up and said, wait a minute, Apple, where did
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.200]   you think you got your old drag and drop interface?
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.800]   Apple did a legitimate exchange of technology with Xerox for the walkthrough on park.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.400]   That was a deal between Xerox and Apple.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   Microsoft saw a good thing and took as much for it as they could.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.960]   We don't need to pay for this.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.280]   It's just a trash can.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   We'll just borrow the trash can.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.720]   Microsoft took what they could and with Windows, they put out more lawyers.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   They did.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.640]   That was a look and feel lost.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.640]   It's different than that.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.600]   Joshua Topolsky does point out that Samsung phone shipped after the iPhone but was announced
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   before the iPhone.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.640]   I think the announcement showed what it was going to look like.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.040]   I bet you they got a problem that's beyond this that we're not seeing.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.800]   Samsung and Apple are tight partners in the hardware realm.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.000]   They've got something going on.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.960]   They got in a huge fight and they just decided to unleash lawyers.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.120]   Which one did you fly on the wall?
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.520]   No, you stole it.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.360]   I did not use stolen.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.520]   I'm going to sue you.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.520]   Go ahead.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.960]   I'll sue you for my battery management chip.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.720]   It also makes me wonder if the difference, because we've seen it Sony where obviously
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.320]   the music department and the people that made the Walkman follow-ups never actually spoke
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.560]   to each other so that Sony crippled itself and portable music players at least outside
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.920]   of mini-discs because the people in Sony, basically the music department had sway over
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.800]   the control of whether or not Sony made a legitimate MP3 player.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.480]   Sony forced ATRACS and MP3 players fell incredibly far behind.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.800]   You wonder if Samsung, if the people who make the phones inside of Samsung do a lot of talking
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.400]   with the people who sell the components from that area of Samsung.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.120]   This was your talk a lot to each other but do the management research.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.520]   This was realized contention is that Samsung is a big karetsu and that it's so big that
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.200]   these different divisions, in fact he said when the cell phone division wants to buy
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.320]   a flash ram, they bid for it for Samsung's flash ram just like any other company.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.560]   So it's completely possible to sue the cell phone division and not have that impact the
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.560]   A5 supply.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.160]   Even the consumer divisions of Samsung operate very differently.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.400]   Like the TV divisions, the home theater versus mobile.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.680]   They're in different states, they're in different countries in some instances.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.600]   It's probably good for those companies on some level or those business units.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.800]   Look at how Microsoft's bogged down by being so big and all in the same place and the divisions
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   fight with each other.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   Microsoft never kept a clean wall between its apps and the television.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.280]   Well you can't release a product in Microsoft without some other product manager saying
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.080]   "Oh" and killing it.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   I mean it's just nasty.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.320]   Yeah but the downside of that is that when there's not sharing then people are developing
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.280]   the same things in separate divisions.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.240]   Like movies, and windows, and services.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.080]   Zoom is a great example of that.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.640]   But you know Microsoft they're now sharing connects to the windows.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.640]   I like that.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.120]   Microsoft has become the open transparent.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.120]   The underdog.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   Underdog.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   I love that.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.400]   Google has become the new Microsoft.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.240]   And Microsoft has become the new Lotus.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.240]   And who is?
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.240]   Yeah right.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   Or IBM.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   Or like IBM.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   Actually you're right.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.240]   I think Microsoft's like IBM.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.240]   So Microsoft's IBM.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   Google is Microsoft.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.240]   Felipe Con.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.240]   Felipe Con.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.080]   Who is Apple in that?
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.840]   If Microsoft is IBM and Google is Microsoft.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840]   Apple's Apple.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.840]   Apple's Apple but me.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   They haven't changed.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.720]   Apple but meaner than it ever was.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   But they're mean.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   They're the mean Apple.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.360]   They're the older Wiser Apple.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.360]   They're the Darth Vader version.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.720]   They're the dark side.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.200]   So there's a few more Apple stores we'll get to but there's one that's just completely
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.840]   stupid and trivial but I think surprising.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.040]   Apparently white iPhones are appearing now in Santa Clara at stores in Santa Clara.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.480]   Is this available this week?
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   There are white iPhones.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   Do you care?
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.480]   No I wouldn't.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   Patrick are you going to trade yours in?
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.280]   I know you really like the girly look.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.520]   You know I don't own.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.120]   This is the only white.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.640]   This is the only white portable device.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.240]   I like the big X on it.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.360]   Ever own for the rest of my life.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.200]   Is that to hide the Apple or just because you're.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.760]   Well partially to hide the Apple because I enjoy hiding the giant white light on the
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.280]   back of the notebook that irritates everyone around.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.280]   It does.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.280]   It doesn't mean anything.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.320]   But mostly because when I first got this like three or four years ago at revision three
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.800]   like 19 people out of 25 had white iPads.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.560]   Yours is obviously different.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560]   Yes.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.640]   Because I actually picked up the wrong notebook after meeting one day and got back to my desk
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.240]   and I was like I'm never going to pick up the wrong notebook.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.080]   And in case of earthquake that's structurally more sound.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.480]   That's really why you do it.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.760]   It's funny is he's got his apple covered up.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760]   Oh I lost it.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.960]   I used to have an apple sticker on your Asus.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   On your Asus.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.840]   Hey I like that.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.120]   He's rocking the Twit logo.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.280]   Where did you get that one?
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.280]   That's from you.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.280]   Really?
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.280]   Oh yeah.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.280]   And what's bread pig?
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.080]   Because you have two stickers in your laptop.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.280]   This is Alexis O'Hannion the founder of Reddit that's his stuff.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.320]   Like do whatever he wants.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.120]   Project where he publishes the XKCD book and he works.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.120]   Oh cool.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.120]   Well that's named.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.200]   Bread to pick is neat.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.680]   Reddit deserves a lot of credit.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.680]   Reddit went deaf.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.680]   Rough week at Reddit.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.080]   Yeah we're going to talk about the rough week for a lot of servers including PlayStation
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.240]   Network.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.880]   And anybody running on.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.880]   Is the PlayStation still down?
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.800]   Yeah anybody running on EC2.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.360]   But let's take a break.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.440]   We'll come back and talk more.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.680]   Our guest Gina Smith the new editor in chief of Bite Magazine.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.400]   Yes it's back baby.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.760]   Mark Millian from CNN.com.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.920]   My old buddy Patrick Norton from Tixxilla.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.320]   I have to say it takes a lot.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.320]   It takes a lot.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.320]   It takes a lot.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.320]   Yeah baby.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   It takes a lot.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.400]   I want to talk a little bit about Go to Meeting very quickly though from our good friends
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   at Citrix.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.440]   Gina and I have some stories to tell about Citrix and Yakubuchi.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.600]   We do add Yakubuchi.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.760]   He started now he's doing like net jets or something right?
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.560]   What he's doing now is small private jets.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.680]   Private little two-year jets.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.560]   Which you own an hour or you lease it.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.560]   You buy them.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.560]   I'd like one of those.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.560]   Can you put me down for one?
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   Citrix and when we met him it was to link a bunch of XT's together.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:20.720]   Remember the 8088 based XT computer to link a bunch of his small-to user.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.560]   He was at IBM and he was in charge of the OS2 project at IBM.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:30.540]   Way back when Microsoft decided to trick IBM and do Windows and stuff.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:35.480]   Well the funny thing is there was a kind of intellectual property trade and Yakubuchi
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.200]   went to Microsoft to help with NT and Microsoft sends people to help with OS2 and guess who
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.080]   got the better deal on that one.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.180]   NT's operating system is like three quarters OS2 according to Yakubuchi.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.840]   As a result he knew better than anybody how to do remote access on NT and that's where
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.880]   you get this amazing back end that is powering all the Citrix products.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.640]   They know remote access.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.960]   Now here's a nice application for remote access.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.080]   You don't want to make a trip to visit with a client or a colleague and a conference call
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.440]   seems so stale and well just non-visual.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.360]   What about go to meeting?
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.400]   Now I know you've seen web conferencing solutions.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.800]   There's nothing better than go to meeting.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   It's fast.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   It's easy.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.360]   Now you can do a go to meeting on a Mac, a PC.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.080]   You can even attend to go to meeting.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.760]   I did this the other day on an iPad.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.640]   Go to meeting has absolutely as part of the deal absolutely free.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.560]   It has teleconferencing built in so you set up a phone bridge when you set up the meeting
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:35.480]   but you can also use the computer's own microphone and speakers and use VoIP.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.920]   It is just the simplest best way for collaboration, for planning, for sales presentations, weekly
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.880]   status updates, whatever you need to do when your team gets together.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.720]   If they're spread out use go to meeting.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   That's what we do.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.240]   We do go to meeting several times a week now.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.960]   In fact, actually I think we had to buy a second account we were doing.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.280]   So many go to meetings.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.400]   You could try it free right now.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.720]   If you just visit go to meeting.com click the try it free button and enter TWIT in the
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.200]   offer code box that will give you 30 days free.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.840]   If you haven't tried it yet please do.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.680]   It really is the best and we thank them so much for supporting our network in this
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   weekend tech.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.400]   It was just over to the new studio.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.280]   We did a little Skype visit to the new studio.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.280]   You were watching that.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.280]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   I can't wait because we're good with our show.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.920]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   Have you been over you haven't seen it yet?
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   I was actually just sitting there and playing with you.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   You didn't see it.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.920]   You were behind me?
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   Yes.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.920]   You were behind me with the dog.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   You're kidding.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.920]   Patrick was there.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.920]   Why did you say hi?
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   Well you were busy.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   You were talking.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   You cracked me.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.920]   You were talking in too.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.920]   You were talking in too.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.920]   He was trailing you.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.920]   He was right behind you.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.920]   I was also giggling hysterically like dude if you wanted to be alone in your office she
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.920]   just didn't have to build up the network.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.640]   It was an Easter egg.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.160]   Patrick was an Easter egg in our little office tour.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.400]   You went Easter egg in my game.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   A human Easter egg.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   You look like one actually.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   You're bright yellow today.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400]   I like that.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   It's one of my Jane shirts.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   Oh I like it.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   It's really good.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   It's got some.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   Brown coat on.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.000]   Mysterious Chinese and a gun.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.520]   So what did you think?
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.520]   It's amazing.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   Can you believe that?
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.840]   I was actually kind of like look at Leo.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   Media magnets.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.880]   Go in the tour of the Yufusu.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.680]   I'm like he must be buying land up in Mendocino County.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.840]   Oh God I wish I were.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.120]   We used to have to stay at the travel lodge.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.360]   We went to Las Vegas.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.160]   Yeah we've come a little ways.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.000]   We've come a long way.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.400]   It's with any construction project.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.120]   It's turned out to be a little more pricey than we thought.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.320]   Take the initial estimate.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.520]   Triple it and then double that in the last week.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   Pretty close actually.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.320]   We haven't got to the last week part yet.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.760]   Well God I hope you're wrong on that part.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.040]   But it takes twice as long cost twice as much basically right.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.560]   That's why it's important to have good quality accounting.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.720]   What does it give me time?
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.960]   Everybody asks me that exactly.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.800]   The answer is when it's done.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.920]   If you said April then you said maybe you said June 15.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.920]   I think we're talking June 15.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.080]   The reason Gina cares is because bike cast can't launch until we actually have a round
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.080]   to.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   I want to be like you know.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.080]   You'll be one of the launch podcast.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.080]   I would be one of your first launch.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.080]   It's actually probably will be the launch podcast.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.080]   And I'm hoping that you'll.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.920]   But we're sitting you know here's the thing.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.440]   We're sitting in a room that was designed for me and just me alone on a camera.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.240]   And we're jammed in here and we've got like five people in the audience.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.560]   That means crazy.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.320]   But we're going to have a round table.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.400]   It's going to be a much better set up.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.560]   I got 20 bucks that says in the first week when something blows up.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.160]   You're going to be like I wish I was in the old office.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   I bet you anything.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.960]   It's going to be on tape and I'm going to laugh my ass off.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.680]   You're going to get that scream later.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.040]   You're going to be so happy.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   Screaming Leo.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   Screaming Leo.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040]   Screaming Leo.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.920]   Now what will happen is this room is going to be transplanted.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.920]   Really?
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.920]   Transplanted.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.880]   Yeah you know that glass area that I was in that my new office.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.400]   That's exactly the same size as this is.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.040]   So we're going to take this room.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.840]   We're going to actually saw it out.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.440]   No we're not going to saw it out.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.440]   We'll see they're like.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.840]   There's that historical bill.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   We can't do that.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   The lawsuit will be built.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.840]   But we have built it.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.360]   We built Kevin to treat it match that.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.000]   And we've got you know I read curtains.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.640]   We've got that we've got you know we're basically going to duplicate this.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.960]   All the cameras all the gear that's in here will go there.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.240]   So it will be so people won't be too discombobulated by the.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.560]   Did you say your office is a classroom?
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.560]   Why?
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.560]   That's who.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.760]   I don't like people and I don't like the insurance.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.760]   It's the old school.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.760]   It's like clockwork orange.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.960]   Did you have like an old school newsroom at the LA Times where like the managing editor
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.360]   could see and then he had curtains he would close before he called and somebody to fire
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   at them.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.600]   I see hate of them which case you leave it.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   No no here's a better analogy.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.440]   Remember the cop the buddy cop movies where the two cops and they get in trouble with
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.080]   the lieutenant who's always for some reason a black guy.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.440]   I don't know why and he's in his office and he's looking at their says chest not in
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.040]   mirror you get in here and he choose them out.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040]   That's me.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.040]   See.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.040]   And I will have a fifth of bourbon in my desk.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.560]   No it's not it's not it's not the reason that I don't know why there's glass around
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.880]   it actually because it's my office.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.800]   I don't want anybody in my office because Leo is always on stage.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.000]   The room whether people are in there.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Why did we do the glass?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.920]   Oh because then people can see what's going on.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.600]   You know the whole idea is you're shooting in there you want to see stuff going on kind
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.760]   of behind the scenes and stuff.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.040]   So there's lots of long winds and you know Patrick when you set up a set you want depths.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.760]   The biggest nightmare is a 20 by 20 foot room that has walls and then you have these really
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.040]   short angles and the activity in the back and you can't possibly succeed and look Leo
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.040]   you did.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.760]   It's hard to believe that we've been six years jammed in this life.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   This little box I can't wait to get.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   It's great.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.760]   Let's move along.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.360]   We were talking about Apple and there are some other interesting stories for instance
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.640]   Apple testing an iPhone for T-Mobile.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640]   Does that seem possible?
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.480]   You know we we we haven't heard much about an iPhone 5 and I think the consensus is there
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.360]   won't be an iPhone 5 in June.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.880]   But wouldn't it be interesting we have heard that testing has been going on an A5 dual
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.720]   core iPhone right again rumors.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.960]   So the iPhone 4.5.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   I don't know what they were.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   Whatever they were.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   I don't know what.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.720]   You upgrade the processor you find that you like something crazy like a 64, 128 gigabyte
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.640]   version of it and you get half of the current user base the iPhone 4 to buy that and then
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.920]   that most of those people will buy the iPhone 5 with eventually ships before Christmas.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:30.280]   And then you have a Christmas project or a product for Apple and a dual core iPhone
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.440]   and that's an exciting product.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.720]   Well what do you think of this though?
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.600]   I mean I promise these are so easy to Photoshop.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.120]   This is from boy genius report.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.680]   It is a white iPhone.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.080]   It says T-Mobile 3G in the upper left hand corner.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   Confidential proprietary Apple's learning.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:51.920]   If found please contact 408 and then they blanked out the numbers.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.520]   Boy genius is pretty good.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.520]   Makes perfect sense.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.520]   AT&T is buying.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.040]   They have exclusive AT&T and now they're opening it up to everybody.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.040]   Why not?
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:06.240]   The Verizon deal was non-exclusive so there's nothing stopping them from opening the phone
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.440]   up to every carrier.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.440]   And it makes really good business sense because at this point they're losing overall market
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.360]   share to Android success.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.000]   What takes Android like 72 different models from 19 different manufacturers.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.080]   So yeah at this point it might as well get every single user you can on carrying an iPhone.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.560]   Is that a dropkick quick Murphy song Katie bar the door?
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.560]   No.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.560]   It should be.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   Actually let me search.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:37.120]   It just sounds like a dropkick Murphy's album is out if there are any dropkick Murphy's
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   fans out.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   Is it C?
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.480]   Is it plural or a single?
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.880]   Fans on the chat.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.840]   Dropkick Murphy's ass no apostrophe.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.840]   That's no apostrophe.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.840]   Okay.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   Somebody else.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.240]   Why is Android better than the iPhone?
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.320]   Don't get a start.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.640]   Don't start that I argue.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.960]   Okay just let me ask okay you have an iPhone.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.440]   I have both because I work in an enterprise that forces me to carry a black.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.800]   You have a blackberry that's not both.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   You have a blackberry.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.400]   This is my personal phone.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.280]   And then what about you Mark iPhone right?
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.520]   I got this for my work iPhone.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.240]   Yeah and for play.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240]   It's all I got.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.240]   Same thing.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   I like to consolidate.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   And Patrick you're an Android guy right?
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.640]   Actually I'm carrying an iPhone.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   Am you?
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   Well I've got.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.640]   Language.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.640]   I'm sorry it's Easter.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640]   Do we have it?
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   Do we have it?
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.960]   You burst into flames on camera.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.640]   This is still a five set.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.120]   Oh you all have iPhones.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.120]   You all have iPhones.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.680]   I thought you guys would have a dollar.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.840]   The dollar is worth of GPS applications running on the iOS that work.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.720]   Let's talk about the GPS applications.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.000]   Let's talk about the shall we.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Actually okay look this is actually this is a big story right?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.400]   I think it's a huge story.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.000]   I think it's the story.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Well why don't you tell us about it.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   No no no.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Let Patrick talk.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   You don't.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   It's interesting that Alister Allen.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   She's low quacious.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.440]   And Bill Martin basically Wednesday last week at the Wear 2.0 conference which is.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.080]   I'm having a vision of their campus in Sebastopol but can't remember the name of the publishing
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.520]   company who do make and everything else on the planet and all the animal books.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520]   I should remember O'Reilly.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.520]   O'Reilly.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.680]   Yeah I'm sitting here I'm like I'm sitting over your right shoulder.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.400]   You see all the animal books.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.560]   But they basically revealed that there is a for whatever reason and we should point this
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.240]   out one your carrier always knows where you are.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.440]   And anybody says your carrier should know where your phone is.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.760]   You send them to remedial math and you have a conversation afterwards.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.880]   But they know not but they don't know within 60 feet or 5 feet they know which cell you're
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   on.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   They know which cell tower you're on.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.880]   So that's a pretty big radius.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.720]   Well you know you never know what else they know that the engineers aren't talking about.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   Let's walk away from that.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   Okay.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.840]   So the researchers found two really interesting things.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.040]   There's one is that Apple is recording your location constantly.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:53.320]   Two is that it is available on the machine you back your iPhone up to.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.480]   Which means three with some very simple software which now everybody on the internet knows
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   about.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.680]   If somebody can run that on your machine they can now track where you've been.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:10.080]   Which depending on how you look at this it's either a minor deal and not really worthy
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.800]   of considering or it's incredibly potentially catastrophic thing that everybody should panic
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   about.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   I mean it was Apple doesn't bother me and the least and I'll tell you why.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.120]   First of all you knew that didn't you.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.120]   I assumed that.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:30.640]   I mean come on here's yeah my polycyte professor in college who basically said if you should
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.160]   always assume that someone is listening.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:38.400]   This is a map of Steven B. Johnson and his whereabouts for the past not one not two not
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.720]   three not four but five years now.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.480]   One of the reasons that's stored for so long is because Apple when it backs up the phone
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.960]   backs up everything so we don't know if that's an intentional move to the desktop it's just
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.960]   part of the.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.320]   Well this was added in iOS four and I went back and I looked at the.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.480]   Oh it's not in the original iOS.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.240]   They had it in iOS three but it wasn't as available.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.880]   I don't think they were creating that that unencrypted file that you could go in and actually.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.760]   Do you think it was a mistake.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.440]   No it's a log.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:17.320]   I went back and I watched the keynote for iOS four and they had.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.920]   The name of the guy who heads mobile I forget what his name is but they had a Scott forest
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.160]   all they had him on stage talking about how multitasking works how location services
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:31.600]   work and he talks about you know we need to ping for your location and we we keep a log
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.920]   of it so we can pass it on to apps so they can send push alerts based on this info.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.160]   So this was stuff that was like you know they went over it but I don't think it it really
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.320]   sunk in with anybody when they were just discussing the back end of how this works.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   And also nobody nobody probably really thought they're going to hold on to it forever.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   That's right.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.960]   You know if I'm if I fly for San Francisco Las Vegas great I'm going to get the really
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.480]   irritating sponsored ads on Google for stuff I'm not searching for when I search on Google
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.520]   Maps not that a bitter about that but you know I mean if I'm searching for a diesel gas
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.200]   station I don't want to get information on a Ford dealership in the area or something
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.680]   like that not that I don't love for it I love for it.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.760]   But it's it's fascinating that they are keeping all of the data in a single file backed up
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.440]   on your iPhone it's just bizarre.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.720]   Is it sloppy you know strange that they wouldn't encrypt it to bingo that's it and that's where
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.680]   it's that's the scary thing.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.760]   Well why is that strange?
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:33.840]   Well a Apple had told the government they point blank what about six months ago no we
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.640]   are not keeping not true not true.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.680]   In fact I have I have a document I'm going to pull up Edmark the response to Edmark you
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.880]   from July 2010 in which Apple said not only do we collect this information we tell you
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.840]   in the terms of service it is part of the deal you can opt out they said by turning off
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.560]   location services they told him that July 2010 we've known this for a long time.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.520]   You may have a while to find this I have the actual statement they made to Congress where
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.720]   they said I'll pull it up for you I got it right here.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   I'll find it.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.880]   But let me make a second point beyond that let's consider you're right Android phones
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.080]   do this too but they keep it as cash.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.760]   The big difference on the Android phone when you when you first set up an Android phone
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:18.000]   it says may we turn on location services they tell you explicitly they give you a checkbox
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.840]   and and you can opt in or not now admittedly most people probably don't notice it say yes
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.600]   and go on and forget that that happened.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.760]   How long does Android keep the data for?
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.760]   Well that we don't know.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   Well as soon as the cash fills up it's flushed and it starts to get.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.400]   So this lock and file that's on the computer now it's weird that they're saving it like
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.880]   that it's weird that they're saving it but that's why I think it's a mistake and you
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.080]   and people are thinking it's just iOS four when I looked at it it went back almost two
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.080]   and a half years.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.160]   I'm on well that's the other thing it does seem to go back farther than I was for iOS
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.120]   force made it more accessible right.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.600]   If it weren't for iOS four we wouldn't be able to run these little programs that grab
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   it and plot it.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   And so a lot of people are you know they take their privacy now for granted people say
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.800]   privacy's dead everybody's got your you know information but the fact is not if I can
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:06.280]   have your GPS information would not have been available to anyone but the police and
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.960]   it would have required a warrant.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.760]   No true doesn't require warrants.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   Ben registered.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.200]   Or a pen registered.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   Well but that's easy to get.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.200]   In effect.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.640]   But you couldn't just run a program on your husband's desktop and find out where it was
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.640]   you left.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.640]   Or if you're your wife's desktop.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   Or your wife.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.640]   A lot of the lot of the most.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.640]   Yeah don't you know.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   Thanks.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.080]   Well I'm not sure if you're going to be able to run a program on your website or your website.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   I'm not sure if you're going to be able to run a program on your website or your website.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:41.000]   I'm not sure if you're going to be able to run a program on your website or your website.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   I'm not sure if you're going to be able to run a program on your website or your website.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.160]   I'm not sure if you're going to be able to run a program on your website or your website.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.240]   Whatever what about people who are abusive what about people who have figured out a way
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.360]   to access someone's computer and take information what about stalking what about you know what
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.560]   about if you're searching for another job at the office or something like that.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.440]   Then you shouldn't be carrying a cell phone because to be honest with you this is the
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.960]   worst spy device ever invented.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.720]   It's got a microphone it's got a camera it's got GPS.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.360]   We're going to turn the thing off.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.440]   I mean if you are really paranoid turn the phone off before you go anyway.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.800]   Yeah or carry a feature phone because to be honest with you if you're carrying a smartphone
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.400]   with you you're carrying the ultimate spy device with you.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:28.160]   In fact we remember there was a phone that was made that allowed a spouse or whoever
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.360]   to turn on the microphone at any time and you'd substitute this for your wife's or
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.840]   a husband's phone and then anytime you wanted without their knowledge you could turn on
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.840]   the microphone listen what was going on.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.400]   That's a felony in the state of California without a release.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.240]   Eric Schmidt in 2009 I found this quote said it's not a thing.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.640]   Now we know Eric Schmidt back from when he was always getting in trouble.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.440]   But this is now when he was a big shot 2009 he said if you have something that you don't
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.360]   want anyone to know maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   Yeah that's that off.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   What?
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.360]   That's a BS quote.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.360]   I wouldn't hold Eric to that.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.560]   It's easy to be holier than that when you have billions in the bank.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.560]   There you go.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.640]   But that's a I mean that's he claims it's a joke.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.640]   He was joking.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.940]   It's a paper.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.080]   No it was a joke but it's a paper tie.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.560]   Eric that's why Eric's no longer CEO for a lot of reasons but one of the reasons is
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.880]   he always put his foot in his mouth.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.760]   But that's not that's a paper tiger.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:24.080]   The fact I mean people say that but the fact is if you're carrying a cell phone you should
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.280]   know that you're carrying a look.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.880]   I mean people do now know that.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.320]   You're carrying a device.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:35.960]   All of the companies that make these smart phones collect anonymized location data because
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.800]   it's how they market you know to people they say well Pizza Hut I can tell you when he's
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.520]   near a Pizza Hut would you like to know that.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.080]   People log in with four square people using Google Latitude.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.040]   I don't know does it bother you that you're that the mark let me ask you does it bother
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.160]   you that Apple was keeping track of this information.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.840]   It doesn't bother me personally.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.800]   I don't know how much of it Apple was taking and how much of it was just stored locally
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.920]   on my machines.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.760]   And I don't know if that's even clear yet Apple says they collect data location data
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:12.560]   intermittently so you know that's up to this is the July 12 2010 response to Ed Marky that
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.120]   Apple sent.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:20.120]   So we've known this is July 2010 by using any location based services on your iPhone.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.800]   This is in the terms of service.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:28.160]   You agree in consent to Apple and its partners and licensees transmission collection maintenance
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:34.560]   processing and use of your location data to provide such products and services.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.760]   And then here's apples.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.120]   This is in the terms of service you may withdraw this consent anytime by not using them.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.360]   Well but that's your choice.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.080]   There's people giggling in the back but you can turn off the GPS and you have the right.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.040]   I think what you can encrypt and you can encrypt.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.160]   Look I know Apple knows where I am at any given moment.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.720]   I know my carry knows where I am at any moment.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:57.240]   I'm a little irritated that they're cashing all their say and leaving it on my.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.560]   It's kind of my opinion that that was an accident that that I'm sure it'll be corrected
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.320]   and you know for dot whatever the operation of the operating system.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.320]   I hope I'm.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.320]   I'm.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.320]   Clearly with Patrick on this.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.440]   I can't think of a compelling reason for Apple to do it and clearly Apple would know of
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.440]   the storm.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.480]   Yeah I mean what is it you're not using an eyes.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.320]   It's going to start.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.680]   Google is kind of they have the automated.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.840]   She had the computer power.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:25.520]   They have the mapping said Google is kind of they have VW Beatles wandering around with
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.920]   obviously someone behind the wheel because basically they talked to the California DMV
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.520]   and they said they needed someone responsible behind the wheel of the self driving car.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.280]   But yeah Google is kind of okay.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.520]   I have to know I just keep I want to keep track of who's kind that is because it did
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.680]   go online didn't it the machines.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.360]   This week's kind of went online I was just curious because I didn't hear much about in
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360]   the news.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.200]   I just wanted to know maybe that's why EC2 went down just remember when you're searching
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.640]   for Skynet search on something other than Google in case Google is masking the results.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.560]   There was my mistake.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.800]   I guess here's my point.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.200]   If you carry a cell phone you probably should be kind of aware of the fact that it seems
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.440]   to know where you are at all times.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.960]   It's got a microphone it's got a camera and we know that there are apps that turn these
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.560]   things on without letting you know.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.600]   It's a spy device so I mean it's good that this came out because people know it.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.240]   I don't think Apple kept that file because Apple had some nefarious purposes for it.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.400]   I think it was a mistake and the fact that it's not encrypted points to that because
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.680]   if if they were going to keep it they'd encrypt it and the fact that it encrypted opens this
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.520]   huge security hole for other people you know stealing your location.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.600]   You just jail break the final point that I would make is that as you said law enforcement
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.920]   has been doing this all along we know that Sprint has a portal for law enforcement that
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.040]   law enforcement for a buck 50 can go and say where was Mark Millian last night and they'll
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.800]   tell him.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.520]   So it's not like law enforcement doesn't have this information.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520]   You know what?
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   Every phone.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   Right.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.520]   Yeah exactly.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:01.960]   And the wireless companies don't know this and they offer this and the standard for a
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.160]   pen register is very low because it's not considered content.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.480]   It's not you know the contents of your emails just where you are.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.880]   And I think the reason for that is because I could look out the window and see where you
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.880]   are.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.800]   I could follow you with a car and see where you are.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.080]   That information by itself isn't necessarily private information is it?
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.080]   Oh boy.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.440]   Is it where you are right now?
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.240]   You don't want anybody to know?
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.880]   Gina's not here right now.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.600]   I want everyone to not care right now.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:36.160]   For the last two years or whatever I mean I don't want that information available to
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.760]   forget spouses even enterprise like if you say well.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.640]   Well in the in the in the back up from your iPhone and barring somebody by the way that
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   is all you can do.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   Yeah that does work right.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   You can't encrypt it.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.040]   And then assuming somebody doesn't steal your phone and use fairly powerful or I should
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.520]   say you know sophisticated forensic tools to get the information out of it you're pretty
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.520]   safe.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.520]   You can't break your iPhone and get that's.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.320]   Oh yeah that's that was the advice of one expert is well just don't jailbreak your iPhone.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.720]   Because then because then it's available.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.000]   You don't let someone who's really ticked off at you jailbreak your iPhone.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.680]   Okay got it.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.680]   I think the idea behind market is sharing anonymized data is total garbage because you
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:22.400]   remember the AOL's AOL leaking the search right people were searching but they were
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.440]   anonymous strings rather than names and they were a reporter in Florida tracked a woman
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.600]   down from this data immediately.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.960]   And verify that it was her and the same is absolutely true of location.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.240]   There was a study recently that said that you know people their habits of travel are
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:46.080]   ninety six percent predictable right so if you get someone's travel data over the course
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.360]   of the year that's enough data where you can you can pretty you know where they're going
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.600]   to be accurately yeah.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.240]   So that's to the airlines.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.400]   I remember them a coupon you know they got a Hawaii for Christmas every single year.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.720]   I remember interviewing twenty five years ago a company that did this kind of thing and
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.160]   they you've told if you tell them your zip code they can tell you what kind of car you
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.360]   probably drive what kind of magazine you can.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.120]   I mean look it we're pretty pretty.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   Humans are very predictable even where your neighborhood is they can kind of pretty much
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:18.240]   tell what you buy what you eat what you do when the market or a technology company says
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.360]   no we're anonymizing this data.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   It's not very.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   It's there's nothing.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.360]   So.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.520]   And I'll drop this but should we even care about privacy anymore it shouldn't have I mean
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.120]   what we have the fourth.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.880]   I live in a glass house.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.480]   Obviously I don't work you work in a glass house.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.560]   No clearly I don't care about privacy shortly.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:45.160]   I'm missing that gene so I'm asking you as real people.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.760]   I don't care and you know Jeff Jarvis and I have this conversation because he's writing
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.120]   a book called public parts he's been a kind of an anti privacy advocate he's been saying
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.640]   well you know what what do you you know what what do you what is what is privacy what
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.880]   is it what you're very private person Patrick actually you're a good example of somebody
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.080]   who's almost the exact opposite of me.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.080]   Seriously.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.520]   Yeah we work it well yeah no I I you're very private you don't have a website you don't
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.160]   have you don't have a website you do we'll talk about that but you're so private I never
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.240]   knew about it.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.080]   It's an encrypted website.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.600]   Yeah well I don't publish a lot of pictures of my son on the web I've had people posting
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.040]   personal information I've politely asked him to keep my delete expert of Wikipedia entry
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:32.520]   because you know on some level you know there's a certain level of privacy I'd like to maintain
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:37.520]   until like if my son decides hey I want to be famous like you know great let's go make
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.080]   you famous but I'm not gonna you know and partially else because my wife is intensely
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.040]   private my wife would have the Jennifer zone where the cameras don't work so she'd come
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.880]   and yell at me and not be seen.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.920]   Well CNR CR in our chat room made that point he says okay Leo give me all the information
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.920]   and location of your daughter at all times.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   Yeah that's your children.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.080]   Yeah I wouldn't want to do that.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.120]   Is everybody want to post right now just let's all say our social security number mothers
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.720]   made name and well social security number isn't in this I mean that's not your privacy
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.720]   that's something else.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.520]   People send out a what in W9's across email right.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.520]   Right.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.240]   Somebody in the chat room says Leo turn your Blippi back on.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.480]   They want to know what you're buying.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.480]   Blippi's still on.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.280]   Oh then I guess he was.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.560]   I didn't turn it off is it is it not working I didn't turn it off let me logo look.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   Blippi is that now.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.000]   That's a ridiculous site.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.920]   That's the site that your basically tweets for your credit cards.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:30.600]   So when you buy and your iTunes account and your Netflix account so whenever you watch
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.360]   a movie or you buy some songs or you buy anything on your credit card it announces
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.640]   this in this kind of tweet stream and people follow you and to see what you're buying.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.800]   See part of the reason I keep a lot of stuff private is because I just don't want to deal
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.760]   with the response from the audience.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.120]   Not that I don't love you all but some of you hate my taste movies some of you love my
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.640]   taste movies the politics thing and like politics and religion I avoid like the plague
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   discussing in a public forum.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.480]   Because I just don't feel like having discussions about everything.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.680]   Another interesting statement from the chat room and I like this this is from H in our
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.680]   chat room.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:10.520]   He says you can care about privacy but you can't take the advantages of publicness without
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.680]   giving it up and there are advantages to being public.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.840]   I mean by posting for instance Blippi is a great advantage for people I follow who follow
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.480]   me because it's a recommendation engine.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.440]   So if I follow you Patrick and I see what movie you're watching that's of interest to
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.120]   me.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.680]   You get to choose whether you're public about that or not.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.680]   I think that I'm not saying people shouldn't have the right to choose privacy but if you
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.640]   do that you shouldn't carry a cell phone and have location services turned on and shouldn't
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.520]   be too shocked when you find out that in fact they're using that information to market.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:47.480]   I mean a number of the people by you know all the guys that are your twin people they
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.240]   were unconcerned they felt like you they were like come on you know I use four square or
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   whatever.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.000]   I found this little piece I did some research on this story.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.200]   I've got Apple telling Congress last July that all the location data that it collects
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.240]   from the iPhone is private but now according.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.600]   Well I just read the same thing and I read it earlier in terms of service which says
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.880]   we do collect it.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.120]   Private means private means.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.120]   Is what yeah you know yeah but did you read the rest of it the user consent is you're
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.240]   using location services that's your implicit consent.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:25.800]   As soon as you use location services you are according to Apple you are implicitly saying
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   okay track me.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.680]   Or is it about an implicit consent versus explicit consent.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:35.320]   Great so we put it in a checkbox and we explain it down if you want the GPS stuff to work
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.680]   we're going to track your ass.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   That's okay.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   Google does do that.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:45.800]   Is the way that Android does it is that okay with you I mean they warn you they don't
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.720]   cash they don't save it they warn you they let you know they're pretty explicit about
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:54.640]   the fact that they're selling it to marketers is that okay does that.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.640]   Is that how it should have been.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.480]   I don't think we have any choice unless you want to use a non smartphone you know if you
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.640]   want to have location services or you know GPS and applications that do interesting things
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.160]   based on where you're located.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.160]   Yeah you know what you're you're you're going to give consent on some level for that information
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.160]   in public.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.200]   In other words if you want the benefits you want the cool stuff you're going to have
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.040]   to give it up to or you're going to have to give up the information.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   And I can live with that as long as it's explicit and I get the choice.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.760]   Well it's also it's I still run into people who like well my email is private actually
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.200]   no your email is not private.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   That's right.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.160]   Your email best case scenario your email is a postcard traveling on the internet is somebody
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.400]   likely to see it no.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   But you know do you send email at work.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.520]   Yes great your company owns the rights of that email right up to the Supreme Court.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.280]   So be careful what you send on your corporate email.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.480]   So it is it is in fact opt in.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:49.280]   The problem is if you want to live in the modern world you kind of have to opt in.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.120]   Well and that's what things get interesting or or or or you just you use a separate GPS
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.120]   device from your cell phone.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.880]   Well yeah you could carry a handheld is what you do right.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   I used to do.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.080]   Do you still carry a GPS.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.040]   I actually you know for this last trip I did everything on the iPad.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.040]   Isn't that interesting.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.680]   You were the one who taught me about GPS.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.240]   Well it's because I finally found an application that does well I also used to do the alarm
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:16.720]   because a tear for for the state of Utah had a physical paper backup and two devices
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.640]   where I could do location not that I was going that far into the boonies but there's
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:26.280]   a there's some really cool applications now that do vector based topo maps for the western
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.000]   like western eastern United States.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.680]   So I could have literally all the western United States in map format on my iPad.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.680]   What do you use for that.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.040]   I will show you in just a second.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.040]   All right.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.040]   I was going to tell you.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.340]   As long as we're talking about that this policy of apples has actually worked pretty
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.640]   well for them.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.440]   Their quarterly results.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:49.680]   They earned they 24.67 billion in revenue in three months six billion profits six billion
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.640]   profit.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.680]   That's more than Google by the way.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.160]   So it's working it's working because most of that money was not from selling my personal
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.160]   information.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.000]   I don't believe from selling and I thought yeah.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.800]   Yeah and phones.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.640]   The iPod's going to yeah iPod sales are way down.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.240]   They're still making tons of money.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.480]   But they well you know it's there was a little blip in the iPad sales because iPad two came
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.280]   out but they're doing okay.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.960]   I can never sit here without remembering when you and I hosted that show and whenever the
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:22.280]   name Apple came up we used to play taps stock was a two dollars you had a button that was
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.720]   taps it would be like.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.600]   Their stock was not two dollars was it really that low.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.680]   I mean it was so low and you used to play taps.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.080]   We thought we should we should bought some of that stock.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.920]   We're journalists.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.240]   No I've never I don't think I've ever owned Apple stock four dollars was the bottom.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.400]   Was that the bottom four dollars was the bottom.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.560]   Well it was really low you play taps and we would we would recommend it.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.720]   Hey speak in a privacy.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.200]   Talk about the stockholders.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.840]   I want to talk about in a second we're going to take a break.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:55.400]   I want to talk about Dropbox because kind of a surprise there.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.000]   I've been using Dropbox for some time.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Me too.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Kind of a surprise there.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.200]   Well I don't know if I did okay the Dropbox thing is kind of interesting.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   Dropbox is okay.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.760]   Oh oh.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   Hold that thought.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:14.320]   Dropbox says what does Dropbox say before we get to that I want to tell you about freshbooks.com.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.320]   Do you do invoices?
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.520]   Yeah you do invoices.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.560]   Who doesn't do invoices?
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.680]   Do you have people to do invoices for you?
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.560]   If you've seen my operation.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:28.000]   Can I show you this is the you know I'll tell you I'm so bad in invoices I mentioned
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.800]   this before I once didn't invoice a company for nine months and they weren't too happy
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.200]   about that they didn't really want to pay me nine months later.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.200]   No.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   No.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.240]   So you got to send out the invoices on time but who likes doing that?
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   Well.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:45.960]   Amber MacArthur told me this is 2004 about freshbooks and it changed my life.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.760]   I and two million other folks have been using it since it started in 2004.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:55.480]   It is a complete this was the first really web 2.0 site I ever saw I have to say what
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:00.120]   you do is you upload your logo then freshbooks the invoicing is done very easily in a web
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.880]   form and and and simple to not like doing an Excel spreadsheet and then freshbooks emails
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.520]   the invoice to your client but one of the things I really love is that invoice has
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:15.040]   a pay him now button and they can pay you right away with a credit card or one of eleven
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.880]   online payment services.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.760]   There's also automated invoicing so if you send the same invoice every month it'll do
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.280]   it automatically it'll even collect automatically if your client says okay.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.560]   So you the whole process could be completely transparent.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.440]   Now I was invoicing companies in Canada as well as the US this was a great solution for
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.240]   me because it works in any currency I didn't have to figure out what a Canadian dollar was
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.240]   worth.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.680]   It looks good it looks professional and if for some reason you get a client that doesn't
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.320]   pay right away automatic late payment reminders you don't have to remember those either.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:51.160]   They even send paper invoices for those of you who like dead trees.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.520]   Send your client a dead tree for a small additional fee.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.520]   The tree looks at me in my stack of things.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.600]   Yeah and you and your papers they actually print stamp and mail the invoice.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.880]   I always send it both ways to those clients because that way they get the best of both
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:04.880]   worlds.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.440]   They have an iPhone app which makes it easy to track hours and put those hours right into
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   the invoice.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.760]   It's just a great solution but get ready for this my favorite part free for the first
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.360]   three clients.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.920]   So for many of us that's all we ever need.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.240]   30 day money back guarantee and all accounts there are no contracts.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:26.200]   You don't have to worry about it's just use it as you need it and I tell you what you're
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.520]   gonna love it.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:32.600]   Try it right now at freshbooks.com and once a week they have a drawing among all the people
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.600]   sign up.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.960]   All of our audience members who sign up for a birthday cake doesn't have to be your birthday.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   Just a nice cake.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.040]   A good cake.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.720]   It's a good cake.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.280]   A number of our listeners have won them.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:48.880]   Freshbooks.com you'll love your invoicing.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.520]   So Dropbox changed and this is this raise to red flag.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.840]   They changed their terms of service to say oh by the way if the federal government asks
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.240]   for your information we will give it to them.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:01.760]   That's not unusual except that they had been promising that it was encrypted.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.760]   Right.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.760]   Well it is encrypted.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   But they know the password.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.400]   Well yeah of course they have to know the password.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.840]   They were running the encryption right.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:12.800]   Well okay but for instance there are services where you own the password not them.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   True.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.800]   Like you know it was an interesting thing so I'm obviously a rabid Dropbox.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   Me too.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.680]   But I'm not putting any more of my porn on there.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.480]   Stop putting your porn Dropbox.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.960]   And part of it is really funny.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.280]   So a lot of people are like oh my god they've had access.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.200]   Anybody at the Dropbox company can read your stuff.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.200]   Well that's true.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.200]   That's what Miguel D'Egaza said.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:42.440]   And the reality is is like pretty much any other competently run company we hope right.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.920]   Because you can't really see inside of somebody else's company unless somebody you know gets
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.920]   their whistleblower on.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:47.920]   Right.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.560]   And you're like well yeah we have to be able to turn this.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.400]   Federal losses we have to be able to turn this information over.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.720]   If they have access to it.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.120]   If they have access to it.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.120]   So I use.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.120]   That's where it gets interesting.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.040]   This is what Randall Schwartz told me about this service that LaSee owns called Wala.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.040]   You know about Wala?
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.000]   Have you ever tried Wala even a little bit?
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.080]   So Wala encrypts before they send it.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.320]   In other words you have the keys and they don't.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.320]   That sounds better to me.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.440]   Yeah it's encrypted on your device.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   Right.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.880]   So on the iPhone app it just pulls in the raw data and then the app you use.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.480]   It uses processing power to encrypt.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.560]   Do you use it?
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.280]   I don't but I met with a guy at South by Southwest.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.760]   See I would use it except that everything supports Dropbox right.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.760]   Yeah Dropbox is great.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.760]   There.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.800]   Wall is huge in Europe but not so big.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.640]   One of the things I like about Wala is if you give them this is a little weird and it
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.840]   may not pass the sniff test Patrick so listen.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:45.640]   If you you can set up so you set it up so I set it up on my Mac that's running all the
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   time.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.160]   I gave it 100 gigs and I said you can use this to store other people's stuff.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.080]   And if you do that then you get as soon as they validate that you're online a sufficient
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.560]   amount of time you get 100 gigs of storage free.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.560]   Cool.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:04.080]   So you know it's I don't know it's like 20 bucks a month for my 50 gig Dropbox or 15
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.080]   bucks is expensive.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.480]   Yeah it adds up.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   But this way I get a lot of storage and now I'm storing people's stuff but they say they
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.920]   slice it in such first of all it's encrypted right.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.240]   So this is why they have to have encryption because otherwise I could see I could see
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.240]   somebody else's porn.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:22.880]   Do you guys know if sugar sink or box.net and crypto.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.880]   Ah that's a good question.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:24.880]   You'd have to read the terms.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:31.280]   On some level they all in the question is is whether or not they have access the ability
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.000]   one of our sponsors carbonite used to do it the Dropbox way with they would have the
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.160]   key and then somebody said wait a minute I'm not going to use it because I want AES encryption
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.560]   that I have the key and they did change their system so that you could.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:47.280]   I would be surprised it would be interesting to see if Dropbox rapidly changes this policy
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.280]   in the near future.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.360]   Jungle disc there's another example of a system that's much like Dropbox that you
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.720]   encrypt at your end.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.720]   So that's secure.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.920]   But Brian you can always.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   Jungle disc.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.560]   Yeah I like general disc I use jungle disc.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.160]   Jungle disc is expensive.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.160]   It is.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.760]   It doesn't it doesn't work as well for me as compared to some of the other service.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.760]   I mean you can always.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.760]   But is it more private and it's more private.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.120]   I don't know if I want to get paranoid about privacy I encrypt everything with true
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:14.760]   crypt before I put it anywhere you know and that's that's the answer is even if you're
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.760]   using Dropbox you can use true crypt.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.040]   Yeah any other you know a cryptography program that you choose.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.600]   I just I just like true.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   True crypt is free.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.600]   It's open source.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.600]   It's free.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   It's free.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:29.760]   Well and here's unfortunately the same reason that Mark still uses Dropbox is why I use
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.160]   Dropbox is every iPhone app works with it.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.440]   Everybody supports Dropbox text expanders keeps my text expansion stuff on Dropbox so
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.440]   it's everywhere.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:43.480]   I mean it's just why my friends use it so we have a share drops yeah Walla does sharing.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:49.040]   But no I don't know anybody that you know if we can only get everybody to move please
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.120]   everybody move to Walla.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.880]   It's all everyone on the show right now.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.880]   We'll see you.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.880]   Leo said to go to Walla.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:02.240]   I'm telling you right now as we're made I just wish that but see all these iPhone apps
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:08.200]   you know I use Gina Trapani wrote a really great to do list app that uses Dropbox to
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:13.120]   store the to do list so it works across all my platforms and it's a common to do list.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.960]   But it's you know supports Dropbox it's not going to support Walla.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.080]   You know a friend of mine said the other day and it was really funny.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.400]   He's like what was the name of the search engine we all use before Google.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.280]   I'll tell the best.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   What about it.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.280]   Yeah that kid that started.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.920]   So when I'm when I'm saying is you know whatever happened to them you know the war can turn
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.680]   man you know it just take a whole lot for everybody moved to a new service.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:37.440]   You know not to take anything like Dropbox guys or you know if they're listening I'd
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.920]   probably like dude don't say that.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.720]   Walla just in case we can start a grand swell I've done this before and it's never worked.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.840]   Remember when I left I left Twitter.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:53.800]   Yeah yeah this doesn't this this never works but W U A L A dot com walla you know told me
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:58.520]   about this Randall Schwartz I'll give him credit of floss weekly he he's a big walla fan.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.320]   How's Diaspora working out for you.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.320]   Yeah I love that.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:05.880]   Man watch out Facebook you're in trouble now.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:10.040]   Actually I get invitations periodically for somebody says join me on Diaspora.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.040]   Are you on Diaspora.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.360]   No I keep the invitation saying Leo is on Diaspora.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.360]   Why aren't you.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.320]   I really know on there says Leo is the only friend.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.160]   That's like the major sources.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.720]   I am I like that Leo is on my space.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.880]   I'm everybody's friend and I ask.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:29.440]   One of my guys just bought me a jungle disc account.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.440]   Thank you.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.440]   Thank you team.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:36.160]   If if Diaspora were smart.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.800]   I don't know they take the money and go to the south of France because they got a quarter
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.600]   of a million dollars from Kickstarter.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:47.040]   And obviously this is a debt this is a dead in the water right.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.800]   I don't know I mean member Linux.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.240]   Whatever happened to them.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.840]   They took over the back end of the internet.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.640]   Oh yeah that's just to this.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   Let me sign in.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.640]   I'm I'm so I've been on well great.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.960]   Wait what are the whole diaspora you missed your chance.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.960]   We're doing some maintenance.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.960]   It should be back around.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.960]   Second.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.960]   Diaspora.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.960]   Okay that's it.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.880]   Nobody's online Sunday afternoon.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.880]   That's it.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.400]   Apparently nobody is online Sunday afternoon.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.640]   If diaspora was smart they'd sell to Facebook.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.280]   Mark Zuckerberg invested in what he did but not a lot.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.280]   To the kickstart.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.280]   Yeah he thought it was funny.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.280]   Yeah he thought it was funny.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.280]   Sure he thought it was funny.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.280]   We got turned down.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.720]   I'm going to be a Kickstarter for the new studio because we're going to sell bricks with your
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.600]   name etched you'll get one.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.120]   Your name etched on it for like a hundred bucks and I thought oh this would be perfect
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.080]   kickstarter project but they didn't turn us down.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.640]   Why why kickstarter.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.800]   Why bricks.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.640]   Why bricks.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   What would you like.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   Do I get a brick.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.640]   Something more.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   Sorry only Patrick gets a brick.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.680]   Well Patrick gets a brick because he's like a founder.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.680]   You can have a brick.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.680]   You want a brick.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.680]   See the way I've done.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.680]   I was part of that decision in that logo.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.480]   I have one year old at home.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:54.480]   I could not be a founder.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:58.480]   I would have been there had I not been a squalling child in my house.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.800]   Peter Joe and Punter Joe in our chatroom says actually diasporas message says sorry Leo
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.280]   diasporas down for the day.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   We got a hit.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   We got a hit.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:15.360]   Let's talk about the the outages because this is a big deal Amazon's EC2 which is nominally
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.200]   very reliable.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   Right.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.320]   Is still down for some people isn't it.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.640]   Yeah it's what I will you know PlayStation networks down.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:28.480]   It hurt us because media fly which is our does our podcast stuff on a lot of platforms
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.920]   including Roku is on EC2 so they they've been out for quite some time.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.400]   I don't know if I because I was reading stuff and I sold and think anybody either.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:39.200]   I don't know if Amazon's really talking about what they think they're mostly you know it's
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.200]   not hacking.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.880]   It's not that it's not hacking.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:48.160]   Well you know why they say that because PSN was hacking right right but we still don't
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:52.400]   know why it's down.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.320]   Probably what's that sound you hear if you're listening to the podcast is people typing
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:01.760]   on Google trying to find why answer is I think there's a website at their plan in Virginia
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:08.920]   right at their data center in Virginia and the people who are affected were the companies
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:15.600]   that like four square and Quora companies that didn't pay for extensive backup services.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.880]   Oh so you could have spent more.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:23.320]   Right so they could have you know had redundant backups and separate data centers but they
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:29.280]   put all of their eggs right at Easter into into the basket in Virginia and your dolls
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.280]   airport and they got rocked.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:37.760]   Is this is this does this hurt the notion of cloud computing.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:42.560]   Well you could say that it this isn't real cloud computing Leo because they didn't distribute
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.040]   it through multiple locations on the cloud.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:48.920]   But that's exactly I mean this is how cloud computing is probably going to be done right.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:53.200]   You're going to think you're in 27 locations and actually your low cost bid puts you in
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.200]   one.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.680]   Yeah yeah I don't know you know it's it's kind of it's really funny because like for CDN's
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.040]   look at this this didn't take long.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.760]   Here's an ebook called easy to enable the complete guide to staying airborne when cloud
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.520]   computing becomes turbulent.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.200]   Somebody's already written an ebook.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.200]   Well.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.560]   Because it's an ebook and you paid a hundred dollars for it.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.080]   I love how fast that happens.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.640]   That's amazing.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.680]   He's kind of evil in a really cool way.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.120]   Yeah instant publishing.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.560]   So you don't think that this hurts the reputation of cloud computing.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.400]   Well you know we've been watching this for like how many decades everything's going to
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.400]   be on the server.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.720]   I know it's going to be on the desktop everything's going to be on local everybody's going to
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.720]   be on the cloud.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:41.320]   I mean you know because on some level you know I don't know it's what's weird is that
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.000]   it's still broken.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.880]   I mean this was Larry Ellison's grand vision right in nineteen.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.880]   You worked for this company.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.880]   I think Nick.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.880]   Nick.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.200]   Nick the new internet computer company which is the NC.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.440]   In nineteen eight he was saying everything eventually will be and he didn't use the word
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.880]   cloud because that word didn't exist yet but it was it won't be local you won't have
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:07.360]   to have a hard disk and you know and we built a company around this and there were no cloud
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.120]   apps and of course the company.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.360]   I mean that was ten years ago.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   I bought one of those little eight dollar you know.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360]   Did you buy our Nick?
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   Nick.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.360]   Did you.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.360]   Yeah I got up there was a pile of them at Defcon for like five years.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.360]   They're five dollars now.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.360]   Well this is five years ago you know.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.360]   Do you have one Gna still?
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.560]   Yeah I have like ten more nicks on the garage.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.560]   Could you give me one?
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   They were a hundred dollars.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.360]   Can you give me one for our studio?
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360]   Yeah absolutely.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.360]   I'll give you a brick.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.360]   The bricks were more.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.360]   I did too.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.360]   The brick works.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.360]   Hey my thing still works.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   What do you plug it in?
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.360]   It was a Linux based system.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   Oh it was a Linux based system.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.360]   Well it was a Linux based system.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.360]   That's right now.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.360]   Easy too.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.360]   You're directly into Internet Explorer.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.360]   Oh there you go.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.360]   That's a good design.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.360]   Well that's all it did.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.360]   Was it went on the Internet?
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.360]   So it's a what it is is Chrome OS.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.360]   It's Chrome OS before there was a Chrome OS.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.360]   But this was in 2000.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.360]   So there were no apps there was no word processor.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.360]   There's nothing anybody can do that.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.360]   Bandwidth for it I'm sure.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.360]   People couldn't.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360]   Well there are dials.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360]   The company it would be.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.360]   That was probably the idea.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.000]   You have a thousand people and you want to make sure they can't browse the Internet.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.560]   Then you have these cheap little devices with a monitor and a single application it runs
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.800]   and they can't hack around it and they can't get into it unless you've got like one our
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.800]   core Linux geek.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.640]   We were able to sell this stuff internationally into verticals.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.800]   But you know to Americans they'd go what?
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.800]   No Windows?
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   No hard disks?
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.800]   That's not a computer.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   $199.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.720]   The cheapest PC is 700 at the time.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720]   But there was no cloud.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.800]   And I used to sit in Scott McNeilly's office at Sun and beg him to finish up Star Office.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.800]   And he would say yeah yeah I'll get to it but I'm going to a hockey game.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   Like you know my company's a.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   You were processing.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.800]   Yeah we.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.080]   Star Office has kind of gone through a little rocky transition.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.840]   Apparently Oracle's not real.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.080]   It's kind of come around hasn't it?
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.080]   It's an Oracle product now.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.480]   Well I mean you know they're not real fond of it.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.480]   I still Larry.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.480]   Bye.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.840]   And a million ways and a million pieces.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.360]   So here's the latest if you go to.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360]   How is here to stay?
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.520]   I believe what you I'm with you.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.760]   If you go to status.8wst@amazon.com.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.920]   Maybe the clouds here to stay but but the Amazon's EC2 instance in North Virginia.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.680]   Instance connectivity latency and error rates.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.640]   It's still down.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:33.840]   We're continuing to recover remaining stock EBS volumes in the affected availability zone.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.800]   This is Skynet.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.400]   And the pace of volume recovery is now steadily increasing.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.840]   So it's interesting to read this because I don't know what it means but I suppose somebody
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.240]   doesn't.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.880]   It's interesting that it took so long to get this back.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.600]   Let's say here.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.600]   What about PSN?
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.600]   They were hacked.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.600]   Well they.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.600]   The PlayStation network.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.520]   Well the anonymous group that they thought hacked them.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520]   It wasn't anonymous.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.200]   They weren't they didn't do it.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.040]   But I guess why would you admit to it if you did do it.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.920]   I say anonymous is pretty big on.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.080]   Are they anonymous?
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.080]   Do they typically admit?
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.080]   They wouldn't bring the PSN.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.080]   They shouldn't call themselves anonymous.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.960]   Why would they bring PSN down though?
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.440]   Was there something going on that we don't know.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.280]   Together we're all these big game releases this weekend.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.120]   We've got a guy Jacob Lopez and he sent me the very first story on this.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.280]   It's down the PlayStation network is now it's going to be down all through the holiday weekend.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.560]   Okay so Sony blog that it turned off the network.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.560]   That's what we did.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.560]   It's not down.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:35.720]   So on Wednesday because we because there was an intruder alert so that they were being
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.200]   hacked.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:43.840]   They called it an external intrusion on our system in order to conduct a thorough investigation
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.680]   to verify the smooth and secure operations of our network services.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.880]   See they're afraid that they who knows what was put on there and what they don't want
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.400]   to do is spread that to machines.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:57.400]   Now 47 minutes ago from the AP Sony says they're rebuilding PlayStation network.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400]   That sounds.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.400]   That sounds good.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.400]   Intense.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.680]   And apparently they're it's interesting because they're using Minecraft to do it.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.680]   So I thought that was kind of interesting.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.680]   [Laughter]
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.680]   Mine's kind of hard.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.680]   Mine take them a little while.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.880]   Do you play Minecraft?
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.880]   Anybody?
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.400]   I'm trying to avoid Minecraft because it's the kind of thing I probably would.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.400]   I was watching a YouTube video.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.400]   When you have kids in a house small kids.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.240]   So there's a YouTube video of a guy who built an automatic wheat harvesting machine in
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.480]   Minecraft.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:30.440]   This thing it must if it were real world be like acres is like he's got pumps and conduits
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.840]   and water he pulls a lever and water runs down and then it goes through fizzips and
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:40.680]   feel and it's like this elaborate thing and I'm thinking how long did that take?
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.760]   How long did it?
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.760]   I don't know.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.160]   Well if he spent as much time working on it as you do podcasting about 30 hours a week.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.160]   I think you must I think you'd have to spend it up to be like a full-time job.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.920]   How many people do you know like to be like yeah I was playing World of Warcraft like
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.920]   seven hours.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920]   Yeah that's very common.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:59.240]   I've been playing Portal 2 at least in Minecraft you're you're you're not running around sort
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.640]   of a small dwarf and you know whatever cavern you're killing things and finding gold.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.760]   Yeah but it's eight bit it's weird looking.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.760]   Everything's weird.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.200]   And then somebody apparently built a working arithmetic logic unit.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   That's pretty cool.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:19.400]   A working one in Minecraft.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400]   I do like Portal 2.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.800]   Portal 2 does come to an end however unless you play cooperative then you have to do it
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.800]   again.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800]   You play that stuff.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.800]   Wow.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.800]   I love Portal 2.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:30.800]   Portal 2 is awesome.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.800]   What you looking at there?
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.560]   That's when they posted that on the PlayStation blog that we're rebuilding everything.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.560]   They're rebuilding it all.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.560]   They said they're rebuilding everything on April 22nd.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.160]   Yeah involved rebuilding our system to further strengthen our network infrastructure.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:47.800]   Oh this task is time consuming we decided it was worth the time necessary to provide
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.520]   the system with additional security.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.520]   Oh that's scary.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.960]   It's like we just didn't have a secure system so we're making it so scary.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.320]   It was supposed to launch this week on PS3.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.720]   Oh is that the suite?
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.720]   Oh man.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.880]   There was a bunch of stuff that was supposed to launch on PS3.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.800]   Portal 2, Mortar Combat and the Steam integration on PS3.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.320]   The new Mortar Combat.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   Mortal Kombat.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.000]   I'm sure we'll sing that.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.800]   And of course there's like 4,363 comments.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   Thanks.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.280]   Hope this gets fixed.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.840]   I appreciate the update.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.200]   So Creedra had to narrow down a little more time for me.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.200]   Sad face.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.200]   Can you not play a PS3?
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.320]   Can you play PlayStation Live?
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.480]   You know whatever they call it?
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.480]   No.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:35.120]   I tried to get on this morning to watch Netflix and it kept flashing like you must log in.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.400]   So you have to like you know hit cancel a couple times to actually watch anything.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.280]   Yeah I think Sony's.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.240]   Also trying to trick us there with them.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:50.680]   You know related but sad story.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.000]   If you like CDs you should feel sad.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   Is he the guy?
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.600]   Well he was kind of the champion for CD technology.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.040]   Although Phillips invented the CD but he was the one who put it on the map.
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:07.360]   He was a chairman of Sony from 82 to 95.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.360]   Sony music.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.720]   He put together Sony Pictures.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.720]   Sony Computer.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.960]   Really the PlayStation came out of that.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.400]   One rich Japanese dude.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.360]   He replaced all those cassettes with CDs.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.280]   Wow that's sad.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   It's sad.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.600]   I mean as a CD's 9 years leaving I mean it'll seem.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.280]   Well speaking of Piter's Max Matthews died this week.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280]   Who's that?
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.040]   You know who Max Matthews was?
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.040]   Yeah Max Matthews.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:39.080]   Max Matthews was the guy at Bell Labs who wrote the original program to synthesize music
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.280]   on a mainframe computer.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   No kidding.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.360]   This is the obituary segment of this.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.160]   I've got one too.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.160]   Who's dead?
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.800]   This could happen more often.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.360]   We should start doing this.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.360]   Who's dead?
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:58.080]   It's kind of like you know okay so music geeks like from the 80's or 90's you probably
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:04.400]   heard of like Max like OP Max, C sound came out of Matthews work but if you've seen here
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.880]   it is the New York Times.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   So the implications of Matthews early research reached popular audiences through the 1968
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   film 2001 A Space Odyssey.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880]   Oh wow.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.880]   Which the Hal 9000 computer sings D.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880]   D.D.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.560]   Yeah but he was that was one of the really early successes of synthesized music was they chose
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:28.240]   to and it's an amazing programming feat in the late 60's to program the mainframes to
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.080]   synthesize a voice an artificial voice singing that.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:38.560]   That's why they that's why that became the song as the computers coming down in 2001.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:47.080]   So that's very interesting you know I mean the notion of the voice synthesis synthesization
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.720]   can you say that for me please.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.720]   Synthesisation.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.720]   I don't think it's even a word.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.440]   I've been playing a band called Dream Theater and they've.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   I love Dream Theater.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.280]   They use voice synthesization.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   You walk.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.760]   They do wild wild stuff.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.320]   They're progressive heavy metal.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.160]   Progressive heavy metal and Jordan Rudass is somebody I've interviewed.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.160]   I like them.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.160]   I like them.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.560]   They're a truly our trained pianist but their music is.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.400]   It's like classical Metallica.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   It is like classical Metallica.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.960]   It's gorgeous and they've got an app now called Morph Wiz.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.880]   It's on the iPad.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.920]   I highly suggest it.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:25.400]   But without guys like him that recently died I mean none of this stuff we wouldn't see
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.400]   it.
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.120]   By the way Penny Arcade has their response to the PSN outage.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.120]   Oh no.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.120]   There's right there.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.120]   Dear PlayStation.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.600]   How come I can't play any of my games online?
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.600]   More like Yawn Line.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.880]   Single players where the real action is.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.000]   Why play with a boring weirdo loser when you could play with yourself?
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   Well I play with a weirdo loser when you can.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   Thank you Penny Arcade.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.760]   I do that because I know you're a big Penny Arcade.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:54.760]   I love Penny Arcade.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.760]   It makes me happy.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.760]   Penny Arcade.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.840]   You know I still play Doom.
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.880]   I still have an old version of Doom.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880]   What?
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.880]   Are you playing with your phone or on your computer?
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.880]   On a computer?
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880]   I've got an old version of Doom.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.400]   And I found a version of Pong for my little boy.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:20.880]   So this is the actual original Daisy Daisy from 1961.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.880]   And IBM 7094.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:32.600]   This is the first computer music synthesis.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.200]   Apparently there was an Australian computer in '57.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   Oh come on.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.200]   Are you kidding me?
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   No I went on to Wikipedia.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.200]   I was like that's amazing.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.600]   I saw that we need to mention in the podcast before people email it.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.400]   I've got the most intelligent man in my life here.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400]   Patrick.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.400]   That's incredible.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.400]   It's multifonic.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.400]   How are you fun?
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.400]   1961 is it?
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.400]   Everybody sing.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.400]   Oh love love.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   Oh love love of you.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.400]   I can't afford a carriage.

[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:14.300]   You know, it was just a strange thing.
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.300]   We do have a dental show. It's called "Floss Weekly."
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.300]   You could be on that.
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:20.300]   You should put me on because I've never had a cavity.
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.300]   I just have some bizarre bacteria in my mouth.

[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.300]   I have never been so afraid in my life.

[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.300]   It's time for...
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:50.300]   Three.
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:51.300]   Thank you, John.
