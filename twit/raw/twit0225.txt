[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.840]   all the week's technology news, the pre-Christmas edition.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.360]   That's why I have a little Santa hat on my microphone.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.720]   And that's why Santa is in studio today, John C. Devorak
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.600]   from Channel Devorak.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240]   Ho, ho, ho.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.240]   He's wearing the Finlay orange.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.600]   Finlay.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.440]   What is Finlay?
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.600]   It's in two football champs from last year.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.040]   And I see we have some bold t-shirts that somebody--
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.760]   --listeners brought by for you.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.760]   And a bunch of t-shirts for the upcoming Boise State TACU game,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.000]   which is, by the way--
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.840]   Pull that microphone right up into your--
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.000]   I know you're new to the broadcast business,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.400]   but just stick that thing in your face.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.480]   I feel like being a little Patrick Norton today.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.440]   Yeah, that just--
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.160]   You said a little while I like it.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.520]   So anyway, so they have this crappy game that they're--
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.720]   I mean, I'm sure the game will be exciting.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.800]   So, Boise State versus--
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.280]   Yeah, but these two teams should have been--
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.360]   One of them should have been put up against Florida,
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.240]   or some team that showed them that the BCS has issues.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.840]   Anyway, so thanks for the t-shirts we ever brought them by.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.360]   Who was it?
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.400]   And I know I forgot their name, and then I don't think
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.840]   it's on there.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.200]   And what else did you get there?
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.120]   What's that thing in front of you right there?
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.040]   A pie.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   I have a pie.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.960]   A pie?
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.880]   No, that's true.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.720]   Ian brought a pie.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.360]   Thank you, Ian, for bringing a pie.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   I have a pie.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   You swab on the chair.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.880]   I also do Leo got me a cardboard box that I can use for shipping.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.520]   You know what they say?
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   If you don't like the taste of cardboard, don't eat the box.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.200]   Here, nothing else.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.880]   There is something in it that's an SSD drive, the Intel X25M,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.760]   the top of the line.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.240]   So, that is you're coming to this place.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.280]   Yeah, you actually get garbage.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.200]   Check it out.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.040]   Check it out now.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.840]   160 gigs.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.960]   Super fast.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.040]   You know, we're really happy to have Robert Herron back.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.400]   I was at John's party.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.240]   John had a Christmas party.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.160]   Was that a Christmas party?
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.240]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.680]   And so happy to have Robert Herron here.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680]   I saw him at the party.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.600]   I said, Robert, haven't been on ages.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   Always a pleasure.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.640]   Now, do you still do the home theater show on revision 3?
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   Or is that over?
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   Oh, no.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   We're still doing HD Nation every week.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.120]   I think it airs on Tuesdays every Tuesday.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   You get a new episode.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.440]   And on top of that, I'm just busy doing contract work for different companies and traveling
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   around and doing my thing.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.760]   It's great to see just back from Korea with Samsung.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.200]   Yeah, that was awesome.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.800]   I have to admit just watching the scale of production and how the company works from the
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   inside out and how LCD TVs are made.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   That's cool.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.760]   And just seeing some of the latest technologies for the next couple of years out too.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.240]   It was just, it was mind blowing really well.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   Well, it's great to have you back.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.640]   Herronfidelity.com is the website to go to.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.200]   We'll talk about big screen TVs and get ready for CES too.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.600]   Also with us today, Mr. Brian Brushwood from the NSFW show.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   Hey, Brian.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   I'm doing well.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   How are you doing?
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   You didn't even ask me how I was doing.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.080]   I just had to tell you right off the bat because I assumed I predicted.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.680]   I said, how you doing, Brian?
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   Did I not?
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   I believe I did.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.120]   I think I felt it psychically.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.520]   And I just instantly answered how I did it.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.440]   Well, I felt bad because we kicked you to the ground last night and I just want to make
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.200]   sure you were able to get up.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.040]   You curb stumped scam school with your best video podcast award at podcastoward.com and
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.440]   I'm not bitter at all.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440]   Congratulations.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.880]   You know, I didn't do it on purpose.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.280]   That's not, it wasn't like I was out to get you or anything.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.560]   I was collateral damage and that's totally fine.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.520]   Now that I'm on the Twit team, I couldn't be happier.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.440]   Yeah, that's what you have to say, isn't it?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.160]   I, you know, this is a, Todd Cochran does this, a geek news and he's done this every
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   year.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160]   He's just great.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.520]   I really appreciate him doing that.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.320]   And I felt bad because I had to take off.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.640]   I was there for the first award, which was the Gizwiz won Best Comedy.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   So thank you.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   Although he didn't pronounce it Gizwiz.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   No, no.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.640]   He had an alternate pronunciation.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.640]   Gizwiz.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   I wasn't going to say it.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.640]   Yeah, that's what he was.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   Gizwiz.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.200]   And I did actually correct him as you, when I got on Skype with him, I said, I think that's
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   wrong.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   It's not the Gizwiz.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   It's the Gizwiz.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   So he won Best Comedy.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.280]   I think we won Best, we won Best Video, which is ironic because they're not even really
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   a video podcast.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   It is huge.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.240]   Oh, I guess I noticed that, didn't I?
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240]   I think a few people do.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.640]   Well, we will be in a minute or two.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.040]   So that'll be okay.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.440]   Munchcast won for Best Food.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.520]   It's like winning the Nobel Peace Prize in advance of actually doing anything.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.960]   Yeah, that's what I think of it as.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.560]   I'm like, I like Barack Obama in that way.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.040]   Munchcast won for Best Food.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.720]   And that's kind of ironic because we canceled that show about six months ago.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.520]   But that's, we're bringing it back now.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.520]   Whoops.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.680]   And, and I think in the technology science, we, we split the vote a little bit.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.440]   Plus weekly was nominated, should have won, but security now once again, plucked the prize
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.040]   best type night and should have won, but security now is one.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.040]   The Munchcast won.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.040]   Munchcast won Best Food.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.040]   Is it good?
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.040]   Who Joe?
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   It's not even on.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.880]   We're going to bring it back.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.880]   And now.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.880]   I just wanted to award.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.080]   And now we're also really happy to welcome.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   Thank you, Brian.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   It's good to have you here.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   Want to welcome one.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080]   Of course.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   Oh, no, I'm very excited.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   Jason Calicanos, who has some good news.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.080]   What's the best news for Jason?
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.080]   I'm not a prize of his own this week.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   Hey, Jason.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.080]   Oh, oh, cricket.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   Oh, oh, cricket.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   Jason, you muted.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.080]   Yes.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.080]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   You were sitting on your mute.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.080]   Oh, the old DSP 400 got me again.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.080]   Oh, man.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   We're getting new ones.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.080]   We're not using those anymore.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080]   Oh, we're not.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.080]   No, I'll send you a better one.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.080]   I'll send you another one.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080]   You just said it to me.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.080]   What a guy.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.080]   A guy.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.840]   Yeah, we had a big, big news this week, a new edition of Mahalo launched.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.080]   I had my wife gave birth to our daughter.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.680]   Which was the most amazing experience of my life.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680]   Isn't that great?
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.880]   Tuesday morning, 28 hours of labor.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:59.160]   And it was, if you take every moment in my life, like that was amazing and put them together
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   and times it by 10, like half of the experience of when my daughter, you know, arrived, it
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   was, I'm going to get teary eye just thinking about it.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.560]   I cried for the first hour or she was like in the world and was like literally shaking.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.280]   I was so like happy and just in awe of like women and what they're capable of doing.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.080]   Like my wife is just amazes me now.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.080]   Wow.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.800]   Yeah, that's hard work, not to mention excruciatingly painful.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.000]   Well, at least all the hard work's over now.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   See easy going.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.160]   Yeah, just coast, just coast.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.680]   And if you can do anything to keep your kid away from this guy, Brian Brushwood, my advice
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.680]   do please.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.680]   I've got two girls of my own.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.160]   I got a five year old and a two year old.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   Are they breathing fire yet?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.080]   But what's great about Christmas is for the first time I'm already teaching my daughter
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.240]   how to lie to keep secrets from lying so that your surprises are ruined.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.760]   It's a heartwarming moment when the when daddy teaches the kids to lie.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.240]   Something we all look forward to.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.280]   The fun thing about having kids and I think you'll probably agree, Brian, I know everybody
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.000]   else who's had kids here is you get to be a kid.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.800]   Again, you get to go to the Disney movies, you get to play with toys, you get to go to
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.600]   amusement parks without any apology.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.200]   Homework seems like stupidly easy.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.760]   Like I'm so awesome.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.760]   Red goes here.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.760]   Yeah, right.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   It's through fourth grade, then it gets hard again.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.760]   Trust me.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.760]   Trust me.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.600]   Any advice from, let's see, Robert, you're not a father, I know, but I know John and
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.680]   I are.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.240]   Any advice for this?
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.400]   For Cali Canis?
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   Document everything.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   I don't know.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.360]   Enjoy every second of it because it's such a blast to go back and look at your pictures
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.600]   and your videos, which is that's the best thing about the iPhone, in my opinion, is to
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.960]   capture all those little spontaneous moments of pure joy throughout your life.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.320]   And then you can embarrass the kids with the stuff much later.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.320]   Very useful for teenagers.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.600]   I got naked butt pictures.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   You'll be home at five.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.360]   I got actually some classics.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.840]   So you want to make sure to collect a lot of photos that can be used for blackmail in
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   the future.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   You're going to need it when they're about 12.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.640]   It's always good to plan for teenage them.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.080]   And when their teenagers get a really neat to pull out the heavy, I mean, don't do this
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.080]   to poor Jason.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.600]   They won't be, she won't be a teenager for quite a while.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.160]   You got to plan in advance.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.920]   It's faster than you think.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.840]   People tell me this is having a girl as a great deal for the dad because they just
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.640]   absolutely love their dads.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.880]   And then when they have a problem, they go fight with their mom.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.960]   It could be, but it's not been my experience.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   My daughter hates me.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.400]   Well, you're one of the rare because most of my, I have to say, I had what Jason said
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   is what's happening with me.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.960]   Yeah, she's not a daddy's girl.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.200]   My daughter, Abby, she's not.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   No.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   But I love her.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.760]   We get along really well and we have great intellectual conversations, but she runs
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.640]   to mama if she's, if she knows.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.080]   You've been usurped.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.080]   I've been usurped.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.080]   It's true.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.080]   Interesting.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.080]   So there's really no guarantee, Jason, you don't know what's going to happen.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.600]   That's kind of the fun of it.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.120]   I'm totally looking forward to it and I appreciate all the awesome.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:50.400]   I mean, so many people tweeted and Facebooked me and flowers and people sent gifts.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.880]   Like I've never met people and they just sent gifts.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.960]   It was just so touching.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:59.600]   I mean, really nice and just a lot of the Twitter fans posted on my blog and stuff.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   I really appreciate it.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   And we've met a lot to my wife and I.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.960]   You know, Jason, I just had to say really quick.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   Let me introduce you first.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   Jason Howell is on the line for Buzz Out Loud.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   Hello.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.960]   Hey, Jason.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.440]   Sorry, I had to butt in just because this was totally on topic that when you had your baby
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.600]   girl, I started getting all of these Twitter responses saying, Hey, congratulations.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   You had your baby.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.480]   I had to deflect my wife pregnant too.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.480]   Tell them to send gifts.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.200]   I should say the other Jason is the one.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   The other Jason, exactly.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.560]   I'm like, Nope, I'm not at Jason.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.280]   This is your first also, Jason Howell?
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.440]   Yeah, it is.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.440]   And when's your wife do?
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   She do February 4th.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   I'll see you.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   We'll be happy to talk to you.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440]   We'll be happy to talk to you.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.920]   Well, so I was silent because I was scribbling down notes that you guys were talking about.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.920]   And they scared the crap out of me.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.560]   I think the dads will agree it's the most exciting, wonderful, hardest thing you'll ever do in
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   your life.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.120]   It really is probably, I haven't, Jason probably has more experience.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.800]   Jason Calicanis with being an entrepreneur.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.160]   That's probably very difficult.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.040]   This is kind of like entrepreneurship in a biological field.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.160]   Actually, it's more like franchising if you think about it.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   Totally.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   Franchising the old, the old Jean pool.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.360]   Anyway, it's a wonderful thing.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.360]   Congratulations, Jason.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   That's really great.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.560]   This initial cost long-term benefit when they take care of you.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   Right.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   Oh, welcome back.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.560]   Put them to work.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   My kids have already explained they're not taking care of us.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.800]   So they say you better be saving because we're not taking care of you.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   That's okay.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   You're going to be fine.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   Howl.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   I'm trying to take care of myself.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.040]   Aussie's going to take care of me.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.520]   Howl is on the line.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   I'm going to call you Howl.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.840]   So to distinguish you from Calicanis.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   Howl is on the line.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   Mr. Howl.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.840]   First and howl.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.840]   Well, first and first.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.840]   He's on the line.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.720]   Because yesterday he touched something few of us have touched before.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.640]   Actually, I'll do you one better on Dad.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.320]   So I guess it's not true though.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.320]   It's not something on Friday.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.880]   You touched something on Friday that we can only dream of touching.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.600]   Does he have something to do with Tiger Woods?
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.600]   Nothing to do with Tiger Woods that I know of.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   What is it?
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.400]   Actually, we can make a little game out of this.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.720]   What is it that Jason Howl touched on Friday that will change our lives forever?
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   That remains to be seen.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   Organic?
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   Or is it?
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.960]   Yeah, is it alive or mineral vegetable?
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.960]   That's it.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.960]   Mineral.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.280]   If you consider Android as being alive, then yes.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.120]   It's the Nexus One.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.880]   It's the long rumored and now proven to exist Google phone.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880]   They handed these out.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.800]   I understand this week to Googlers.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.160]   This is some say this is the phone Google wanted but wasn't able to get from Motorola
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   or HTC.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.760]   HTC designed it for Google.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.800]   It's called the Nexus.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.040]   I've seen pictures.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.640]   It looks like a little bit like an iPhone.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.080]   I mean, it's a flick looking device.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.200]   It was a dinner with a bunch of friends and of course...
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   Keyboard?
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   No keyboard.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   No keyboard.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   That's how it should be I think.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.320]   It has the little scrolly ball at the bottom but pretty much the rest of the face of the
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.760]   phone is all touchscreen.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.160]   Having used now the keyboards on both the N900 and the Droid, I think an on screen keyboard
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.520]   if done right is a better choice.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.280]   I like Android's on screen.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.320]   I mean, I have the Droid and I pretty much 99% of the time I'm using the on screen keyboard.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.600]   I rarely ever pull out the fly down.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.560]   Well, that's also because the Droid has the worst keyboard in the world.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.120]   Yeah, it's a little fussy for me.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.120]   My fingers I think are just a little bad.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.760]   How much is the most beautiful thing you did in Android?
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   This was...
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.760]   I think you're using mine.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.760]   I think you're using the N900.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   Remember you liked the N900 keyboard.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   I'm...
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.360]   I tell you I'm spoiled on the auto correction from non-physical keyboards.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.960]   It's like I'm ready for real keyboards to use kind of mash buttons that are generally
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.120]   where you're trying to type and it just puts everything together correctly.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.840]   As long as that I'm happy.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.840]   That's one thing.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.840]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.800]   That's one thing that's easily implemented but not usually implemented on hardware keyboards.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   I don't know why.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.160]   Yeah, I don't understand that either.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.480]   So tell us more about it, Jason.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.960]   Well, I mean, you know, I was at this dinner looking across the table.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.560]   This guy was very cagey with this little phone that was in his hand.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.600]   And I mean, the first thing that struck me was just how small and compact it looked.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.880]   It definitely for at first glance looked like an HTC phone.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.120]   Immediately thought it was one of the new HTC phones that I hadn't seen in person.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.320]   I'd only seen photos or whatever because I was only really looking at the back.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.360]   So I asked him if it was an HTC phone and of course he looked up and he's like, "No,
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.840]   this is actually the new Google phone."
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.920]   Oh man, this guy is playing you like it's like, "Oh, don't pay no attention to this
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.760]   phone I'm using here."
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.480]   He was really keeping to himself about it.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.120]   But the second he said Google phone, my eyes lit up.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.560]   You could have heard a pin drop.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.560]   He stopped talking.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.560]   He's like, "You're not a blogger, are you?"
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.920]   Little late for that.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.000]   But anyway, so I talked him into letting me kind of play around with it for a couple
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   of minutes.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.440]   I didn't really get a whole lot of time with it.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.520]   But enough time to see that it's a pretty slick device.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.480]   The screen was super sharp, just really clear.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:56.240]   It had some animated backgrounds that I hadn't seen on my droid anyways.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.840]   And just kind of dug into the system kind of settings a little bit to make sure that it
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.880]   was 2.1 and all that kind of stuff.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.840]   Now you've used a droid, so you're a perfect person to take a look at this and tell us,
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.760]   how's this differ from the droid?
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:16.080]   Yeah, I mean, like I said, I didn't get enough time with it to really see the difference.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.880]   What I had heard about the new Google phone is that Google was saying, "Well, this is
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.120]   going to be the actual real Android and the things that are out there won't do."
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.520]   Well, they also said we don't want to undermine our partners.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.520]   Totally.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.680]   So when I'm looking through it, I'm kind of looking at the apps and everything, trying
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.760]   to find something in there that really set it apart.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.040]   And when I was scanning through, I mean, I recognized all the icons.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.440]   It really looked very similar.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.480]   The only differences that I really saw were very cosmetic differences in the OS.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:51.760]   The little gray slider that pulls out the home screen and hides it on the front screen
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.040]   of the Android OS.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.440]   And that was replaced with a flashy little outline trace of a house that kind of had
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.440]   laser edges on it.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.120]   I mean, just little cosmetic things that I was able to figure out.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.680]   And it was really snappy when I was clicking through it, it had really good response time.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.920]   Five megapixel camera according to sightings on Flickr of pictures taken by the Nexus
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.920]   1.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   Actually, on Google's Picasa, not Flickr.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.320]   Five megapixel camera with a lens that's probably a two buck lens.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.200]   That's why I like this Nokia N900 because they put a Carl Zeiss lens on it.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   Even though the thing is the size of a pin.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:38.520]   Well, it's a high F stop.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   It's actually a pretty good camera.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   It's pretty good pictures.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.280]   But Nokia has always done good camera phones.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.520]   I think the N900 is on a par with the N95, which is also five megapixels.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.200]   The truth is, even though I have a droid, which is supposedly five megapixels, doesn't
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   look that great.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.560]   Now, the pictures on the droid don't look that at all.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.120]   I keep using the iPhone with the lower megapixels just because there's better pictures and
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.520]   there's more capability built into the phone's application.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.520]   Completely.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.600]   I mean, all in all, I'd say at the end of the experience, I was kind of asking myself,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.680]   "Okay, I have the droid.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.600]   I've had it for, I don't know, a month and a month and a half now.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.480]   From what I've seen of this, is it really enough?
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.000]   Am I regretting my purchase right now?"
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And I mean, yes, it's a prettier phone, but really when it boils down to it, it was
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.400]   an unlocked phone and the guy that had it had plugged in his AT&T SIM card.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.720]   And that's kind of where it lost me.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.400]   It's like, the reason I got the droid is because it's on Verizon and I don't want to
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.880]   deal with AT&T network.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.320]   I want to be on Verizon.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.080]   I've been there for years.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.320]   And so if that's where this phone is dwelling, then it's still not, you know, it's still not
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   a lock for me.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.240]   They bring it to Verizon or they make a model that works on Verizon's network.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.240]   I'm there.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.240]   You agree, Brian?
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.960]   Yeah, that's the first thing I thought to me when it said that it was a GSM fault.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.760]   And I guess, well, T-Mobile or AT&T, and it's like, what's the difference?
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.600]   I was shocked that it wouldn't have Verizon support.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.000]   But I've got, I've got two questions.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.200]   First of all, number one, when are we going to stop calling everything an iPhone killer?
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.880]   And when does the iPhone stop being the benchmark for everything?
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.400]   When do we judge phones on their own merit?
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.840]   And number two, seriously dude, is this an iPhone killer?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.480]   Oh, nice.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.360]   I just got a pen.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   It's got a stylist.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360]   He's looking at the N900.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   This means it's going to be lost.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.600]   No, first thing I did is lose that.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.000]   And then my wife found it in the wash or something.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.200]   You're right, the stylist on the N900.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.440]   N900 is a resistive screen.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.160]   I think it's got to be capacitive touch if you're going to compete with the iPhone.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.400]   I think here's one thing that I do think that is happening with both the Droid, the N900,
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.920]   probably with this Nexus.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.320]   The screen quality has improved so much that the iPhone is starting to look like a crappy
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   screen.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.120]   Yes, the iPhone has kind of a blurry look to it when you can start to have that side
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   with something like the Droid.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.120]   Or is it on the end?
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.800]   That's not going to take much to fix.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   Well, they got to fix it.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.400]   But that's amazing that we're here now.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.120]   I realized that we finally bought a case for my Generation 1 iPhone so that my daughter
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.120]   could use it.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.680]   And she put stickers all over the back.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   Seven-year-old?
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   Yeah, the five-year-old.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:10.040]   She could listen to her Story Nori podcast on there, which is like two years ago, it's
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   like we're standing in lines, showing out $600.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   How amazing.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.000]   Then I was just like, nah, here you go, kid.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Go nuts.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.120]   Story Nori time.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.200]   I waited six hours, yeah, for my iPhone first gen.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.440]   So I think that's one thing you're going to see in the next generation iPhone, which
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.040]   is probably June right, is a much better screen you have.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.960]   For sure, it has to be.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   They have to go.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.080]   I've been benchmarking the Android versus my iPhone.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:40.440]   And I have to tell you, for the three or four things I do most, which are Gmail, Surf
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:46.240]   the Web, Twitter, and Forceware, I enjoy it more on my Android phone.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   And the Android--
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.720]   Fast-use, seismic, or a twidroid on your Android?
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.640]   I use twitroid.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.640]   Twitroid.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.640]   Yeah, twitroid.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.640]   Yeah, twitroid.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.320]   And although it doesn't have the applications available, the fact that I can load the application
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.720]   at any time is kind of cool.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.000]   Like I loaded some of those applications directly from the person who created its site, as opposed
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.120]   to the app store.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.800]   And it's faster, both on the network basis, obviously.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.160]   It also feels like it's a faster processor in memory.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.040]   Switching between applications on my iPhone feels like it takes about five seconds to
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.840]   get out of an application to get to the next one.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.000]   And it feels like it takes me half that amount of time on the Droid phone.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.720]   It just feels stable.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.360]   The Droid feels stable and fast, and the iPhone feels sluggish on two levels.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   Same process.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   And then now--
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.360]   I think it's the same process.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.080]   It's the Cortex-A in the G3GS.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.560]   I'm pretty sure that's what's in the Droid as well.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.560]   So it's the same process.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   It might be an operating system.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.040]   The operating system is more efficient, maybe.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   Memory usage at work.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.080]   It's not been my experience that the Droid is faster.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   It seems to me about the same.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.640]   And the N900 also uses the A8.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.840]   Here's a picture I took of John and-- was that Roger?
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840]   Yeah, Roger.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.440]   --at your party with the N900?
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.600]   I think that's with the Flash.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   It was dark in there.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.600]   I think that was--
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   I was not to say it looks like there's a Flash.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   I didn't believe you for a second.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   But that's pretty good.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.640]   It's got two LED Flash on it.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.640]   It's pretty good, yeah.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.400]   Yeah, the lens is some sort of weird--
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.400]   Not a great lens.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   No, it sucks.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.040]   I'll show you the picture that you just took of me.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.080]   That's a beauty right there.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.200]   For those of you not watching on video,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.400]   it looks like Leo's falling asleep.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.600]   Probably was at some point during this conversation.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.400]   Yeah, well, maybe we should move on to a new topic.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.520]   I could show you some video.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.520]   You want to see some video?
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.280]   This is video I shot with the phone.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.680]   Shoots M. This is the N900.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.040]   I'm actually really liking the N900 in terms of--
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.360]   so that's pretty high quality video.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.040]   That's in sunlight.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:42.880]   Kind of a Herky jerk.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.440]   No, that's unfortunately the way we're playing it off the Mac.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.080]   If you look at the Mac over here--
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   Well, these are a little--
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.880]   That's the video capture, I guess.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.000]   Yeah, it's the-- it's a little Herky jerk.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.600]   But the quality is stunning.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.040]   Well, considering it's kind of a weird--
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.520]   are you just shooting yourself or something?
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.800]   I'm holding it in a parking lot.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.960]   I was doing a little--
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.920]   a vlog, but I decided not to post it,
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.640]   because it was so namely self-referential and solipsistic
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.880]   that--
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.440]   In fact, I just--
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.680]   They felt like you needed to save it for this week in tech.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.280]   I thought I'd show it here.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.680]   No, I just-- well, wait a minute.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.920]   OK, hold on.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.480]   There's--
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.160]   Oh, there's the race.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.720]   Oh, yeah, there's my baby.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.480]   Oh, sweet bite.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.480]   It's no Tesla, Jason, but it does feature the Ford--
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.080]   Oh, I love a Ford Mustang.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:25.920]   It features the--
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.920]   It features the Ford Sync inside.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.120]   What are-- what tell us about the Ford Sync to Leo?
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.480]   No, well, I have to tell you something.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.320]   Hold on a second.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.200]   I went and test drove the Ford--
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   Tourist, the SHF.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:37.680]   Flex.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.960]   The Flex is great.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.520]   Isn't the Flex great?
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.320]   The van.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.680]   The sickest computer system in it.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.120]   That's the same--
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.200]   Is this the same computer system?
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:44.720]   Same thing.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.280]   What's it called?
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.120]   We want to buy a Flex for going down a CES,
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.000]   because that thing is huge.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.160]   It's like their version of the suburban-- look at the pony
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.000]   come up when you turn on the car.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:53.520]   Oh, Mustang.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.120]   You get a little pony on it.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.800]   This is a version of Sync that has the electronics package.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.160]   So it'll be a--
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   Tell us more, Leo.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.480]   The idea of Sync is that you don't take your eyes off the road.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.800]   You don't take your hands off the wheel.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.400]   It goes turn by turn.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.280]   Because you can say things like climate, temperature, 72
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.200]   degrees.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.600]   You can say destination.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.520]   You just press this button right there on the wheel.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.400]   That's the button you press.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.320]   It goes, don't.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.240]   And you can say things--
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   It's like a Michael Knight.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.080]   It is.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.480]   It's my Knight Rider car.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.320]   It's awesome.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.960]   You get on this little homemade video you did.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.840]   How did you get the-- oh, I see you're using the car
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.320]   run on top of the video for--
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:29.800]   Yes.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.880]   This is a commercial you're doing.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.400]   Thank you, John.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.280]   You noticed.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.720]   I slipped it in.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.880]   I slipped it right in there.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.880]   Holy mackerel.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.720]   Look at that.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.240]   Oh, man.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:38.920]   I am good.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.200]   I don't know how you managed it.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   You can get five-day forecasts using serious travel link.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.600]   Now, this one, I hadn't started the car,
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.560]   so it was acquiring it.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.680]   But by the time you've driven for a half a minute,
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.920]   it's acquired the latest movie listings,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.560]   the latest fuel prices.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.880]   It's ski information.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.480]   You can get sports scores.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.360]   This is all built in, and you talk to it.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.280]   Now, that's the amazing thing.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.840]   You press the button on your wheel.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.680]   You keep your eyes on the road, and you say,
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.880]   sports scores, NFL.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.440]   And it'll tell you the NFL scores.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.120]   It's the amazing Ford Sync, and I want you to take a look at it.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:12.000]   It's syncmyridepodcast.com.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.440]   We might bring a flex down.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.160]   We're going to take the Mustang down to CES.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.400]   It might bring the flex down and park it out front
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.600]   so people can take a look at it.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.320]   But if you're not going to CES,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.720]   you got to go down to your Ford Linkin or Mercury dealer
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.560]   and take a look.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.760]   Did you actually take a test drive and the flex?
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.600]   I took a test drive because I want to get a second car.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.280]   Now that we got the kid, I need a backup car.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   Like a third car.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:33.800]   It's cool.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.880]   The flex I drove had in the back, in the pedestal,
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.320]   for the people in the back, it had a little cooler, which could be--
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.040]   It's got the refrigerator.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.040]   It's awesome.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.640]   It's a 30 grand.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.720]   It's a great car.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.840]   Leather seats.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.080]   The sound system in that thing is amazing.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.720]   I think it's--
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.920]   So I'm thinking about getting it.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.720]   You should.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   Then you could do a Ford Sync ad in your--
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.560]   By the way, our web producer on NSFW
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.480]   is actually buying a Ford Sync vehicle.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.920]   He's going through all the motions
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.560]   to make sure he actually gets the Ford Sync.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.760]   So we'll actually have firsthand reports on our little show
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.240]   as well.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.760]   Oh, that's good.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.560]   Yeah, it's really--
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.440]   in all sincerity, the ad has ended now.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.080]   I am a fan.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.360]   It's a really nice system.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.120]   They're going to open it.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.480]   They're going to add apps.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.720]   You know, I saw an HP printer ad last week
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.800]   where there was an app--
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.280]   a fan day.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.600]   I think I mentioned this last week on Twitch.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.160]   There's a FanDango app.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.080]   We're going to--
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.280]   2010 is going to be the year of the app.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.000]   Everything, your refrigerator, your microwave, your car,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.960]   your printer, it's all going to have apps in it.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.000]   There's an app for it.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.120]   I had no idea about that.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.840]   You really-- you're going to be able to download apps
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.880]   for your Ford Sync vehicle.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   The reason is because that's just interest to me
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.040]   is because I'm convinced that's what was so great about the iPhone
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.760]   from the beginning is that every few weeks it would randomly
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.000]   get better on its own.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.600]   And the idea of being able to do that in a vehicle
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.200]   would be amazing.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.240]   I think everybody's kind of cognizant of that.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.960]   That's why the Android marketplace is so important.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.120]   By the way, new app in the Android marketplace this week.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.880]   Who's played with Google Boggles?
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.800]   What do you think, Jason?
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.520]   I'll play it a little bit with it.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   I've played with it with mixed results.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.200]   Very obvious things like assign that Walgreens or whatever.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.560]   It's going to--
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.520]   It seems to have text recognition built into it.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.840]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.480]   At least in my experience with it,
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.840]   it's not nearly as strong with things like objects.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.240]   But it's almost-- if you're pointing it at a label
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.040]   and you scan the label like a wine bottle or something,
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.840]   it does a pretty good job with it.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.200]   Pretty cool.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.120]   This is something Google has announced
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.040]   that I think could be a huge breakthrough.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.000]   The idea is you have in your camera phone an application
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.040]   called goggles.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.520]   You point it at something.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.800]   They in their video use as an example, Big Ben or the London
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.680]   Eye.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.000]   The picture is sent to Google which interprets it
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.880]   and then gives you search results based on the picture
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.200]   you took.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.840]   They say we could do this with faces,
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.440]   but we've turned that off because of privacy issues.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.920]   They're blurring faces.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.760]   I think this is really intriguing.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.880]   What if I think they should leave it on?
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.880]   I don't think-- I think government already
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.360]   knows how to do this, so why should we not be able to do it?
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.640]   Right.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.200]   Am I right?
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.320]   Yeah, you're definitely using location based information
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:14.680]   as well.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.200]   Crazy.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.760]   That's what it sees.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.400]   Ah, that's a good question.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.720]   That's a very interesting question.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.600]   I don't know.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.200]   I presume that it could.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.560]   Good.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.960]   You know what would be great is if it did and it knew
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.440]   if you're in Texas and it'd take a picture of Big Ben,
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.040]   it'd be like this is a photograph of Big Ben.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:31.720]   Like it does.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.000]   Those are a liar.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.520]   Well, it does.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.200]   You can take pictures of logos, text,
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.440]   and it will then interpret that.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.440]   I think this is the beginning of--
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.200]   Skyna.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.440]   To be honest, I think it's the--
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.640]   Well, everything--
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.120]   Total information awareness.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.520]   Total TIA.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.080]   Total information awareness.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.840]   That's the idea.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.920]   So how long before you're wearing a camera all the time
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.440]   that's on all the time and just knows where you are,
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.200]   what's going on?
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.480]   I walk up to John and says, John has four children.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.440]   JC has just been released from prison or whatever.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.040]   And I say, John, how's the kids?
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.520]   Oh, I mean, you're scared.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.320]   Prison actually, but you have a green college.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:15.640]   Same thing.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.140]   Close.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.640]   Hey, just graduated.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.880]   That's what I graduated this.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   I tell you what, man, I would sign up for that in a heartbeat.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.240]   Where are some glasses that identify all the faces
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.520]   and remind you of what everyone's name is?
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.320]   Oh, yeah, when you do it the way Leo and I do it is, hey,
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.280]   how you doing?
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.280]   By the way, the trick for people who have trouble
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.360]   remembering people because you meet too many, you know,
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.200]   I'd be like, what are you doing?
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.240]   No, John, it's not because we meet too many.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.280]   No, that's the reason, Leo.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.320]   It's because we're old, John.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.440]   It's because we're old.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.040]   Anyway, the trick for everybody out there is like,
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.000]   so what are you doing?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.120]   Hey, give me your new card.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.880]   Because everyone always changes jobs around the high ticket.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.680]   So you get their new card and then your cop will look at it.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.120]   Oh, geez.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   First thing first.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.240]   My brother.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.280]   You know what I hate is when you're you're there with your wife
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.400]   and the person fully expects reasonably so that you will
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.360]   introduce them to your wife.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.200]   I hate to introduce yourself.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.160]   I have a system.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.040]   That's the trick.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.280]   All right.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.040]   What's your system?
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.560]   What's your system?
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.480]   I've got a great system.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:11.920]   OK.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.160]   My wife and I have had this discussion many times.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.680]   And what I say to her is if I do not immediately introduce
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.200]   you to the person, you are to stick your hand out and say,
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.400]   hi, I'm Jason's wife, Jane.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:21.840]   Nice to meet you.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.600]   What's your name?
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.880]   That's exactly it.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.360]   It works like a charm.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.760]   Yeah, it would work with your wife.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.720]   But it's like with your casual, you know, you're walking
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.440]   around somebody else and you have to do this introduction.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.320]   It's kind of embarrassing.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.600]   No, you don't have to have my business like Tyler.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.520]   It's my strategy guy.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.360]   Tyler.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   We only have Tyler.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.880]   We only need a Tyler.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   I have a I have a Dane.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.840]   And he works very well for that.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.520]   But we all need we all need somebody like that.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.400]   But I wouldn't be nice to him.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.320]   A wing woman is good.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.520]   A wing woman.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.240]   Wouldn't it be nice to him?
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:50.560]   He's my wing guy.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:50.920]   But yeah.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.760]   And he also prepares dossies for me.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.360]   When I go to a conference or something like that or a dinner,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.640]   he'll research everybody in advance and give me a minnow
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.000]   of folder and we're on the flight or whatever on the way there.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.280]   We'll go through who's going to be there.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.400]   And I'll know their LinkedIn page, where they went to school,
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.320]   where they worked before that.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.160]   So I can say, oh, yeah, you worked at Yahoo before this.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:13.280]   So for people who can't afford this, the computer should be perfect at this.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.880]   Now, Jason, how you're right, it's not--
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.480]   I mean, I played with it as you have on our droids.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.040]   And it's not-- it's far for perfect.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.120]   But it recognizes some tech, some logos.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.880]   And I think it's probably the type of thing
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.400]   that the more you use it, the more people collectively use it.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.760]   You know, they'll enhance it and make it smarter.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.000]   And yeah, I think it's a good sign of things to come.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.400]   I think it's a pretty awesome technology for that reason.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.280]   It's a case where they have a technological grammar, but no vocabulary yet.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.560]   And the more it gets used, the more it
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.680]   one logs in all the words, it'll eventually start to work perfectly.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.160]   OK.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.200]   Next topic.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.600]   I thought that was a very kind of neat analogy.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.880]   I want to talk about this thing.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.920]   A technological grammar.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.440]   I thought that was what?
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   I stole that from a Star Trek episode.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.440]   It all comes back to Gene Rod and Barry Hill.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.640]   And Barry Hill, the Star Trek movie.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.400]   Pretty good, huh?
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.120]   Yeah, I enjoyed it.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.200]   I was skeptical, but I--
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.440]   Oh, no, it was great.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.040]   Everybody seems to have liked it.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.760]   And they reset the whole series, so now they can go off in their merry way
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   and do it over and over.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.600]   Well, I'd like to refer you back to "Twit" episode 217,
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.520]   in which we discussed this in great length.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.640]   Yeah, we're not going to talk about that.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.920]   But I want to talk about Callie Canis' Facebook grudge.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.800]   That is an interesting post.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.480]   Now, Jason, I know that you ask that people do not post your email
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.000]   to websites.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.920]   I posted it on my blog, it's at CallieCanis.com.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.880]   It's just, you know what the problem is?
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.640]   Now my phone is ringing in all these journals.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.840]   Like, I'm trying to quote you.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.440]   Where can I find this thing?
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   So I put it on Callie Canis.com.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.160]   He's of a background.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:33.920]   We need a background.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.200]   What I did is I sent it out just to the participants here.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.600]   But now that it's on CallieCanis.com, you could read it yourself.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.680]   By the way, we have a Facebook employee in studio
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.720]   who shall remain nameless.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.560]   Mr. Zuckerberg, you don't have to say anything.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:44.960]   It's really.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.840]   It's OK.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.880]   But I told him the name of the--
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.360]   He's in charge of--
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.920]   I won't even say that because that would give away
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.920]   your personality.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.920]   But he works at Facebook.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.480]   And I read him your title, Jason.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.600]   Is Facebook unethical, clueless, or unlucky?
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.720]   Pick one.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.200]   What is--
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.440]   You should be your wife.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.800]   What exactly-- is this about the new privacy stuff?
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.560]   This is about the new privacy stuff.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.440]   For those of you who don't know or who don't use Facebook,
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.680]   which is nobody, when you logged in this week,
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.880]   you saw a terms of service pop up.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.000]   Like, hey, we've changed things in your privacy settings.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.920]   And then click here to go to the next screen.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.000]   And then there's another screen that says, OK,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.160]   click here to set your settings.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.280]   And like most people, you click through those terms
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.520]   of service agreements.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.640]   And if you do, which I did, and a lot of other people do--
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.440]   because you're like, I'll deal with this later, whatever it is--
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.560]   you just turned all of your private information on.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.280]   The default sort of set.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.280]   You're kidding.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.520]   Public to charity with everybody.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.520]   And it's extraordinary and so underhanded.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.040]   Because we all know in the industry
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.440]   that the terms of service and agreeing to a terms of service
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.520]   is a formality.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.440]   Nobody reads them.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.640]   And the expectation is there'll be nothing unreasonable in them
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.880]   if there is the EFF or some pundit
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.680]   is going to go crazy when people do something underhanded.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.440]   Well, guess what?
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.840]   Facebook did something wildly underhanded a week
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   after settling their beacon lawsuit.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.520]   And I'm the last person to this party.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.840]   I may have wrote it in the strongest way.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.920]   But Dan Gilmour is mentioning this earlier in the week,
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.760]   as were many other people who are much more qualified
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.040]   to talk about it than I am.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.200]   But it is unconscionable for a company
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.240]   that has a sophisticated Facebook to make privacy wonders
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.760]   like this over and over and over again.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.600]   We are making privacy announcement.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.000]   Thank you for showing this, Brian.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.680]   We're making some changes to give you
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.640]   more control of your information
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.800]   and to help you stay connected.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.200]   Now, this is what you get on the front page when you--
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.400]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.560]   We've simplified the privacy page
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.640]   and added the ability to set privacy and everything
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.760]   you share from status updates to photos.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.920]   At the same time, we are helping everyone find
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.520]   and connect with each other by keeping some information,
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.160]   like your name and profile picture, publicly available.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.520]   The next step will guide you through choosing your privacy
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:05.960]   settings.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.760]   You can learn more about privacy works here.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.800]   So if you click that, Brian, does it then--
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   has it checked-- see, my settings were set to everyone,
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   anyway, so I don't know--
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.760]   If you previously--
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.560]   I'll talk quickly on this as continue to next step now,
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.600]   and it does give you a bunch of radio buttons that--
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.840]   So but if I ignored that, would I--
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.800]   It's defaulted normally to everybody, to everyone.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.480]   For some reason, this one is defaulted to old settings.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.080]   So when some reason it's your post, dude, words are already out.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.280]   Oh, really, did they switch it today?
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:34.640]   Oh, I'm under.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.280]   I'm assuming.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:35.720]   I don't know.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.960]   If it just automatically headed over to everyone,
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.760]   because it's most of your day.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.280]   On my--
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.360]   On my glitch.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:41.840]   I don't know.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.680]   I'm not as--
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.960]   No, everybody's talking about this.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.720]   I'm not the only one.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.240]   OK.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.640]   Mine kept old settings when I set that up.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.560]   If you've previously changed your settings,
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.240]   it will keep your old settings.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.640]   Only 0.01% of you are already changed your privacy settings.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.480]   If you never set your settings, it now would be everyone.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.200]   Exactly.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.680]   And so what that means is the people who are the most
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.920]   clueless and who have never touched the privacy settings
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.440]   are the ones who are going to get--
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.320]   Exactly.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:05.800]   The quickest.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.480]   I'm under-fighting a comment.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.760]   So basically what Facebook has done is they've basically said,
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.920]   we understand user behavior in this case
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.720]   is to click straight through.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.560]   Therefore, we're going to take advantage of that.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:22.760]   And this is Facebook's entire ethical compass, which is,
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.880]   if we can get away with it and nobody catches us,
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.120]   then it's OK.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.520]   And they're really screwing it up for the entire industry,
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.600]   because they are going to bring the heat down on everybody
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.440]   from the government.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.000]   And there will be lawsuits on this one
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.600]   that will be bigger than Beacon.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.960]   There's going to be federal intervention.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.840]   And they're screwing it up for the entire industry.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.600]   And people wondered when we would get another Microsoft-type
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.160]   company, Fjordka, JZ.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.000]   And this is it.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Jason?
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.880]   Why are they doing this?
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.240]   What benefit do they gain from it?
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.000]   Great question.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.760]   And I addressed it in my email, which is,
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.920]   they want to take every single piece of information
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.000]   in Facebook that they collected under the auspices
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.800]   of it being private to your network and monetize it.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.400]   How will they monetize it by putting it in search engines?
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.400]   All this information will be indexed in Google.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.400]   So when somebody takes it--
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   I'm on the John DeVore--
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.400]   Hold on just a second.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.040]   Hold on just a second.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.200]   I've got my mom on the line.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   Hold on a second.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.600]   Mom, you're on Twitter right now.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.760]   I just wanted--
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.280]   Can you go to your computer?
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.680]   Can you go to your computer?
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.000]   It takes me a minute.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.040]   I'm in another room.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.040]   Yeah, just go over your laptop.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.200]   You haven't logged on to Facebook this week, have you?
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.080]   No, I'm just not doing it.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.600]   I don't understand any of it.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   There you go.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   Just a question.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   Yes.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   Just a question.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.080]   Did you ever-- go over to your laptop and open up.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.960]   I just want-- we were trying to verify if something has
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.280]   changed on Facebook.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.400]   When you set up Facebook, did you ever go into your privacy
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.800]   settings at all?
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   No.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   No.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   OK, that's good.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   That's what we want.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.480]   And I keep having a lot of people that seem to want me to
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.000]   recognize them as a friend.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.080]   I don't understand at all because I don't know anyone is
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.080]   doing it.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   How's your farm bill doing?
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   Are you still doing that?
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   My what?
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.520]   Farm bill.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.840]   Your farm.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.480]   Your Facebook farm.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.520]   I can't hear what you're saying, honey.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   That's OK.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.520]   You don't have to pretend.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.520]   We understand.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.520]   Just--
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.760]   Do you open your-- no, don't go to Twit Live.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760]   I want you to go to Facebook.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.240]   Just tell me something when you open your Facebook.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.040]   OK, one more second.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.200]   By the way, Farmtown, much more fun than Farmville.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.520]   Don't tell me what you were just saying because I'm just
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   in my--
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   No, no, that's OK.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.520]   Honey.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.520]   I was making a joke.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.520]   It's no big deal.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.520]   Are you--
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.520]   Talk about that.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.960]   We're on the air right now.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.600]   I'm trying to figure out if Facebook has done something to
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.360]   you without your knowledge.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360]   Oh, geez.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   It's not that cool.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   But you were sleeping, baby.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.800]   No, no, I know about Facebook is I'm signed up for it.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.120]   Yeah, well, can you go to your computer?
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.120]   Are you at your computer?
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   Yeah, I'm coming back here now.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.120]   OK.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.320]   And I'm going to the computer now.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.320]   And where do I go?
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.640]   Just to open your browser and go to Facebook.com.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   OK.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   OK.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.800]   I just want to see what your settings--
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   Your settings.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Do you remember how to log in and all that?
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   You've logged in.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   You've got Facebook ads.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   I'm going to go to Safari and then--
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   Just go to Facebook.com.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   Right?
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   OK.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   Just--
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   No.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   Oh my gosh.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   Oh, shit.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   Sorry.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   Close.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   You don't-- never mind.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   Go, go, go, go.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   I love him.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   You love his hands?
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   Hey, God.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.800]   Hey.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.800]   All right.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   Mom, you got to mute the audio because it's coming--
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   Call her.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   Call her.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   Turn down your radio.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   Now we're in an endless loop of shit.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   You got to mute the audio on that because, yeah, it's--
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.800]   No, not you.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   The audio on your computer.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   No, it's not you.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   The audio on it.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   It's coming back through.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   OK.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   Come here.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   Come here.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   I'm so sorry I started this.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   This is the endlessly recursive episode of This Week.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   The question is, can I stop it or is this going to go on forever?
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   That's the real question at this point.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.800]   We just pointed the video camera right at the screen.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   We're looking at the infinite hall of mirrors there.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   Exactly.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   OK.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   No, you got to-- no.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   Just mute the ever mind.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   I'll talk to you later, mama.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   I love you.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   I'll call you after the show and we'll get so long.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   Bye, bye, mom.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   Bye, mom.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   Bye, mom.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   That was genius.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   Well, I thought maybe I could--
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   That's show business.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   Show business, baby.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800]   She loves you, apparently, though, Josh.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.800]   She's a wise woman.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   She loves you.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.800]   She loves you.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   The John Tivorak is wonderful.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   I love him and the hair.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   And he's a good looking man.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   I love the thought, but he's a good looking man.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   Good looking man.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.800]   He's a--
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   He's handsome.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   He's a lovely, lovely human being.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   He's a kind of guy.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   He's very funny.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   Yeah, very.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   Which is, by the way, Leo, the chat room would like to point out that if you're using go
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   to assist, you wouldn't have this problem right now.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   There you have it.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   I think this should be discussed.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   Yeah, well, you know, you could also use go to my PC for this.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   I would be able to go just log right into her system.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   That's right.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   It's all from-- it's all--
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   It's all--
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   You haven't-- you're on an account, I'm sure.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   Oh, should I actually ever go to assist?
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   Absolutely.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   I'm just going to say, I'm going to go to the next one.

[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:10.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   I have some quarters.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   I'm trying to put them into the laptop.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   Where do I put them in the USB?
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   Is where the coins go for the farmville?
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   Mom, I love you.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   It's nothing against you, Mom.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   It really is.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   I love you too.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   We all love you.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.800]   The Ford Mustang, you got me.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   You are the greatest son.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.800]   Do you ever buy his mother a pink Cadillac?
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   I love the Mustang you got me in red.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.800]   I am telling you, the recipes that it comes up
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   when you order a recipe on the Flex system.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   I made your father rice pudding.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   He loved it with the raisins.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   Sometimes it comes up a little bit.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   It repeats, but that's okay.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   He loves the raisins.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   It's wonderful.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   Make sure you tell the John Devorak I've made
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   rice pudding for him too.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   She probably has.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   Actually, Mom's a very good cook and she cooks Italian.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.800]   Very good Italian.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.800]   She makes a homemade ravioli.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   Oh, she does.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   She makes the right dough.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   Oh, she makes the dough herself.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   It's kind of real with a pasta machine.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   Yeah, that's very good.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.800]   Not that harsh.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   When we were when I was a kid, we were in Genoa.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   And nobody in the United States had ever had pesto before
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   and we had this green stuff.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   She said, "What is this?"
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   And said, "Pesto, she brought it."
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.800]   She is the person who brought it to the United States.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   She introduced pesto to the United States.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   Wow.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   Just want to tell you that.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.800]   That was back in 1967.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   So, you could thank Mom.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   Oh, well, I like pesto.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   Oh, two dozen.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   Who does it?
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   Leo, I'm letting you the ravioli with the pesto.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   All right, stop it.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   Don't talk on the public.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.360]   Now, tell me.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.680]   So what are...
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.680]   Was Facebook intentionally...
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.800]   We didn't really get to the bottom line, which is why Jason does Facebook.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.560]   Why is there a benefit to them?
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.560]   What is it?
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   What do they get out of it?
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   Yes.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.200]   The benefit is they're watching Twitter take over Google search results and having all
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.720]   this content publicly facing means they get not only all the social traffic, people going
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.480]   there to check their email and their friends in Play Farmville, they're going to get SEO
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   traffic.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.960]   So they're going to have their IPO next year.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.600]   They want to maximize traffic and they want to monetize all their assets.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.480]   The only way to monetize those assets is if they're indexed in Google, Yahoo and Bing,
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.320]   they want to take everything you've put in there under the trust that they've built with
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.680]   you and expose it to the world to make a quick buck on the ads around your photos.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.760]   So when somebody types in John Devorak, Man Keni, they can put ads around it now.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.120]   The Keni pictures John are no longer going to be private.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.800]   So really what you're saying is it's Twitter envy.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   Mooney Mooney Mooney.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.480]   This is the thing with Facebook.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.680]   Facebook's like the E.K.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:33.200]   It's like, first is trying to be my space and then it's trying to be Twitter.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.200]   Come on Facebook.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.000]   Don't you realize that you're beautiful on the inside?
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.760]   We love you for who you are.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   Come on.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   I don't know.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   I'm not buying.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   I'm not completely buying this theory.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.080]   I think it's I'll be honest.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:50.440]   I know that Facebook wants to have a public face that they, it's very clear when they
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:57.000]   did the OAuth stuff, when they did the widget stuff, that they felt like there's an opportunity
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.160]   that we're missing because from day one we were very privacy focused.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:06.600]   It's a very difficult thing for them because they know that their users are extraordinarily
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.040]   privacy focused.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.280]   That's why they went to Facebook.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   That's why they didn't go to MySpace.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.800]   Privacy is very important to them.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:17.880]   It's a very difficult thing for Facebook because while they'd like to be open, they'd like
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.560]   to be publicly facing.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.560]   It's not in their DNA.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.760]   It's not what they do.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.000]   It's not their brand value.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   It's not their value proposition.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.200]   It's not what they sold America on.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.200]   It's not exactly the world.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:34.520]   When I think they're coming, I think they're cognizant of that and that's why I agree with
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.520]   you, John.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.840]   I don't think they would surreptitiously do something like this because there's too much
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.040]   at risk.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.240]   You think that a company that has built the largest social network in history has no idea
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.840]   how to put people through a process to set their privacy settings?
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   I think they're just idiots.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.840]   It's screwed up.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.840]   I think it's a flub.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.840]   Okay.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.960]   I think that you're giving them a lot of credit.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:59.360]   If they are that incompetent, I'm wondering how that was one of the options you gave.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.360]   They could be clueless.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.160]   They're just picking the clueless.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.000]   You gave us the option, Jason.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   All right.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   But I put it there as a joke.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Screw you, Jason.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Screw you.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.080]   He's been waiting to say that.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   I could tell.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.400]   Well, here's what Kevin Rose says on Twitter a moment ago.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.000]   He says, "I see their actions as purely defensive against Twitter.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.600]   They need public data to build social search trends, etc.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.040]   And Kevin Rose is exactly right."
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.040]   So you...
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   Well...
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.040]   No, no, you are.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.040]   I wonder if Kevin's listening.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.200]   Kevin, if you're listening, would love to have you on.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   Yeah, Kevin's not listening.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.200]   Sure he is.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   That's why he...
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.000]   Kevin's on number 17 mistress.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   No, that's tiger.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   Oh, tiger.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.400]   Actually, according to Boa Wahlah, Kevin Rose has a serious tea problem.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.400]   He definitely.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.880]   He's checking in like three or four times a day for tea.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.880]   Kids got a problem.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.120]   It's time for a Twit intervention.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   We should have a tea intervention.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.120]   A total tea intervention.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.120]   You can't have a tea.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.960]   Put down the jasmine.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.120]   You know, and I've been...
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.920]   Because of him, we got in connection with this...
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.160]   Oh, my mom's calling.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.160]   Uh-oh.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.160]   Okay.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.160]   Okay.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.160]   Hold this.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.160]   Here we go again.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.160]   Round two.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.160]   Hi, mom.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   Hey.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.160]   Try to see me.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.520]   Well, we can't see you till you turn on the video.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.520]   But...
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.520]   She wants to be on the show.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.520]   Hey, hey.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.520]   Hey, hey.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.520]   Hold on a second.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   Hold on.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.520]   Hold on, mom.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.520]   Okay.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.520]   You got it.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.520]   That's episode ever.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.840]   You got to turn off the Twit Live because it's coming back to me.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.840]   It's coming back to me.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   You got to turn off the Twit Live.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   There's mom.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.840]   That's Twit Live.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.840]   It's coming back to me.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.840]   Just a minute.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.840]   Okay.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   Okay.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.840]   Just a minute.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.840]   Oh, you see it's going and going and going.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:37.840]   I told you.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.840]   Impedantly recursive.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.840]   There's a silence button.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.840]   Oh, my God.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.840]   There's a silence button.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.840]   Oh, my God.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.840]   There's a silence button.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.840]   Oh, my God.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   There's a silence button.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.840]   She can just close the window.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   Just close that browser window.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.840]   I think I broke the internet.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   Well, let's see if that's a window, mom.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:57.840]   Okay.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:05.040]   We'll check back with mom a little later on and see if she's got it fixed there.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.040]   Open your Facebook, mom.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.040]   And we'll talk.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.920]   Don't do not the Twit Live.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.080]   I think we got a name for the show, Mom Book.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.080]   Mom.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.080]   It is.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:18.680]   But you made a good point that this particularly strikes people who have just assumed that
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.160]   their Facebook is protecting their privacy.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.520]   I think a lot of people don't care.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   Their whole brand.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.160]   I think a lot of people don't realize that they have to people out there who don't care
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.640]   about privacy at all.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:29.640]   They've given up on it.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.640]   I think it's a huge one.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.640]   That's a huge one.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.640]   That's a huge one.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.640]   That's a huge one.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.640]   That's a huge one.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.640]   That's a huge one.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.880]   I don't think that's the right age break.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.880]   Did you see what Schmidt said?
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.880]   Schmidt.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.880]   How's Schmidt?
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.880]   Schmidt.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:44.880]   Ah, yes.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.120]   This is the most glib and obnoxious comment.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.560]   He's a really smart guy.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.960]   I agree with you a thousand percent on that one.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.960]   It's glib.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.960]   It was arrogant.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.440]   It was patronizing and it was wrong-headed because I like I wrote a column in Market Watch
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.200]   that ran on Friday to discuss this in detail.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:05.000]   And the thing that people don't realize about privacy is it's not about you.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.320]   It's not about, oh, my privacy, my privacy.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:11.960]   The idea is that if you don't have privacy that people who are public servants that may
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:17.120]   have to vote on something can be blackmailed and other things, bad things can happen.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:21.240]   If privacy standards are lax, it's not about you.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:27.440]   It's about the whole system, the structure of society, the opportunity for corruption.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.200]   We have to protect privacy for that reason alone.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.560]   It's ridiculous that someone would glibbly say what Schmidt said.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.560]   He should apologize.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.560]   Let me just say what he said.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:41.560]   Before you say the quote, I just want to let people imagine this quote and think to yourself,
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:50.120]   Stalin, Hitler, George Bush the second, and then pick any other, or Kim Jong-ee or Aaron
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.120]   Darth Vader.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   Darth Vader.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   Darth Vader.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:57.360]   I, for one, welcome our new Google Orbele Awards.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:03.200]   This was during a CNBC, Maria Bartiromo show called Inside the Mind of Google.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.680]   They sat down with Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, and asked him whether users should
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:13.120]   be sharing information with Google as if it were a trusted friend Schmidt responded.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:19.680]   If you have something you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.160]   the first place.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.720]   If you're selling your Google shares, maybe you need to consider this.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.120]   No, I love EFS.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.200]   EFS response to this is fantastic.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.760]   They quote a Bruce Schnire article that really is right down your alley.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:40.880]   Schnire wrote in 2006 that privacy is an inherent human right and a requirement for maintaining
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.520]   the human condition with dignity and respect.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:49.800]   He said, "For if we are observed in all matters, we are constantly under threat of correction,
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.600]   judgment, criticism, even plagiarism of our own uniqueness.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:52:00.120]   We become, and I love this, we become children, fet- mom, fettered under what- he didn't
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.120]   say, "Mom, I did."
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:06.160]   "Fettered under watchful eyes, constantly fearful that either now or in the uncertain
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:11.640]   future patterns we leave behind will be brought back to implicate us by whatever authority
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:15.000]   has now become focused on our once private and innocent acts.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.760]   We lose our individuality because everything we do is observable and recordable."
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.800]   You know, there's another aspect to this which I mentioned to keep the market watch
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.960]   angle correct, since it's a stock tip sheet.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:33.320]   If you, like I just suggested, give me the Google Mail database and let me have at it
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.320]   for about a week.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.560]   I'll be able to determine every merger and acquisition.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.360]   The system would be corrupted overnight with this-
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.080]   The insider information that they have.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.480]   Insider information is corrupting.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:50.760]   People appreciate the services for giving up that, like forgiving up privacy.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:56.400]   They appreciate having that free email service, the social networking status, and if you don't
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.400]   pay attention to it all.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.600]   Like, I've wanted to encrypt my Gmail account for a long time and then I realized they were
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.240]   never going to make that easy to do.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.880]   Unless you set up your own email server and take care of that yourself.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.880]   That's a good point.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.200]   You can't encrypt Gmail easily.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   That's not easy.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:13.120]   Jason, how long does it take to monetize it if it's all encrypted?
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.280]   Let's put this in perspective.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.920]   Didn't Eric Schmidt get all pissed off at CNET?
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   There you go.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.920]   There you go.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:25.440]   When CNET had the temerity to publish information about him that was publicly available on Google
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.200]   and he cut him off for a year.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.200]   Am I right?
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.480]   That happened not too long ago, like a year and a half ago.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.280]   But it's okay for him to be on the other side of this argument.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   Right.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.280]   The tables have turned, haven't they?
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.600]   He should come out and say something.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   This is a...
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.760]   He's getting lambasted for it and rightly so.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760]   And I'll tell you what.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.840]   While I might give Facebook a free pass here, I'm certainly not going to give Eric Schmidt
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.840]   a free pass.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.840]   This is too much in his face all the time.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.840]   No way.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:54.240]   I took his statement though and I thought more of along the lines that, look, if you use
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:59.080]   Gmail, you're susceptible to being having everything looked at and you should be aware
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.080]   of that.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   I mean, that isn't that.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.840]   He said basically what police have said, police states have said always, which is if
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.800]   you're not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to hear from us.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   Exactly.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:13.920]   And by the way, this all stems from Scott McNeely who years earlier when Schmidt was
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.440]   actually the science officer at CTO.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.400]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.440]   There's a little connection.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.960]   McNeely says privacy is dead, get over it.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.960]   Just very famously.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.240]   Yeah, and just again a patronizing comment.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.160]   And Schmidt, I guess there was this that they all feel that way over there.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.360]   I think it's disgusting to be honest about it.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.120]   They don't think about the implications.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:43.520]   It's clear there's a financial incentive for either Facebook or the Google to know more
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.960]   about you because the more they know about it.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.560]   In fact, I'll be honest with you.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.720]   I've thought about it too.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:55.520]   I look at, and you're an investor in this Jason Calicanis, I look at GDGT and I say inspired
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:02.640]   because obviously Peter, and I don't blame them for this, but Peter and Ryan said what,
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:05.920]   you know, what's the single most important thing that Facebook does?
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.960]   They've created a compelling environment that gets people to volunteer personal information
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.440]   which they can then use to target ads.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.200]   GDGT same idea.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.640]   Tell us what gadgets you have and advertisers will very gladly buy that information.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:24.800]   Maybe an aggregate, maybe not individuals, but buy that information and use it to target
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.800]   ads at you.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.800]   Isn't that Jason?
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   Why you invested?
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:28.800]   Isn't that what it's a brilliant idea?
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:34.080]   Yeah, I listen, there's opting into something and it being very clearly stated that that's
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.080]   why you're doing it.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:39.800]   So if you choose to not care, you know, what phone you use, that's fine.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:45.160]   If you choose to care what your sexual preferences are or who you vote for, you know, that's
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.200]   a whole another story.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.120]   If there was a site like GDGT, I mean, there's also Goodreads, which is like what books
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.120]   have you read?
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.440]   So you give something, here are the books I've read or in GDGT, here's the phones I've
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.040]   owned and computers I've owned to get something in return.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.920]   You get to meet other people who have the same interest as you and the advertising is just
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.920]   a bonus.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.400]   They're not giving your names to people, they're just putting up an ad for an iPhone case
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   if you have an iPhone.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.800]   Well, isn't that just exactly what Google's doing?
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:16.520]   If Google is saving your searches, which you would rather not have them save and most people
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.240]   think are not saved for 18 months, it's wildly different.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:24.480]   When you put in a search, you don't assume that you're sharing that with anybody.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:29.240]   When you go to GDGT, you say, I would like to put this picture of an iPhone on my profile.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.200]   That's very explicit.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:35.560]   So I think there's a difference between explicit and implicit data and how you use it.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:40.680]   I guess the question though there is why do, and I'm not saying I'm for this, but why do
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:45.880]   we expect different out of a company that offers a search engine versus a company that
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:49.480]   offers you the ability to compare your tech gadgets?
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.480]   Or Facebook.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   Or Facebook.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   Or Facebook.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:56.920]   I'll tell you why, because in no case have your search results ever been shared with anybody.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   And in the case of putting on your profile, whether it's MySpace, GDGT or whatever, what
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.480]   city you were born in or what your favorite movie is, you do expect people to see it.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   Right.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.960]   And people have learned in a social network, your friends see it, other people don't,
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.760]   in the Facebook case.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:17.560]   And so there are some big differences, but the overarching thing when we had Leo's mom
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.880]   call in is she doesn't know.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:20.880]   She doesn't know.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.880]   She doesn't know.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:22.880]   She doesn't know about it.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.120]   Therefore, it's incumbent upon us, the technology industry, to behave ourselves.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:32.360]   And what's happened right now between Eric's comment and Facebook's, you know, insanely
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:37.440]   unethical behavior in my mind, you put these things together and then you start having
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   regulation.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.080]   Then you start having regulators, the EU and other people start saying, you know what,
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.160]   this industry can't police itself.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.560]   They're taking advantage of people.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.560]   We need to step in.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:48.560]   And that's the worst thing.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:52.120]   That was the best part of your letter, I thought, was the fact that if we don't do it,
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   somebody else is going to do it for us.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.480]   It's going to be government, it's going to be clunky and ham-handed and you're not going
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.480]   to like it.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.480]   So be good now before you get the alternative.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.480]   Absolutely.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:04.520]   And somebody who is sitting next to Zuckerberg, I know he's the golden child and, you know,
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.600]   he can't do anything wrong.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.520]   And I see him at the TED conference with 50 sycophants around him, you know, like treating
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.520]   him like is Jesus Christ or something.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:15.760]   But somebody, the adults who are around him need to sit him down and say, by the way,
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.400]   you know, technical might is not equal right.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   You need to have some ethics.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.440]   You need to start thinking about the users and loving them for what they've done for
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:26.000]   you because you know what, Facebook's not public yet and he hasn't cashed out yet.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.840]   That spot on the Forbes billionaire list is not locked.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.120]   That whole system could come apart if it loses people's trust.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.320]   And if he doesn't think so, he could look at what's happening to my space right now or
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.680]   what happened to friends for three years ago.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.800]   The mighty can fall and Facebook might have just tripped and they may be falling flat
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:44.200]   on their face if they do this, you know, another one, two, three times.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:48.440]   And you nailed it with all the other things that came before it.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.880]   This is a very fickle market, the social networking site.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.440]   I mean, how quickly did everybody jump from my space to Facebook?
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.760]   And if something else comes along, that's a little more fair, it could be all over.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:01.240]   If you ask people in our industry what they think of Facebook, if they think they're ethical
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:05.640]   and whatnot, they will say, hands down, no, people do not trust them with their data.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   Really?
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.680]   That is, that is what I have 150 responses right now.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:13.120]   Every single one of them is I don't trust and I'm going to print them without people's
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.240]   names on them and with permission.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:19.240]   You know, and there's under underlying this, there's an even deeper release of information
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.920]   that I think is actually more significant.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:27.880]   If you take a Facebook quiz, for instance, and information about you is released to the
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:32.680]   quiz master and also to other parties to the quiz.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.400]   Holy cow, Leo, that is dark.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.200]   I had never even considered that.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.160]   I thought that the great crime of those is that there are a waste of time.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.960]   No, it's all that.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.960]   And it really ends.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:42.960]   Oh, no, no.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:43.960]   In fact, who was it?
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.000]   Was it EFF somebody or was Epic somebody put out?
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:55.360]   Was the ACLU put out a Facebook quiz, you know, kind of using their platform and then said,
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.320]   here's what we know about you and worse.
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:03.680]   Here's what we know about your friends because you're also by taking the quiz, releasing
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.880]   information about your friends to the quiz master.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:12.760]   And I'm sure Zinga and Farmville and other applications running on Facebook have a similar
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.760]   issue.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.560]   The quiz, if you want to take it on Facebook is called, what do quizzes really know about
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   you?
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.840]   It's from the ACLU.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:27.600]   I recommend you take the quiz, if only if you trust the ACLU because they're going to
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.560]   learn a lot about you.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.160]   And you will then see exactly what happens behind the scenes.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:40.920]   And it was kind of an eye opener to me because it's not only that the quiz master learns
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.840]   about you, but they learn about your friends.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:48.000]   You're giving them information about third parties that the third party didn't agree
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.840]   to and didn't even take the quiz.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.040]   That is in the fine print of every one of the applications you install in Facebook.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.720]   And that's one reason I say far away from those things.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.720]   I just don't.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:05.120]   And I've gotten in the habit now of hiding every friend of mine who installs a new application.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.440]   And here's the trend.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   Where are all the mischievous, you know, marketers going and operating inside of Facebook and
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.520]   how is Facebook making their money through this mischievous operators buying more application
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.520]   installs.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.520]   So not only is Facebook have question, ethics, they are building a whole ecosystem.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.280]   Being a platform for privacy invasion.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   Exactly.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.720]   And for doing all kinds of things like what Zingo was doing with those offers.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.080]   And I give Mark Pincus, who disclaimers a personal friend of mine credit for getting rid of those
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.240]   offers he put he left.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   Did he really though?
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.240]   Did he really?
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.920]   He turned all of those offers off.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.320]   And I had I had two hour phone calls with him over the last during that period of time.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.400]   And I was like, dude, this is not good for your brand.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.760]   This is going to be the end of it for you.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.200]   You have to get away from these things.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.200]   It's not worth it.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.200]   He turned him off.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.920]   He walked away probably from 50 to $100 million a year in those offers.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.680]   They were probably 20% of the money he was making.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.200]   And he walked away from it, which is a big deal for, you know, a business, but not a
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.680]   difficult decision on a are you long your brand or you short your brand.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.320]   He needs to be long his brand.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.520]   And when people find out, oh, if I play if people found out, oh, if I play these games,
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.640]   my information is getting stolen.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.640]   That's it.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.520]   They'll stop playing those games.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.360]   It just worries me a little bit that maybe now maybe I'm changing my mind, John, that
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.120]   it's not a blunder because you see somebody's built this platform.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.840]   What's really kind of sad is that they didn't even have to do this.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.440]   There's plenty of opportunities to make tons of money in Facebook with opt in.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.240]   I still think it's a blunder.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.240]   If they opted it was.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.240]   It's a careless.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   It's a careless.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   They're careless.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.960]   I mean, Jason thinks they're incompetent.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960]   You're now taking sides.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.680]   I'm starting to think they're not so incompetent.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.200]   I think about other examples.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.360]   Beak in this quiz issue.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.360]   Maybe.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360]   Maybe you're convincing me.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   I don't want to hear anymore.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.160]   Do you think we could get away with making legislation that makes opt in the law of the
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.160]   land?
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.640]   I don't think there's the will to do that.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.840]   It seems like a clumsy solution.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.480]   Just making a law blank of law seems to have a lot of unintended consequences.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.000]   I think that what's happening right now is the right way to police it.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.680]   I think Jason's method of getting the bright daylight on it has a sterilizing effect.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.880]   I think things will move right.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.960]   I mean, if you look at what happened with the Apple issue, we spent what six months on
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:22.080]   this program talking about Apple running the application store in a heavy handed method.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.120]   Now you have Android in the market and you have Apple taking a different approach to the
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.520]   app store getting a little bit better, a little more open perhaps.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.600]   I do agree that the pundits can have an effect, but it's a limited effect and it's
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.680]   a review mirror effect.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:41.720]   These people should be behaving themselves and they have a privacy expert at Facebook.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.600]   They hired some guy after Beacon to be like the privacy guy.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.000]   If you look at how they worded that box, I think John was snickering during it.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.760]   Rightfully so, well, these are to help you and we're here to help you.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.600]   If you have friends like this where helping you, trust me, you don't need enemies.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.720]   Let's take the ACLU quiz.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.480]   When you take a quiz on Facebook, what can the quiz see about you?
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.800]   Everybody now wants your answers.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.880]   Only your answers to its questions.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.720]   Only information that is said is public on your profile.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.480]   Almost everything on your profile, even if you use privacy settings to limit its access.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.400]   I'm sure it's only answers to the questions.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.880]   I'm sure nobody.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.200]   It's everything, even if you said no.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.840]   By the way, as you take it, they will then, oh, I can't go back.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.040]   They will then say, oh, this is what we know about you.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.920]   Look at the event you just said yes to.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.800]   Look at the, oh, now I've lost it because I have to go back.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.920]   I pressed the back button.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.920]   They're like what we know about you.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920]   You're an idiot.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920]   You're a good moron.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.920]   You're a bad moron.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:39.920]   You're a bad moron.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.920]   Okay.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.920]   So all Facebook applications and quizzes override your privacy settings?
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.960]   Apparently you agree to that with everyone.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.920]   What info about you can a quiz see when your friends take a quiz?
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.640]   Now, now this is the one that really scares me.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.320]   So I'm not taking a quiz, but John's my friend on Facebook.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.320]   He's a moron.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.320]   He takes a quiz.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.400]   Guess what?
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.200]   They can see everything about me.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.200]   I can?
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.040]   So check out what this quiz can see about some of your friends.
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.440]   Now I'm taking a quiz, but this is what I'm going to learn about my friends.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.080]   Oh, I guess it didn't show it.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.400]   There must be some safeguards here, right?
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.760]   My information is safe because Facebook's default privacy settings prevent application
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.120]   developers scouring my information.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.800]   Facebook carefully screens developers.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.880]   Facebook uses technical measures to limit how developers collecting used personal information.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.800]   None of the above.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.800]   And that's a problem.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   Is that the spoil alert?
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.600]   Is that every one of these is the worst possible scenario?
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.520]   It's an easy quiz.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.280]   If you're worried about the quiz, it's very easy.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.440]   So what do I do?
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.960]   Give up and quit Facebook forever.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.840]   Resign myself to losing control of my personal information.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.680]   Donate money to the ACLU.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:48.800]   Demand the right to control my information without sacrificing the right to use new technology.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.440]   I think that's what we're saying here.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.440]   And if you do take the quiz, and I don't know, it may be that this has changed.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.600]   They do give you a link to update your privacy settings, but they will also show you what
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.080]   they've learned about you from--
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.680]   By the way, the chat room's making some weird allegations.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.480]   They say the thing is, Leo, nobody with a brain actually enters information into Facebook.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.560]   And I couldn't disagree more.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.280]   I would say the vast majority.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.280]   I did.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280]   Of course.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.240]   Because that was the whole thing is sold on is be honest with us, and we will share your
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.440]   information with your friends, and you'll be able to find unique ways that you guys match
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   up together.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.240]   That's the whole way, the Bill of Goods, that made it better than MySpace.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:29.680]   You know, Ben Mezrich in his book, "The Accidental Billionaires," the story of Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.880]   It says the reason Mark Zuckerberg wrote Facebook was because it was a great way to hook up.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.800]   Yeah, he was looking for dates.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.800]   It was a story.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.960]   And if you think about it, that's what's sexy about Facebook.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960]   That's what you find by the way.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.560]   A lot of some of these sites that do the dating sites were set up by guys who were just looking
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560]   at cherry pick.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.320]   Well, even if not, why do you think it went viral?
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:58.440]   Because a bunch of Harvard undergraduates said, "Oh, I can find some chicks on here."
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.040]   And I think in some subtle way that's really still what's going on with Facebook, not maybe
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:08.040]   to hook up, but that is the, you got to have a carrot, and the carrot is, so to speak.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.120]   It does combine quite a few things.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.040]   I mean, I use it mostly for just keeping track of people's birthdays, but it's also that
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.400]   like six degrees of separation where what about a friend of my friend who is probably
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.600]   an old friend of mine that I haven't hooked up with in a while or talked to in a while,
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.480]   and being able to connect with those people.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.880]   And for that, it's pretty neat, but you do give up a lot of on the side of privacy in
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.760]   terms of, you know, when was the other information just being posted?
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.760]   If we haven't seen Red Enough, one more story on Facebook, then we're going to move on.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:46.480]   Health insurers caught paying Facebook gamers virtual currency to oppose reform bill.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.480]   Oopsie.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:52.320]   Facebook users playing games like Farmville, for instance, get addicted.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.320]   Mafia Wars.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.760]   Friends for sale.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.400]   Looking for virtual goods.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.680]   Now, this was the scam that you were talking about earlier, Jason, that Zinga stopped doing,
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.440]   but there are still third party offers that they can accept, right?
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:10.880]   And one of them is a anti-reform group called Get Health Reform Right.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:18.160]   They will pay you virtual currency so you can buy a fence for your virtual pig by taking
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.920]   the survey and on completion, sending an email to your congressional representative saying,
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.560]   "I am concerned a new government plan could cause me to lose the employer coverage I have
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.560]   today.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.160]   More government bureaucracy will only create more problems."
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.360]   Does the Can Let Letter?
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:36.360]   And it says it automatically.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.360]   That's diabolical.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.360]   I like that diabolical.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.360]   It's lame.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.360]   It's lame.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.360]   It gave me a break.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.360]   This stuff doesn't work.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.320]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.680]   They really wanted to make their point.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.240]   When your pig got sick, you'd have to fill out forms and triplicate to the bat.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.160]   Then you could make their head.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.640]   And then you'd have something.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.640]   I don't know.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:59.480]   People should go look at the Robert Reich blog and read his commentary about the...
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.480]   Robert Reich, of course, was the Secretary of Labor under Clinton.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.680]   He has a really good blog, a public affairs blog, and he has some very interesting things
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.160]   to say about this situation with healthcare right now.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.800]   And a lot of it has to do with the fact that they're exempt from antitrust and check it
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.800]   out.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.800]   I will.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:16.800]   I will.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.520]   We're going to take a break, come back and talk more about the news of the week.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.400]   We've got a great cast of characters in here, John C. Devorek from Channel Devorek.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.880]   We've got the great Robert Herron back.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.880]   Haven't seen him at ages.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.320]   It's so nice to see you again.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:32.960]   Robert Robert's website is heronfidelity.com.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.160]   Brian Brushwood of the new NSFW, the latest Twitch show.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.600]   He's showing off his switcher right now.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.520]   And also, of course, of scam school.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520]   What?
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.520]   You booze.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.000]   That was the drinking game we came up with.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.440]   We had Dr. Tiki on, so we decided we needed to invent a drinking game.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.920]   So we came up with you booze where it's like you look at the comments on YouTube and you
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:59.440]   drink once for racism, drink once for homophobia, drink once for all caps, drink for incomplete
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.440]   sentences.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440]   We got hammered.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440]   It's a great show.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.720]   Tuesday nights at 10 p.m. Eastern, right?
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.480]   7 p.m. Pacific at live.tv and it's soon to be delivered to your Roku box and your iTunes
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.080]   and everything else.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:18.720]   Also here with us, Jason Calick, canis, also known as I feel the need for speed top gun
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.760]   Calick, and from Mahalo.com and on the phone with us who's hung on.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.840]   I'm glad he's hung in there.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.640]   Jason Howell from Buzzat Lab, B-O-L dot C-net dot com.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.280]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.240]   Now, Jason, it's time to talk about audible dot com.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.240]   What?
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.240]   Oh.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   So good.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.600]   I went back last year.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.680]   You didn't tell me that audible for sponsoring this week.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.160]   Has nobody made a song out of Jason's songs yet?
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   Oh, there is one.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.160]   Now they really?
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.160]   It's awesome.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.880]   Jason's audible ringtone, I think, is a classic.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.120]   Let me see if I can find that real quickly.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.560]   So audible is the place you go to get audiobooks.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.560]   Great audiobooks.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.560]   65,000 total audiobooks.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.560]   Here he comes.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.560]   Here he comes.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.560]   Here it is.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.880]   Oh, the audio is not real good on it, but there he is.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.240]   Even even when we're in the shades, the top gun shades.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.240]   I don't think that's a movie.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.240]   I think that's him right now.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.560]   I think you're right.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560]   I think you're right.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.160]   Jason Calicannis loves audible.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.240]   Oh, we all love audible.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.400]   If you've got time in the car, if you're driving, I know it should you love it too.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:34.320]   If you use, you do a lot of flying because you go out of town for your magic performances.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.960]   And there's nothing like having a library of wonderful books available at your beck and
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.320]   call and audible is just the greatest way to put those together.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.680]   You can download a book in just a minute or two, have it on your iPod, your Zoom, your
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.280]   iPhone, any playback device works great with Ford's sync, by the way.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:52.560]   When I get in my car, my iPhone hooks up with a Bluetooth and immediately starts playing
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.120]   the book where I left off.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.600]   So it's just wonderful.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.040]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/TwitTo.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.800]   You could get the audible platinum account.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:05.600]   When you do the platinum account on audible, you get two books a month and kind of as a
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.080]   way to get you involved, audible is going to give you the first two books absolutely
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.800]   free.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.080]   Like any crack dealer.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.080]   Yeah, right.
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.080]   They know.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.080]   They know.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.760]   The great thing is people don't realize they say, "Oh, you get two books a month," right?
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.120]   And so then you're busy one month and you're like, "Oh my God, I didn't pick my books."
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.720]   The next month you come and you have four books.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.320]   And so it's not like you take them away.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.320]   No, no, you keep it forever.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.680]   And they just build up and all of a sudden after you get 24 books, maybe you've only
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.680]   listened to 15.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.680]   Then you go on vacation.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.680]   It's a matter of your bookshelve.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.680]   Then you're on.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.680]   And I tell you what happens.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   We're on our computer so much.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.000]   You ever get that thing, your eyes start to hurt.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   So I'm on a flight.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   My eyes are hurting.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   I have books.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.400]   My eyes, I have to use my eyes for when I'm doing email, whatever.
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:55.480]   And it's just nice to be able to sit back, put in the earbuds, put on my audio, technical
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.920]   noise canceling headphones, which are better than the Bose ones and different ones.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   That's the ones I have.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.920]   I love those too, yeah.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.440]   And the audio technical ones are half the price.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.640]   And you put them on the noise cancellation and just try it.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.800]   Sit in your backyard, sit on a flight, sit on a park bench, do it for half an hour at
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.960]   lunch and I'm telling you to be refreshed.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   And you're going to be intelligent.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.960]   Because who can keep up with reading books these days?
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   You want to be intelligent.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.560]   Cocktail parties, you can say, oh yeah, I read that.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.560]   And you did.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.560]   Of course, I read that.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.560]   Yeah, sure.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560]   Of course.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.560]   I know all about it.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.560]   I got that.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.560]   Of course.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:26.760]   That's, you know, I do that all the time for technical books like free Chris Anderson's
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.560]   book that I, you know, you have to read.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.560]   Absolutely.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.560]   If you're in the business, Googled by Ken Aolletta.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.960]   I'm doing all the, what's his name?
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.760]   Malcolm Gladwell with the Afro.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.760]   All outliers and tipping.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.760]   All outliers.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.360]   So it's a great, I'm playing poker.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.880]   I'm listening to outliers.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.880]   These guys are like talking about nonsense and I'm listening to something really interesting
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.160]   and educational and taking their money.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.160]   I love it.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.680]   Audible has made me so much money at the poker table for that reason alone.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.680]   It pays for itself.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.880]   We don't recommend that or even say that this is possible.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.040]   But here's the book I want to recommend now.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.560]   This is the new George Clooney movie just coming out now up in the air where he plays
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.880]   the guy who flies around and fires people.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.880]   He's a termination expert.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.160]   And what I didn't know is it's based on a wickedly funny novel by Walter Kim called.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.400]   Oh, is that a book?
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.400]   Yes.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400]   Up in the air.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.200]   Oh, I've got one of my choices for this month.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.200]   Exactly.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:18.360]   This is eight hours and 59 minutes of laugh out loud fun of witty satire.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.440]   I think this is going to be a great audible pick.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.160]   But this is again, that's an example of, you know, whenever the movie comes out, I always
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.440]   get the book first because when I listen to an audio book from Audible, it just brings
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.440]   them.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.120]   It's better than a movie really brings it a lot.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.560]   I see it in my mind.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.200]   And so I like to I do like to read the book before I see the movie.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:39.760]   Is the side effect of that that every movie you go see or just like, book was better.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760]   Often.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760]   I would imagine so.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.760]   Isn't that always the case?
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.760]   I mean, usually anyway.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.760]   Yeah, but it's nice to see both sometimes.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.760]   I like to see both.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.120]   It gives you like a little more perspective.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.520]   Like I, so I listened to the road.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.160]   Oh, there's an example.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.640]   Which is one of the greatest audio books.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.640]   Or Mac McCarthy.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.640]   Yep.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.880]   And now there's the movie and then there were shadow divers, the audio book, which is
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.080]   your movie coming out.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.280]   No, I understand that they were talking about making a movie for a long time.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280]   But let me tell you something.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.000]   I have shadow divers in my mind.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.320]   Those two books alone, the road and shadow divers, I guarantee you, if you don't like
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.320]   them, I will.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.320]   That's a good start.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.320]   There you go.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.440]   That's an incredible start right there.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:18.160]   And if you're a poker player, Barry Greenstein's Ace on the River is a must read.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.160]   Must read.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.120]   By the way, I, if, I know we've got a million books, but I did want to sneak one in.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.000]   I just started and I can't remember the last time I've been so instantly excited to book
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   from the get go.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.400]   I already read World War Z, which is an amazing audio book with an all star cast.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   About zombies.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.160]   And I got the zombie survival guy.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.160]   I love zombies.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.800]   Which is phenomenal by, by Max Brooks.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.960]   Highly recommended already loving it.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.160]   I love, is there a zombie category on, uh, there are a lot of me.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.280]   There's enough zombie books on Audible now, including pride and prejudice.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.600]   History, kids, romance, zombies.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.520]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:55.120]   So we just gave you like five books, but this is what happens with Audible users is when
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.120]   we get together.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.400]   That's the first question is like, what do you want it?
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   What do you, what's good?
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   What do you listen to lately?
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400]   Pride and Prejudice and zombies.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   Yep.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.280]   It's great to, it's great to be a member of Audible and encourage you to do it.

[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.080]   They do my show.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.080]   And I'm going to, I'm going to tweet right now.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.040]   Thanks to Audible_COM.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.040]   That's their account on Twitter.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.160]   Thanks to @audible_com.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.680]   Check out www.audible.com/twit.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.480]   That's what I'm going to do that and I'm going to put pound twit on the end.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.480]   I guess thank you.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   Thank you.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.280]   Because it's up to you as the people who listen to the show to thank the sponsors, patronized
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.320]   sponsors, especially when they're doing good stuff.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.240]   You know what I've decided to do this kind of weird and I don't know if this is going
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:50.680]   to be a good idea or not, but people have started to say, well, why do you still accept
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.520]   donations if you've got ads?
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.640]   So I said, well, that's a good point.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.680]   When we started for the first two years, Twit was run totally on the donations.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.680]   Do you remember that Robert Herron?
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.680]   That was how it is?
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:01.680]   Oh totally.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.680]   I'm going to take a couple of steps.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:30.680]   Unpay me.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.680]   They can take money from your account.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:36.680]   If they could, if they could, I wish there were, if I could figure, if anybody could find
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.680]   on a way to do this, only-
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.680]   You'd be drained the next day because of one guy.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.680]   No, no, no, what I would say is-
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.680]   I think it's not worth $100,000.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.680]   Here's how I would do it.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:47.680]   I would say only to the amount you've donated plus $1.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.680]   So even if you'd never donated, you could take a dollar out.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.680]   Okay, here's the big question, though, that you're going to have to answer if you're going
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.680]   to go in this direction.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:54.680]   Ready?
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.680]   I already went in this direction.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.680]   No, no, I got it better.
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:57.680]   I got something else.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.680]   This is the question that people need to know about.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.280]   It's not like you're not making enough money.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.680]   What do you got there?
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.680]   Oh, there's Leo's tip chart.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.680]   No, that's it.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:09.680]   There is a tip jar in here with money in it that apparently guests who come on the show
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:14.680]   are forced to pull out the wall and throw, and there's a hundred sitting on the top that
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.680]   somebody coughed up.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.680]   Where'd that come from?
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680]   I don't know.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.680]   Probably from me.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.680]   John, come on.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.680]   You carry around $100 bills.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.680]   That wasn't in there when I started today.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.480]   So, yeah, you're not required to, but if anybody wants, we'll just pass the hat right
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.480]   now.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.480]   If anybody wants to get you, you could do it.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.440]   And I don't know if this is an interesting experiment or if it's something that would
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:37.880]   generate publicity, but you could do what's the company that lets you buy and sell stock
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:38.880]   in anything?
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.880]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:43.880]   Yeah, you can actually have a fund where people could buy stock in Leo to show their
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.160]   support or sell it if they're not happy with it.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.400]   That's a good idea.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.800]   How many puppies die if they don't donate?
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.280]   No puppies die.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:56.560]   I did say this on my blog that I do have a day job, the radio show, so my family will
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.160]   not go hungry, but more than half my income this year came from Twitch.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:03.520]   So, I'm basically giving up more than half my income if people don't like it.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.120]   All they have to do is go to Twitch.tv.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.480]   It's instead of saying donate to Twitch, it now says Leo's tip jar, tip Leo, something
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.640]   like that.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.160]   And that's what we're going to do with the donations.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.960]   And you know, if you don't give me any money, that's fine.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:14.960]   I'll just go home.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.760]   I'll let John run the show for the long haul.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:17.760]   You're going to take his ball.
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.760]   You're going to take his ball.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:19.760]   You can have your own twist.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.360]   No, you know, people have already been very generous with the ball.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.920]   Known with the, with the, with the tip jar.
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.400]   Look at there's $100 bill in there.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.760]   And that's something I'll be eating tonight.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.760]   So that's, I don't know.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.960]   You think that's crazy, but I think it would be nice if you could pay CEOs what you think
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:37.520]   they're worth instead of them deciding what they think is a futile effort.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.520]   Try lightly.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.520]   You don't like that idea.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.520]   Try lightly.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.560]   That idea is crazy, man.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.560]   You're crazy.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:46.560]   It's crazy.
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:53.160]   I, I, I, so, I need, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
